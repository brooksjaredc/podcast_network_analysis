Along with co-host and fellow pop culture fanatic Frank Santopadre, Gilbert is joined by comics, actors, musicians, talk show hosts, writers and other eyewitnesses to Hollywood history, including Bruce Dern, Chevy Chase, “Weird Al” Yankovic, Adam West, Steve Buscemi, Micky Dolenz, Jim Gaffigan, Judd Apatow and DOZENS more, for a funny, frenetic, fly-on-the-wall look at showbiz then and now (but mostly then.)

Gilbert Gottfried’s Amazing Colossal Podcast was named ""Best Podcast of 2015"" by the Village Voice and one of iTunes' ""Best of 2014."" It has been featured in Rolling Stone, Wired and the Los Angeles Times."

['Jesse Thorn', 'Jordan Morris']	http://feeds.feedburner.com/thornmorris	http://static.libsyn.com/p/assets/0/b/e/3/0be3e67ee172f720/JJGoCoverArt1600px.jpg	['Comedy', 'Arts', 'Society & Culture']		clean_jordan_jesse_go	"What is the dumbest show you can imagine? This award-winning show may be dumber. 

It has no content. No format. Yet it's going on ten years of delighting hundreds of thousands of people. It's been an iTunes editors choice, and Rolling Stone picked it as one of the world's best comedy podcasts. It's light in the dark, comfort in the cold and a penguin in the pants (long story). 

Join hosts Jesse Thorn (NPR's Bullseye) and Jordan Morris (Comedy Central's @Midnight) and a celebrity guest on a raucous, vulgar and warm-hearted romp that will probably leave you a better person. And will certainly make you dumber."
