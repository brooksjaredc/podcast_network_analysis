		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Not-great-relationship advice from completely unqualified Hollywood types. 

I am a solid 3.4 student with a major in English from the University of Washington. I've also been asked what my SAT score was and it was 1060. It only took five years of dorm/rave life for me to accrue the life knowledge I have received. I’m a Sagittarius, which means I’m super creative and stubborn; but there are walls I need to break down because I always want to leap over the boundaries that make me climb ladders and roofs. I’m agreeable and delightful. I also have incredible leadership skills and following abilities. And, I have 20/20 vision so I’m an eagle eye. I could not love all of you more and please e-mail me at questions@annafarisisunqualified.com with your pressing relationship questions.]]></itunes:summary>

Then, Anna and Sim check in with previous callers to see how their unqualified advice panned out. They first follow up with Giovanni (Julia Stiles episode), who was contemplating whether to tell his family that he’s gay and living with his boyfriend. Next, they talk to Polly (Jason Mantzoukas episode), who decided to tell her conservative Christian parents that she’s in love with a Jewish man. Tune in and see how they're doing now!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Anna and Sim are gearing up for football season and need some advice about how to get their significant others to enjoy their first fantasy football seasons. So who better to call than ESPN fantasy football guru Matthew Berry? Listen in as Anna and Matthew strategize about how she can help Chris win his celebrity league--and beat out Chris Evans and John Krasinski! Matthew and Sim also discuss why women who aren't normally football fans (like Matthew's wife and Sim's girlfriend) should give fantasy football a chance. But don't worry, it's not all football talk! Anna and Sim put Matthew through the ringer with a "Relationship DealBreaker or Not: Football Edition," and find out that football statistics aren't all he's good at analyzing.  Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

Her call to the Unqualified gang leads to a surprisingly thoughtful discussion on what constitutes “cheating.” Then, Anna, Sim, and Eric talk to Jessica, who is freaked out because the rich guy she’s currently dating may be too good to be true.  By the way, if at times you feel like you’re listening to a completely different Eric Andre, there is a reason for that.

Join in the fun in Part 2 of this episode, as Chelsea and Anna get a new -- and unusual -- kind of buzz. The gang then hits the phones to dish out some unqualified advice. First, Anna, Sim and Chelsea offer some tough love to a woman concerned that her sister is set to marry a guy she met just two months ago, despite NUMEROUS red flags.  Then, the gang tries to help a caller figure out what to do after she finally made out with her long-time crush…but he hasn’t spoken to her for two months since.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea Handler is unfiltered, unapologetic and unlike anyone else. The comedian/talk show host joins Anna and Sim this week, bringing to bear her acerbic wit and take-no-prisoners approach to love and life. In Part 1 of this two-part episode, Chelsea explains why she hates compliments, terms she finds most offensive and what exactly it takes to be her friend. She and Anna also trade break-up stories (you won’t believe how ballsy Chelsea is!) and discuss other dating misadventures. Then, in a new segment, Sim gives Anna and Chelsea twenty guesses to identify a mystery celebrity guest-caller. (See if you can figure out who it is before they do!) After Anna’s unbridled excitement subsides, the trio reflects upon the “intoxicating” effect of fame and the ups and downs of life in the Hollywood spotlight.  <br />  <br /> Be sure to tune in tomorrow for Part 2 – you definitely won’t want to miss the surprise gift that Anna and Sim have in store for Chelsea!<br /> <br /> Please rate us on iTunes and leave us a review!

His madcap energy is on full display when he joins Anna and Sim for this week's episode of "Unqualified." Among other memorable moments, Jason shares an outrageous story about how one unfortunate incident forever changed his "laissez-faire attitude towards farting." Anna and Jason also showcase their improv skills by role-playing a scene in which a stoner college drop-out (Jason) applies for a job as the second assistant to a powerful movie studio executive (Anna). The gang also handles some tricky calls this week. First, they talk to a caller whose gay BFF set her up with a man who he himself has a crush on. Then, Jason and Anna have a heart-to-heart with a woman whose family disapproves of her dating a Jewish man.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Olivia Munn truly is every guy's dream girl. Beautiful, brilliant, and funny as hell, the self-described "Prince Harry of Maxim" joins Anna and Sim for this week's two-part episode. Join in on the fun as Olivia and Anna discuss Olivia's desire to hold a baby panda, her deep-seated fear of brain-eating amoebas, and her search for the truth about post-baby vaginas. Olivia also explains why she froze her eggs, and (jokingly) offers to be Anna's surrogate. But don't worry, guys, there plenty of football talk too, as one might expect from the girlfriend of NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers. Anna and Olivia even role-play a conversation about football between Chris Pratt and Anna -- with Anna playing Chris!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Olivia Munn truly is every guy's dream girl. Beautiful, brilliant, and funny as hell, the self-described "Prince Harry of Maxim" joins Anna and Sim for this week's two-part episode. Join in on the fun as Olivia and Anna discuss Olivia's desire to hold a baby panda, her deep-seated fear of brain-eating amoebas, and her search for the truth about post-baby vaginas. Olivia also explains why she froze her eggs, and (jokingly) offers to be Anna's surrogate. But don't worry, guys, there plenty of football talk too, as one might expect from the girlfriend of NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers. Anna and Olivia even role-play a conversation about football between Chris Pratt and Anna -- with Anna playing Chris!

They also help a male caller decide whether to bring a date to a wedding where he'll see his longtime crush with her new boyfriend! And you won't want to miss what Anna blurted out at a McDonald's outing with Chris! This episode is a MUST listen!</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> Credits:</p> <p>Co-host and Produced by: Sim Sarna Technical Producer: Mike Flinn Theme song by: Mondo Cozmo Website by: Will Plyer twitter: @annafarispod IG: annafarispod facebook.com/annafarisisunqualified http://www.annafarisisunqualified.com</p>]]></content:encoded>

The gang gives plenty of unqualified advice too, this time to a woman who may or may not be in love with her platonic best friend, and a gay man whose straight college buddies are pressuring him to stay in the closet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You're in for a real treat today! In this week's episode of "Unqualified," Anna and cohost/producer Sim Sarna welcome one of the most unique comedic talents in Hollywood: the one and only Aubrey Plaza! Listen as they discuss Andy and April's relationship from "Parks and Rec," and Aubrey's audition for "Star Wars." Among other hilarious moments, Anna and Aubrey consider their preferred murder weapons and why mens' balls smell like stale cheerios.

An unexpected internet outage means there aren’t any listener calls in this episode, but David more than makes up for it with his hilarious insights into the male mind. He recounts how he began to date his now-wife on the heels of a tough breakup when he was just 25 years old and purposefully NOT looking for love. Anna and David also share their views on older men dating much younger women. Plus, the gang plays a hysterical—and raunchy—round of "Would You Rather."
