And yet throughout, she’s joking and positive.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mary Katharine Ham, author of End of Discussion and CNN political commentator, makes her fourth appearance on the show to talk about life after the sudden and tragic loss of her beloved husband Jake Brewer. He was killed in a cycling accident in September during a ride for charity. Because both Mary Katharine and Jake were public figures (Jake worked at the White House and had previously worked at Change.org), there was a bit of a media circus that surrounded the news. We discussed this experience as well as the adjustment from happily married mother with another on the way (she was seven months pregnant at the time of the accident) to widow with two young children. In the midst of it all, Mary Katharine made a career transition as well, leaving Fox News and joining CNN. We also talked about childbirth, the way young children form and keep memories, grieving as an extrovert, a memory of Jake that Mary Katharine's older daughter recently shared, meditative prayer, therapy, strength, what Anderson Cooper and Jake Tapper are like behind the scenes, mini quiches and Starbucks, the current election, a PSA about wills and what Mary Katharine wants people to remember about Jake. In addition we took listener questions over Twitter and did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedian Ben Hoffman (The Ben Show), who's currently doing interviews as his country musician alter ego Wheeler Walker Jr., agreed to be himself—the Ben part of himself that is—for his return to the show which took place on the eve of his first tour as Wheeler. Wheeler Walker Jr.'s self-financed album, Redneck Shit, is a surprise hit. It debuted at number nine on the Billboard country charts and number one on the comedy charts. The album, with songs like "Fuck You Bitch" and "Which One O Your Queers Gonna Suck My Dick?" isn't a parody, though it's been mistaken for one. It's a solid country album with genuine bonafides. And lyrically, though it's definitely comedy, it's got real emotion behind it: the emotion Hoffman doesn't get to express as himself. As he explains, Wheeler is his release. We also talked about the state of country music, being OCD, whether Wheeler is Ben's id, making an album that's unplayable on the radio, beefs with the press, relationships, dick pics and so much more. Plus we did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I first met comedian and actress Tiffany Haddish (Keanu, The Carmichael Show) when we both appeared on a radio show and ever since then I've hoped to have her on ARIYNBF. I'd heard bits and pieces of her story and got the sense she'd had a rough upbringing but I wasn't quite prepared for the intensity of what she'd experienced. Abusive parents, foster care, living in her car, an abusive first husband, care taking from the age of 8, and even as I write this I feel as if I'm not conveying the particulars that make her story so powerful. And yet throughout, she's joking and positive. In addition, we talked about the importance of trusting your first mind, when she was misquoted by TMZ, auditioning for SNL, the help she received from Kevin Hart, arguing with Dane Cook, Six Flags abortions, eating rat meat, peach jello, audition makeup and so much more. We also did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>

I love that she claims to have looked like "a little red-headed gentleman" until she was 19, I love that she describes herself as "silly and rascally" and I love listening to her talk about how for her, stand up has been a spiritual journey. Also, there's the story about what happened to her lady parts while enthusiastically doing the worm onstage but that one just makes me want to cross my legs for eternity. In addition, on this episode we talked about The Bachelor, Arden's parents marrying on a dare and her relationship with each of them, salty dogs, Mad TV and what all the women performers had in common, working as an elf at Macy's, losing her special sauce, body image, insomnia and so much more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I knew Gustavo way back when I was leaving the OC Weekly and he was starting there. He came out of nowhere it seemed and was suddenly writing a zillion articles a week which, I heard at the time, didn't exactly endear him to the other writers. He went on to gain attention and notoriety with his now nationally syndicated "Ask a Mexican" column, author three books and become the editor-in-chief of the paper. He also regularly appears on radio programs and is a consulting producer on Fox's animated Bordertown. We chatted about his beginnings and how he got to where he is today including growing up the son of "Mexican hillbillies," not quite fitting in, falling in love with film and Pulp Fiction in particular, being a nerd, being repeatedly unaware of office politics, the satirical letter that changed his life, his relationship with former OC Weekly editor Will Swaim and so much more.

We talked about his podcast How to Be Amazing and his approach to interviewing before delving into some of the meatier topics explored in his most recent book—which I loved and highly recommend—Navel Gazing: True Tales of Bodies, Mostly Mine (but also my mom's which I know sounds weird). We chatted about growing up in a home filled with rage, growing up without much male influence, his gay-but-not-aware-of-it-yet mother being subjected to shock treatment by her parents and his theories about what led to this, his choice to live in Connecticut and thoughts about Los Angeles, whether people expect him to be more snarky  than he is and his desire to be a good person.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I like to think I was something of a precocious whippersnapper, but writer, director, producer, podcaster, television personality Jake Fogelnest (Wet Hot American Summer, Billy On The Street, Difficult People) has me beat. At age 7 he wanted to be John Waters... and then actually contacted and spoke with John Waters. (I merely wrote a fan letter to animal expert Joan Embery and received a perfunctory written reply.) He went on to host a public access show, Squirt TV, from his bedroom in Manhattan which was later picked up by MTV all before going to rehab at the age of 17. Eventually he found UCB which is when, he says, his real career began. We discussed all this plus Terry Gross, The Monkees, the difference between Adam Driver and Ryan Seacrest, sobriety, resentments, self-care, selling out and so much more.

Just kidding, it's me, the person who was awake for a harrowing surgical prep and who has maybe changed her mind a little about Versed because it turns out certain kinds of discomfort cut right through the haze and wake you right the fuck up. Also waking me up? The steroids they put in the IV during the last egg retrieval. But this episode isn't only fert alerts, we also learned what everyone did for New Year's Eve. One person's evening involved a magician! Also we discussed hypnosis, both the parlor trick kind and the therapeutic kind and then we had an extra special snack chat involving chill pipes and Utah's own chocolate cinnamon bears. Then things nearly came to blows over Red Vines vs. Twizzlers and other controversial candy and we did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

We also talked about fatherhood, how he met his wife, relationships in general, how he differs from his CrabFeast cohost Ryan Sickler, his love of rude people, Best Bars in America and so much more.

We did a full on count down with noisemakers that you can sync up to midnight. Did Alison's landlord call in the middle? Oh yes. But surprisingly it wasn't about the noise! Also on this special year end episode I recount Daniel and my New York odyssey which included a lot of vomit and an encounter or two with TSA. Plus we talk about our New Year's resolutions, Greg's text exchange wherein he tried to talk his 13 year old nephew out of a Paul Reed Smith guitar, cacao, snack chat, the upcoming new website, Jenna and Al's time in Utah, the significance of this year (recorded on the anniversary of THE EMAIL) and so much more. We also did a round of New Year's Eve themed JMOES. Happy New Year, everyone!</p>]]></description>

They also handle SNL's opening credits every year—a discovery which led to my learning two of my favorite new terms: "lens whacking" and "pixel sticking."  On this episode we talked about the experience of working on SNL and the process of shooting the filmed pieces, holding panic at bay, how they met each other, racing against the clock, working with Lorne, Alex commuting to NYC every week, how they each got their start, the process of directing, producing and shooting Documentary Now!, early films they made, other projects they're working on and so much more.

We also talked about Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays and my strange relationship with Judaism and why it sometimes feels icky when people make a point of saying "Happy Holidays" or rather, why it felt icky growing up. But this one isn't all conflict and outing Santa. We also talk about soda wars, what everyone's doing for the holidays, Greg's eczema, favorite Christmas programming and an off-the-cuff Christmas-themed #AL quiz.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bill Schulz <em>(Red Eye, NY Times)</em> and I go way back to my early-ish days in New York when we both worked for magazines and played on separate competitive skee-ball teams. We forgot to talk about skee-ball but we talked about everything else and I mean EVERYTHING, even when it got a little uncomfortable. Anyway, as I explain on the show, I worked for a magazine and had started appearing regularly on television and thought I was hot shit so when fellow magazine writer Bill told me Maxim UK editor Greg Gutfeld was coming back from England to start a TV show and he was going to be a part of it, I was pretty sure it wouldn't last because I was probably the only writer to successfully make the transition to TV because let's face it, people who work at magazines are not on-camera people. That show was <em>Red Eye</em> and I was spectacularly wrong. Bill was a fundamental part of the program so like a lot of people, I was pretty surprised to hear he was no longer with the show. We discussed his leaving—along with some comparisons of our separate similar experiences—plus some of what led up to the split and his feelings about the situation. We also talked about his writing career, his <em>New York Times</em> column, men's magazines, relationships, his childhood, discovering a dipshit character in Amy Schumer's <em>Trainwreck</em> may or may not have been based on him, lavish company Christmas parties, wardrobe budgets, talking politics, acrimony and so much more.

Sitting in for Greg was someone who is vaguely similar, recent Monday show guest Mike Carano. I say vaguely similar because like Greg, Mike also wonders if Jenna, #AL and Mormons in general judge him. On this episode we also talked about being "natural" parents, whether Mike is a good judge of character because he realizes he's a bad judge of character, a couple stories from Daniel and my recent visit with Daniel's mom, bawling through Frozen and other movies and musicals, the stress but also the liberation of self check out, being shamed by bank and fast food employees, adults who eat or have eaten baby food (GUILTY!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jack Barakat, lead guitarist for the pop punk band All Time Low and co-host of the Full Frontal Radio podcast was scheduled to be the only guest on this episode so I was surprised when two faces greeted me at the door. "This is my buddy Justin," Jack said as he walked in. "Is it cool if he sits in?" I agreed, since I am an agreeable person, but spent the first many minutes before the mics were on saying, "Wait, who are you and what do you do and what's going on?" It's weird when you've researched the crap out of only fifty percent of your guests. As it turned out, I shouldn't have worried. Justin (who himself is a musician and music exec) and Jack go way back and having Justin there brought a fun dimension to the interview since he was able to provide another perspective and first hand account of many of the topics we touched upon including Jack's investment in rock and roll bars, his relationships and friendships with Holly Madison and Abigail Breslin, his dating habits, writing new material, anorexic aliens, a bathtub full of cheese, black Amex cards, how he met Holly, breakups, whether he's still just a guy from Baltimore, how someone becomes big in Japan, major labels, signing a record deal in high school, partying, chasing a hit single, Bod body spray and what his bandmates smell like, recording his podcast on the road, his childhood, fleeing war torn Beirut when he was a baby, music theory, Rivers Cuomo and so much more. We also took your questions over Twitter and did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

Before the show Greg met her for the first time and announced, "I like holding babies. Holding babies is a thing I like to do." So if anyone is wondering, that's where Greg stands on baby holding. On this episode we got the low-down from Jenna on labor which involved, among other things, a balloon and a hairbrush. It did not involve modesty or a curtain. We also talked about insomnia and my attempts to rid myself of it, everyone's Thanksgivings, pomegranates, toilets, afterbirths and so much more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dana Gould and I sat down for a very rare, honest and unflinching conversation about his recent breakup and divorce along with his experience adopting three children. We also talked about the genesis of his podcast, his thoughts about gun control and the NRA, Al Anon and the two memories that bookend his marriage. I say "rare, honest and unflinching" because I am under the impression Dana doesn't normally pull the curtain back this far. If he does, I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.  I'm pretty convinced this is an exclusive and also a hot scoop. You know, the kind of thing that would have made me yell "podcast boner!" if I weren't so calm and collected. Anyway, I love Dana and think he's one of the best comics around and loved this chance to get to know him a little better, cold hunk of peanut butter and all. We also took your questions over Twitter and did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel and I just had a hearty debate about whether it's a mistake to reveal whose nose was whistling right in the episode title. I pointed out that we already revealed it on last week's show but then he said it's possible people might have missed that one and he personally enjoyed the way it "revealed itself organically." And now here I am, non-organically shoving the info into the show title. Except what are my options, I ask you? "Happy Thanksgiving from Someone's Nose Whistle?" "Happy Thanksgiving from a Mysterious Nose Whistle?" Actually, both of those would have worked but as the woman who did my makeup at my wedding said to me when she put the wrong shade of lipstick on me and I pointed it out, "That ship has sailed, sister!" (I AM TOTALLY OVER IT AND I DEFINITELY DON'T BRING UP MY BURNT SIENNA LIPS WHENEVER I TALK ABOUT MY WEDDING.) Anyway, on this special Thanksgiving episode which was recorded before Jenna had her baby, we talk about all the things we're thankful for as well as toxic pans, Twilight Zone and even more egg talk. Plus we did a round of Just Me Or Everyone. Happy Thanksgiving you guys!</p>]]></description>

What he didn't say, or maybe he did and I forgot, is that they were so loud he was able to record them from his kitchen. He sent me the audio clip but was hesitant to have us play it on the show because he's a decent person. So I did the only smart thing someone in my position could do: listened to it 900 times in order to transcribe it so we could reenact on the show. Also in this episode, Jenna is still extremely pregnant and had a contraction, Greg and Daniel have app ideas and I have an idea for a cologne and also a shoe-musement park, Greg cries during movies and which way to lean while hugging. Plus we did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>]]></description>

Back in the day (and also on the tenth episode of my podcast on which he guested) we fought good-naturedly about all sorts of stuff with the exception of the couple of times it felt not so good-natured. But these days we totally get along. On this episode we talk about ego states, parenthood, the necessity of being totally honest if you're an artist, fame, poetry, Matt's childhood and boarding school experience, his new album, infidelity, his family, his relationship with his parents, the Taylor Swift Incident, Bill Murray and so much more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Showalter and I go way back to 2006-ish when I did a series of interviews for <em>Time Out New York/PS1 Radio</em> (they were very early podcasts, actually) and he was the first person I interviewed. Over the years I've interviewed him many more times and I always love talking with him, probably because I'm such a huge fan of his work from <em>The State</em> to <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> to <em>Stella</em> and now Neftlix's <em>Wet Hot American Summer First Day of Camp</em> (not to mention <em>The Baxter</em> and <em>Mr. Funny Pants</em> and all the projects I'm forgetting). It was fascinating to find out how he regards his own success and how the Netflix series, he says, "changed the narrative." Also he recently made a film called <em>Hello My Name is Doris</em> starring Sally Field and Max Greenfield and it was heartbreaking and beautiful. We also talked hypnotherapy (I was inspired to make an appointment after our conversation), kids, NY work ethics vs. LA work ethics (and the cultural differences in general), cats, tennis and sportiness. Plus we took your questions over twitter and did a round of Just Me Or Everyone. (BTW, still trying this thing where I write the episode summaries in EXTREME FIRST PERSON. Is it still working? Lemme know. Ok bye.)</p>]]></description>

I am to Dirty Diet Coke as Greg Heller is to Mormon Funeral Potatoes. Also, I've decided to write these show descriptions in a different way. What do you think? Lemme know. I can easily go back to taking myself out of the description however let's be real, I am writing these words. Anyhoozles, Jenna and Al and Greg were back on this episode and joined Jeff, Daniel and me for a chat about almost getting run over by a bike on the sidewalk (while I was texting), tap dancing, Adoption vs. IVF and people being kinda dickish online, Greg's fishing and surfing trip, bathroom habits, peach air freshener, the extendo version of The Fruit Song, Greg's dream about Anderson Cooper, shaking hands with the unemployed (i.e. masturbation), Pretty Little Liars, Gilmore Girls and more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Special guest Jordan Morris is back and he's brought a quiz. How well do Alison and the Thursday gang (Jenna Kim Jones, Allan Moss, Daniel Quantz and Jeff Fox) know Jordan? Also where in the world is Greg Heller? Plus Alison's licking disgusting lamb flavored chips and crying in the recovery room, Jenna has pregnancy brain, we're over Vine, everyone's unwrapping cinnamon roles and we're talking ear wax. Plus we did a round of Just Me Or Everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A note about this episode (a #FERTALERT): A day after recording, Alison found out that the egg she was told had a "very low" chance of fertilizing actually DID fertilize overnight and now she and Daniel are happy to say they have another high quality embryo. This will only make sense if you listen to the episode and/or are Alison's doctor.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Dye, comedian and host of MTV's Strangers with Money stopped by this episode of Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend to talk about his perfect teeth and chiseled jaw line as well as his tousled hair and lanky physique.
