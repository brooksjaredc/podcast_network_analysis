        <description>Punch Drunk is, for the most part, a sports podcast.  With 3 headlining stand-up comics and sometimes friends. Ari Shaffir, Sam Tripoli, and Jayson Thibault all met at the Comedy Store and have been friends for over 11 years. All 3 are stand-up comics and big sports fans. This podcast is their sports thoughts, arguments, stories, fights, and bets! The Podcast Tribune called Punch Drunk "an asian massage for the real sports fans".

      <itunes:summary>The whole crew is back on the show and ready to talk about Week 1 of the NFL.  But first, Ari informs everyone that they did not make it on to This Is Not Happening Season 2 on Comedy Central.  So Sam and Jayson keep on keeping their fingers crossed for Season 5 or 7! Ari's drunk red neck cousin called in to talk about how hard he got looking at Thibault last week.  He then either describes what he had to do to take care of his rock hard boner or how much he loves the Cowboys or hates the Cowboys.... maybe we're not quite sure. Then guys then discuss Week 1 of the NFL, the NHL to Vegas, MLB baseball and Nick Diaz and the 5 YEAR SUSPENSION FOR SMOKING WEED. GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY?? All this and more on the latest episode of Punch Drunk Sports.  Please tell a friend about the show.

Punch Drunk is, for the most part, a sports podcast. Sure we will get off subject and discuss which UFC fighter you LEAST wanna get raped by. But its a sports podcast. With 3 headlining stand-up comics and sometimes friends. Ari Shaffir, Sam Tripoli, and Jayson Thibault all met at the Comedy Store and have been friends for over 11 years. All 3 are stand-up comics and big sports fans. This podcast is their sports thoughts, arguments, stories, fights, and bets! The Podcast Tribune called Punch Drunk "an asian massage for the real sports fans".
