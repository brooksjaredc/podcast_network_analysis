Myanmar is amazing. See it before it gets ruined by globalism. Also, I went kind of nuts on the intro and outro.

It happened while I was in Scotland and he wanted to talk about it on my podcast, so as soon as I got home, we made it happen. He was called a "rape apologist." They threatened to rape his girlfriend. He was misquoted and sold out as much as possible to prove a point they didn't know how to make. So he came to my apartment and we talked about it for a while. I interrupted way to much, but I just could not keep up with him. We're also joined by his still unraped girlfriend who tells me how frustrating it was to sit on the jury of an actual botched rape case. It's a weird episode.

He really likes to get off the beaten path and explore new places. I thought I liked seeing things, but Rollins takes it to a whole new level. He goes places I've never even heard of, met people I didn't know existed, done things I'd be too scared to do. It was such a fun conversation and it filled me with wanderlust. </p>]]></description>

But we also got other people in on the fun and went around interviewing people in the street about their favorite delis. Jeff was really busy planning the Comedy Central shoot of the Roast Battle, so we didn't get that much time to talk. So I made up for it a little with a long intro about the beach and a long outro about Shroomfest 2016. Make sure to set your DVRs to record the Roast Battle July 28-31 at 10/9c on Comedy Central. A new round every night until the live final round on Sunday, July 31.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Danish and Oneill met me at my AirBnB in Echo Park while I was in town to shoot This Is Not Happening season 2 (new episodes February 24 at 12:30am) to do an interview about Ari Shaffir. Ari Shaffir is the host of a semi popular comedy podcast called Ari Shaffir's Skeptic Tank. This is the first interview we did and I'm airing it second because so many people wanted me to release it. It takes us from the birth of Ari until his birth as a comedian. It leaves off where episode 250 picks up. So enjoy this interview with the guy on this podcast who never gets asked any questions. It's the first time I don't have to butt in to get my point across. </p>]]></description>

You might remember Patrick as a new father in episode 61. Well, it's been a few years, and I thought it'd be cool to see how he feels about things now. We meander A BUNCH in this episode so don't worry if you don't care about fatherhood. </p>]]></description>

<p>Chris Gethard, Nikki Glaser, and Allison Dore were my guests on a live podcast at the JFL42 comedy festival in Toronto, Canada last month. I never feel comfortable doing these live podcasts because the audience forces the discussion into a more laughs oriented direction. So I decided to test this theory by doing a podcast about suicide at a live show in front of a comedy festival crowd. The results were mixed. But I found it way more interesting than doing a surface podcast just so I could say I did it. So, here's an interesting discussion on suicidal thoughts in an audience that thought they were here for laughs.</p>

So I'm glad he was able to explain to me what I'm missing with wrestling. It always seemed like garbage entertainment for garbage people.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Danis and Ryan O'Neill came over to my AirBnB in LA while I was in town to film my special, Paid Regular. We talked about the open mic at the Comedy Store known as potluck. It was a parade of lunatics. In its prime, potluck was one part freak show, one part standup show, and two parts club soda. Seriously, you had to see it. And I talked to Danish & O'Neill about what it was like hosting that mother week after week. Always great when these guys are on and this one is no exception. And don't forget to watch my special on Comedy Central Friday night January 16 or get the extended version at www.arishaffir.com</p>]]></description>

<div style="font-family: Arial; font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Des Bishop met me in a park in Beijing to tell me all about China. Des is a comic from Ireland by way of New York and he moved to Beijing a couple of years ago to learn Mandarin to try to do standup for Chinese people. He came as an outsider and after almost 2 years there, he's made quite a few observations about the country and about Beijing in particular. What a cool thing about podcasts that I can record these with minimal effort on the other side of the planet. Dave Smith joins me for the intro and outro.</span></div>

I should've gotten more into what their feelings were heading into each round but I didn't because I'm sometimes a bad interviewer. Regardless, enjoy.</p>]]></description>

He's the only guy I know, know who's gotten to direct an actual Hollywood movie. It's pretty cool. We covered that and our meanderings (that's a word now) took us to standup, Occupy Wall Street, and a bunch of other places. There was a little chunk in the middle that I had to cut out because I ended up mentioning some private information about one of my buddies that I realized I shouldn't have mentioned. It wasn't even anything funny or interesting so I didn't mind dropping it out anyway</span></p>]]></description>

I really wanted to get into the feeling of grief that comes with loss but I'm so intrigued by suicide that I just ended up wanted to know all the details leading up to her friend, Chris, taking his own life. This is a serious subject but I treat it with the same lighthearted inquisitiveness that I treat any other subject. I hate getting caught up feeling the same emotions as the subject. So, while I have a general respect for suicide, I don't let the idea of it make me sad. So with that in mind, please enjoy this really interesting conversation with someone who just lost a friend.</p>]]></description>

I’ve known him for nearly as long as I’ve been in Los Angeles. I didn’t quite realize how long it had been until we started talking. Man, there were some great times had while we were coming up. Steve is one of the funniest guys I know and he’s also one of the nicest. The fact that he’s not a household name is a sign that there is no justice in the world. But at least it led to some good stories about life on the lower end of the standup totem pole. I hope you enjoy it. I think too often there’s talk of how a particular entertainer made it in Hollywood and there’s never enough attention called to the survival years where you’re just trying to get by while you’re chasing your dreams. We got a lot of those stories in here. Enjoy.</span></p>]]></description>
