The later it gets the p’s, the more obvious it becomes that – for the first time in 4 years/200+ episodes – our guest is NOT going to show up, without warning, and live. Vicky’s question on Mailman etiquette brings Gareth back to his childhood. We discuss what Sam feels is a problem on the show – and it’s probably not what you'd think! Hot Chocolate, Flavor of Love, I Love New York &amp; Postman Pat! Look, there’s some controversy when we analyze Lindsay Lohan’s Sex List. #InuitBlock #MailmanYes #MailmanNo</itunes:summary>

      <description>Gareth &amp; Vicky host while Sam’s on the road, and start by strategizing a way to force Gabe &amp; Bunny Fever to work together again. We take you behind the scenes of our important business meeting. Tom Hensley, Darcy Staniforth &amp; Eric Person join us in Playboy Studios to talk Score Bored – their movie soundtrack podcast! We discuss the significant role music plays in film, and our personal favorites. Tom &amp; Eric talk about being Arnold Schwarzenegger’s webmasters. Darcy talks about collecting action figures and the public’s changed perception of nerds. We take TV commercials too literally - take that, Rock &amp; Noel! Eric drops a cast dating history bombshell by revealing how they’re the Fleetwood Mac of podcasts. Gareth pitches Ghost Fuckers and Re-Score Your Lives. We’re getting our information publicly sourced and basing our lives on Twitter, and it's Bane endorsed! Where would rock? Toto’s IN! I just talked to them!</description>

Sam performs his only impression of Zombie Pryor and Baron busts into Gaffigan. We reveal that comics that can sell-out theaters can have other comics killed, and what’s good about any reviews of Bill Cosby and Sarah Silverman’s specials. We compare @midnight and Failosophy and Baron talks porn stars, then seduces Gareth by singing falsetto and holding eye contact. I…was…*wait for it*…scared.</itunes:summary>

Eric Schwartz (Smooth E) joins the show and a serious discussion about Lady Gaga's ass takes place. Eric drop some rhymes and some knowledge. Did you know that T-Pain actually sounds like a white Jew? He does. Sapphire teaches Sara how to twerk. And tonight is Boys Night! Only listen is you like Snatch!</itunes:summary>

      <description>Sam, Gareth &amp; Vicky aren’t just talking to themselves – first, the “world’s filthiest punk rock band” Get Shot! calls in, and J.P. Hunter &amp; Laura Lush discuss the porn music video they shot in front of The Westboro Baptist Church. Then, buckle-up, Delraisers! Our guest is comedian, actor, musician, biker &amp; podcast host Dean Delray! Dean lays out some of his rules, including don’t murder anyone and don’t do drugs with girls. Dean talks about auditions, people’s quest for fame &amp; shortcuts, and his recent run-in with Tan Mom. Dean discusses touring with bands and comedians, and the differences in the industries. We get into Dean’s podcast Let There Be Talk (also on All Things Comedy), and his favorite episode with Robert Romanus - Fast Times at Ridgemont High’s Damone. I GOT A MOU-STAAAAAACHE!!!</description>

Our guest Scot Sothern is a writer &amp; photographer for Vice, and the author of Curb Service. Scot schools us on the history of hookers from the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s &amp; today. We talk gritty city life, Whore Tours, smoking crack, war, laws, pimps and glass-ingesting marijuana propaganda. Scot shares crazy interesting stories and his unique insight into the underworld of prostitution he’s captured through his lens for decades. His memoir, Curb Service, is available on Amazon and in bookstores everywhere.

      <description>Sam, Gareth &amp; Vicky report from the GNN (Good News Network), and talk about next week’s Laffster Live Streaming Video event! Tom Leykis joins us at Playboy Studios and talks about the evolution of the brand. The radio titan and owner of The New Normal Network lays down some Leykis 101. Tom Leykis revisits some of the touchstone relationships that shaped his life, his parent’s 40 year marriage and his 4 divorces. We make the distinction between script-optioning Asstronauts and Poindexter from the IT department, as well as a new &amp; used ’97 Lexus. Tom has Breaking News to solve the Deadbeat Dad Problem. Emotionally involved? What show is this?!</description>

      <itunes:summary>Dave Anthony co-hosts with Sam &amp; Vicky and Wil Anderson returns! We get asked why everything on the podcast is valued in hookers, and we ask why it was TOFOP but now it’s FOFOP – what changed? Wil talks about what happened in Australia that wasn’t approved of by most, bringing quantity, and a nice little Danson streak. Dave calls Great Quotes in Podcast History, and Vicky reveals Sam’s ultimate guest as Lorenzo Lamas, causing more of the backstory to unfold. Wil defends everything “free” as good and Dave wants a sister act as the Lord intended. Sam has a crazy meltdown at a press conference and Talks About the Ladies &amp; Wil talks Set List Shows and different international audiences. Our engineer Sam Zia uses his degree in sexology as Dave role plays a future patient &amp; delves into Tripoli’s fetish. Canada, UFC, Old School Rules &amp; Punch Cum - hey, we didn’t say it was sound advice – we’re just throwing it out there.

      <itunes:summary>Gareth finally returns to Sam &amp; Vicky after 2 weeks of gigs, a visit home and 2 TV appearances on Sullivan &amp; Son and Stevie TV. Dave Anthony returns to talk his appearance on Maron and his podcast lifestyle (Walking the Room, The Dollop, FOFOP, LA PodFest). We scramble for headphones before the episode's main event: SUGAR WEASEL! The Male Clown Escort! Sugar Weasel takes us on a journey from screening his clientele, using banana flavored condoms and having an absurdly huge penis. Sam Stripoli talks about his days as Maverick dancing with Chocolate Thunder. We got a loose weasel just dropping his sugar all over the place and it's getting Dave-gerous!!!
