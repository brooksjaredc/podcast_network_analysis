		<description><![CDATA[Legion of Skanks has been called "the most offensive podcast on Earth" and the hosts and creators wouldn't want it any other way! Stand up comedians and real-life best friends Big Jay Oakerson, Luis J. Gomez, and Dave Smith host their weekly "podcast party" from the Creek and Cave in Long Island City where they invite their loyal fans in studio to hang out and listen in as they discuss anything and everything in a hilarious and extremely uncensored way. The "skanks" consistently raise the bar on filth and depravity. The goal of the show isn't to educate, but rather to make you piss your pants laughing and possibly question your own moral code. 
The latest 10 episodes are always free, but if you want access to all the archives, watch live, chat live, access to the forums, and get the show a week before it comes out everywhere else - you can subscribe now at gasdigitalnetwork.com and use the code LOS to save 15% on the entire network, plus get a discount code on all merchandise!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedians Big Jay Oakerson, Luis J. Gomez, and Dave Smith host Legion of Skanks Podcast! On this week's show, Jay shares a story about getting emotional in a cab while listening to music, and breaks down the lyrics to 'Cats In The Cradle' for Luis. The Skanks discuss a YouTube channel called "Queer Kids Stuff", which aims to explain LGBTQ+ issues to children ages three to five. The boys discuss ElsaGate, and go down an internet rabbit hole that ends with exploitive child bathtub videos. We revisit the issue of getting f**ked by a horse, supplying a visual reference for our studio audience. With a slew of interesting stuff popping up on Jay's morning journey through WorldStar Hiphop– the Skanks take another look at the world of Black Catfishing, react to yet another instance of mall security guards gone violent, as well as a prayer circle comprised solely of strippers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedians Big Jay Oakerson, Luis J. Gomez, and Dave Smith celebrate a milestone episode of Legion of Skanks! The boys offer their reviews of Black Panther, and describe a confrontation they got into at the movies when they went to see it. Luis argues for how technology has changed the game when it comes to having sexual encounters in taxi cabs. After spending the weekend doing shows at the Palisades Mall, the Skanks discuss their experience determining which of the mall’s two escape rooms would have provided a more exciting way to kill their spare time. The president of the Philippines has banned the use of condoms, and the Skanks take this news as an opportunity to learn a little about the statistical odds of catching AIDS in varying circumstances.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comedians Big Jay Oakerson, Luis J. Gomez, and Dave Smith celebrate a milestone episode of Legion of Skanks! The boys offer their reviews of Black Panther, and describe a confrontation they got into at the movies when they went to see it. Luis argues for how technology has changed the game when it comes to having sexual encounters in taxi cabs. After spending the weekend doing shows at the Palisades Mall, the Skanks discuss their experience determining which of the mall’s two escape rooms would have provided a more exciting way to kill their spare time. The president of the Philippines has banned the use of condoms, and the Skanks take this news as an opportunity to learn a little about the statistical odds of catching AIDS in varying circumstances.
