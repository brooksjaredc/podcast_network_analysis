			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bruce Damer is a Canadian-American multi-disciplinary scientist, designer, and author. He collaborates with colleagues developing and testing a new model for the origin of life on Earth and in the design of spacecraft architectures to provide a viable path for expansion of human civilization beyond the Earth. He began his career in the 1980s developing some of the earliest user interfaces for personal computers, led a community in the 1990s bringing the first multi-user virtual worlds to the Internet, and since 2000 supported NASA and the space industry on numerous simulations and spacecraft designs. He has spent 25 years chronicling the history of computing in his DigiBarn Computer Museum and curates archives of counterculture figures such as Dr. Timothy Leary, Terence McKenna and others. He currently serves as Principal Scientist at DigitalSpace; Associate Researcher in the Department of Biomolecular Engineering at UC Santa Cruz; Associate of the NASA Astrobiology Center; Member of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life, and Founding Director of the Contact Consortium. He also served as Visiting Scholar at the University of Washington and as a member of the Faculty at Charles University, Prague.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kyle Thiermann is a professional big wave surfer, Patagonia surf ambassador, documentarian, journalist, and pal of mine. We took a drive down to Baja to get some work done and hang out.</p> <p>As a correspondent for Discovery Digital Networks, Kyle Thiermann covered important issues ranging from a little-known indigenous conflict in Southern Chile, to the impact wild pigs have on Hawaii's coral reefs.<br /> <br /> Thiermann's surfing skills earned him a spot among an elite group of athletes as a Patagonia Surf Ambassador. With Patagonia’s support, Thiermann created and hosted the award-winning documentary series, Surfing For Change. The series included stories about the Indonesia trash epidemic, Hawaii’s Monsanto protests, and the adverse impacts of surf tourism in Nicaragua.<br /> <br /> Thiermann speaks at universities throughout the country and in 2011 gave a TEDx talk in his wetsuit. His surfing and journalistic successes have earned him Surfrider’s Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award, the Brower Youth Award, the American Clean Skies Film Award, and the Peter Benchley Blue Vision Award.<br /> <br /> Thiermann has spent years becoming an expert in the ocean and is an alternate in the prestigious annual big-wave event at Mavericks. He hosts a weekly podcast that explores subjects that include psychedelics, sex, and surfing.  <br /> <br /> Website link: <a href="http://www.kyle.surf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=http://www.kyle.surf/&source=gmail&ust=1514394274406000&usg=AFQjCNGQnS37AyiRwnQhaOd2icdSngonIA">http://www.kyle.surf/</a><br />  <br /> Video Links:</p> <div> </div> <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsMuY9rRVB8" target= "_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DCsMuY9rRVB8&source=gmail&ust=1514394274407000&usg=AFQjCNGqAwubYVphLYxJcc72MFdru9DSzg"> Chasing Mavericks In Real Life </a><br /> <br /> <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=330&v=sJJ_9UEX86k" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue%3D330%26v%3DsJJ_9UEX86k&source=gmail&ust=1514394274407000&usg=AFQjCNF1an9rXjTmYORwnMlYixCP_tJwcg"> Chile's 500-Year Secret Conflict </a><br /> <br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWReNk99IWc" target= "_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl= "https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWWReNk99IWc&source=gmail&ust=1514394274407000&usg=AFQjCNHSxmNDxFsYGx_8I4bMWucFV11wCQ"> Who Is Kyle Thiermann? </a></div>]]></description>

<p>Gray is a well-known critic of our standard educational system who is frequently invited to speak to groups of parents, educators, and researchers about children’s needs for free play, the psychological damage inflicted on children through our present methods of schooling, and the ways in which children are designed, by natural selection, to control their own education. Along with a group of other concerned citizens, he has created a website, AlternativesToSchool.com, aimed at helping families find alternative, more natural, routes to education.

He believes that anthropology holds important current-day lessons: “The macroscopic perspective of anthropology, with its expansive time frame and culturally comparative orientation, provides unique insights into the nature of war and holds some concrete lessons for how to develop a more safe and peaceful world.” </p>
<p>Fry’s most recent edited book is titled <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Peace-Human-Nature-Evolutionary/dp/0190232463/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=1-1&qid=1417647459" target="_blank">War, Peace and Human Nature</a> </em>(Oxford, 2013)and contains 27 chapters by leaders in the fields of biology, primatology, forager studies, peace studies, psychology, and social cultural anthropology. His previous book,<em> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beyond-War-Human-Potential-Peace/dp/019538461X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1417647376&sr=8-2&keywords=beyond+war" target="_blank">Beyond War: The Human Potential for Peace</a></em>, is a fantastic introduction to this material for non-specialist readers.</p>
