			<description>Join us this Christmas as we discuss one of the worst holiday-themed movies to come out two months after December, Reindeer Games. We talk about terrible open-mouthed kissing, how much Ben Affleck likes pecan pie, and a strange cameo by Ashton Kutcher. Also, we learn all about Paul’s intimate relationship history with his mom. Joining us this week is Who Charted’s Howard Kremer who helps us learn about symbolism and what the holidays really mean. There are no reindeer games here! Happy holidays from How Did This Get Made!</description>

			<description>We&apos;re very fortunate to have two experts this week joining us to discuss The Room. First off we have Steve Heisler from The AV Club who has made it his journalistic duty to learn everything he can about this disaster. Also joining us is Mark (Oh, hi Mark!), aka Greg Sestero who also worked behind-the-scenes as a producer. Tuxedo football, outdoor green screens, unnecessary double casting, Mark knows how it all came to be and he&apos;s here to share it all with us. Enjoy!</description>
