On this episode we explore our biggest failures in life and the power they have had on our experiences, how psychedelics help us create massive breakthroughs, and why we seems to overlook the environmental impacts of our actions. I loved this conversation and I think you will too.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">To learn more about Kyle, check out <a href="http://www.kyle.surf/"><span class= "s2">kyle.surf</span></a> and <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kyle-thiermann-show/id1170975976?mt=2"> <span class="s2">The Kyle Thiermann Show</span></a>.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, check out his complete bio here if you want to impressed with another human:</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kyle Thiermann, born 1990, is a professional surfer and filmmaker from Santa Cruz, CA.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he's not chasing building-sized waves around the globe he works with Discovery Digital Networks as an on-camera correspondent and producer. He also works closely with his main sponsor, Patagonia to beat up products and help implement solutions to the environmental crisis.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">From ages 18-25 Kyle created and hosted the YouTube series Surfing For Change. While traveling to the best waves around the world, Thiermann created gonzo-style mini-documentaries about current environmental issues happening in the regions. In the series, Thiermann focused on the power people have to create a better world through everyday decisions.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">His first YouTube video in the series details how money kept in multinational banks can be used to finance destructive projects all over the world. This video inspired people to move over $360 million dollars of lending power out of centralized banks and into local banks and credit unions, and reached people throughout North America, South America, Africa and much of Europe.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kyle has covered controversial stories all over the world. These stories have included the Indonesian trash epidemic, GMO protests in Hawaii, working conditions in Sri Lanka, nuclear power in South Africa, and the adverse effects of surf tourism in Nicaragua.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He graduated from Gaia University with a Bachelors of Science in Green Business with a focus in Media. His surfing skills earned him a spot among an elite group of athletes on the teams of Patagonia and Sector 9.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kyle frequently appears on the pages of publications such as Surfer Magazine, Outside Magazine, and is a contributing writer for The Inertia and Santa Cruz Waves.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kyle Speaks at Universities throughout the country and in 2011 gave a TEDx Talk in his wetsuit. Kyle’s surfing and filmmaking successes have earned him the Brower Youth Award, American Clean Skies Award, Blue Vision Youth Award, and Surfrider’s Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award</span></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">---</span></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">To support Pleasure Monkey Nation, check out the <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/pleasuremonkey"><span class="s2">Patreon Page</span></a> and show sponsors to get some sweet discounts:</span></p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><span class="s2"><a href= "https://www.onnit.com/monkey/">ONNIT.com/MONKEY</a></span> <span class="s1">for 10% off all ONNIT supplements and gear.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Kyle Thiermann is a professional surfer, documentary filmmaker, TEDx speaker, and podcast host with one hell of a life journey and a knack for sharing it with others. On this episode we explore our biggest failures in life and the power they have had on our experiences, how psychedelics help us create massive breakthroughs, and why we seems to overlook the environmental impacts of our actions. I loved this conversation and I think you will too.</p> <p class="p1">To learn more about Kyle, check out <a href="http://www.kyle.surf/">kyle.surf</a> and <a href= "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-kyle-thiermann-show/id1170975976?mt=2"> The Kyle Thiermann Show</a>.</p> <p class="p1">Also, check out his complete bio here if you want to impressed with another human:</p> <p class="p1">Kyle Thiermann, born 1990, is a professional surfer and filmmaker from Santa Cruz, CA.</p> <p class="p1">When he's not chasing building-sized waves around the globe he works with Discovery Digital Networks as an on-camera correspondent and producer. He also works closely with his main sponsor, Patagonia to beat up products and help implement solutions to the environmental crisis.</p> <p class="p1">From ages 18-25 Kyle created and hosted the YouTube series Surfing For Change. While traveling to the best waves around the world, Thiermann created gonzo-style mini-documentaries about current environmental issues happening in the regions. In the series, Thiermann focused on the power people have to create a better world through everyday decisions.</p> <p class="p1">His first YouTube video in the series details how money kept in multinational banks can be used to finance destructive projects all over the world. This video inspired people to move over $360 million dollars of lending power out of centralized banks and into local banks and credit unions, and reached people throughout North America, South America, Africa and much of Europe.</p> <p class="p1">Kyle has covered controversial stories all over the world. These stories have included the Indonesian trash epidemic, GMO protests in Hawaii, working conditions in Sri Lanka, nuclear power in South Africa, and the adverse effects of surf tourism in Nicaragua.</p> <p class="p1">He graduated from Gaia University with a Bachelors of Science in Green Business with a focus in Media. His surfing skills earned him a spot among an elite group of athletes on the teams of Patagonia and Sector 9.</p> <p class="p1">Kyle frequently appears on the pages of publications such as Surfer Magazine, Outside Magazine, and is a contributing writer for The Inertia and Santa Cruz Waves.</p> <p class="p1">Kyle Speaks at Universities throughout the country and in 2011 gave a TEDx Talk in his wetsuit. Kyle’s surfing and filmmaking successes have earned him the Brower Youth Award, American Clean Skies Award, Blue Vision Youth Award, and Surfrider’s Pro Surfer Environmental Achievement Award</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">---</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">To support Pleasure Monkey Nation, check out the <a href= "https://www.patreon.com/pleasuremonkey">Patreon Page</a> and show sponsors to get some sweet discounts:</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1"><a href= "https://www.onnit.com/monkey/">ONNIT.com/MONKEY</a> for 10% off all ONNIT supplements and gear.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On this episode we are hanging out with Jill Coleman, Danny Johnson, and Aaron Alexander talking shame, being present, expectations, and romantic energy. We all circled up around Jill’s living room with a few glasses of wine and let loose. This might be my favorite podcast yet… Enjoy :)</p> <p>You can find them at;</p> <p>Aligntherapy.com</p> <p>JillFit.com</p> <p>DannyJ.com</p> <p> </p> <p>A little bit about these beautiful badasses:</p> <p>Aaron Alexander has been professionally working with clients of all ages seeking a variety of goals from pain relief to improved athletic performance for over 10 years. He is currently seeing clients at his office, Align Therapy, in downtown Bend, Oregon. Aaron began the journey as a nationally certified personal trainer specializing in corrective exercise and nutrition consultation. During that time Aaron studied psychology at the University of Hawaii. Soon after, he evolved into becoming a licensed manual therapist studying myofascial release, neuromuscular therapy and trigger point therapy at Maui School of Therapeutic Massage. A fascination with connective tissue lead him to study structural integration at the Rolf Institute in Boulder, CO. Being a LMT and CPT on top of a Rolf Structural Integration Practitioner, Aaron has a strong understanding of the intricacies of the body and mind.</p> <p> </p> <p>Danny Johnson, is a high-energy speaker who can dish it to you straight, but with just enough sugar to make you want more.
