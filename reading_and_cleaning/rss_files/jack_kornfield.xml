      <title>Ep. 47 - Nobility and Love</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this episode of Heart Wisdom, Jack talks about leadership, nobility, and love. American presidents George Washington and Lincoln are used as examples of men who showed true nobility of heart. There is a sense of justice in their words and a kind of integrity to their actions in the midst of unbearable suffering, which is a sign of real leadership. This is a quality of nobility which we can find ourselves in our own roles as leaders. The Buddha says that wise leadership requires generosity, integrity, peace, and sacrifice among many other traits. These are all qualities that can be awakened in us. This is why we are given the practices of compassion, mindfulness, and equanimity. Jack teaches us to utilize these practices in an effort to awaken our inner nobility. Jack also discusses the diversity of love and its many roles. Love brings happiness, heals, and even teaches through loss. We explore a few ways in which love can present itself and affect our lives.  ]]>

      <title>Ep. 46 – The Stories We Tell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jack’s timeless wisdom leads the way as he responds to a handful of questions concerning some of the common struggles encountered on the human plane. How can we be present with difficult situations without indulging the emotions? The problem often lies more in the narratives we tell about ourselves and others that perpetuate the suffering. We must be willing to allow the energies of life to rise and fall as they do, all the while expanding our capacity to feel without necessarily believing the storyline, which is often biased and untrue to begin with. In learning to be with our emotions we are better able to respond from a place of wisdom rather than an expectation of how it should be. Taking time to recognize the distinction between wise and unskillful desire is a practical and effective method for addressing the root causes for much of our suffering. Through examining our impulses, we gain the perspective necessary to determine if the associated actions will ultimately increase our joy or our sorrow. Jack reminds us that we don’t need to get rid of anything, we just have to remember who we really are and operate from that deeper self. The seeds we plant in the garden of the heart are not separate from us in their origin or their blossoming.]]>

In coming to rest in the space of calm and kind attention that grows in meditation, we learn to listen with the heart and move with the inspired energy that follows.]]>

      <title>Ep. 44 - Attachment Revealed</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[To create and maintain appropriate boundaries we must first understand what it is as we are approaching attachment, commitment and love. Jack offers a definition and reinterpretation of attachment to represent more compassionate qualities such as commitment, dedication and wise ambition. He encourages us to be present without the need to control, to show up but not be focused on the outcome. We learn to step back and listen to the world as a means of witnessing the play of life. Our opening will present itself, but only when our perspective is wide enough to discover the full range of potential.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jack offers up several stories to emphasize the ways in which mindfulness consistently returns us to a radical capacity for presence that can truly change our lives for the better. The natural freedom revealed through the quality of compassionate awareness is itself an act of respect.

The reality of the present is all there is, and in fully embodying this understanding we move into an open and spacious realm of creative insight and joyful expression. Finding what it is that brings us to life, moves us deeper into the Dharma and sharing that energy with the world is a profound statement.

      <title>Ep. 26 - When Love Meets Sorrow</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[“When Love meets sorrow it becomes compassion”
As we become silent we start to awaken to the mystery of this human realm. We begin to open to and acknowledge all of the unfinished business that often permeates our being. Through practice we can learn to offer love in the presence of pain. In these moments of loving-kindness we feel a connection to the web of life and discover the more objective nature of our struggles and sorrows. As Jack explains, no matter what level you are practicing on, you cannot fully open without compassion.]]>

      <title>Ep. 24 - Gates of Awakening</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A spacious walk through the shifts of identity that often occur as we move from the smaller sense of self into that place of loving awareness, the ‘one who knows’. This opening can be understood as the entrance point to Awakening. Though it may be unfamiliar and often times uncomfortable, it is ultimately necessary for moving beyond the limitations of the separate self. Jack provides us with a map for this new territory, and reassures us that the intelligence of the heart will lead the way, even through the darkest corridors.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Spiritual practice requires of us a kind and devoted attention to the opening of the body as well as the heart. We cultivate the necessary space through a quieting of the mind, and invite a sense of compassion and openness into the heart. We can then listen to better understand how to become ourselves what we want the world to be. There is a profound offering in our commitment and dedication to becoming the most beautiful human beings that we can be. At the root of this offering is the desire to allow spiritual practice to be the tool with which we tend to the garden of the heart.]]>

But what circumstances must arise in order for us to honor our particular incarnation, and to then do something beautiful with it? Crisis, trauma, and retreat are just a few of the potential catalysts, and our task is to simply recognize and accept that which has served to encourage our own efforts along the path. We begin to see that it is often just a matter of remembering and reminding ourselves of the different ways that we are brought to freedom and joy in our own lives.]]>

      <title>Ep. 8 - Transforming Darkness</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In attempting to draw light into our lives, we inevitably encounter the intrinsic darkness that surrounds our existence. Our task, as honorable beings, is to avoid letting the ignorant darkness take over our hearts, while simultaneously not averting our gaze. In meditation, we confront the full spectrum of experience, acknowledging these darker forces, and discovering the capacity to respond from a place of loving awareness. It will require the courage to act, but as the Buddha said, “If you can learn to dwell in your heart, offering love to all beings, that will be protection wherever you go’.
Episode Outline:
• 2 Kinds of Darkness - Fertile (From which all things arise - contains the potential of creation) and Blind/Unconscious (Operates below our basic level of awareness, often requires uncovering/recognition)
• Practice - When we honor our meditation practice, we see everything - the full spectrum of our experience
• Our Task - As honorable beings, we mustn’t let the outer (ignorant) darkness consume our hearts, while, simultaneously, not averting our eyes.
• Violence - Has almost always been a part of our culture - What are the causes and conditions that create these negative aspects? We have to mourn tragedy, but also stand up for a different world. The darkness must be met with an equal force of love and courage
• Dwell in the Heart - Never cease to offer love to all beings]]>

• 2 Kinds of Darkness - Fertile (From which all things arise - contains the potential of creation) and Blind/Unconscious (Operates below our basic level of awareness, often requires uncovering/recognition)
• Practice - When we honor our meditation practice, we see everything - the full spectrum of our experience
• Our Task - As honorable beings, we mustn’t let the outer (ignorant) darkness consume our hearts, while, simultaneously, not averting our eyes.
• Violence - Has almost always been a part of our culture - What are the causes and conditions that create these negative aspects? We have to mourn tragedy, but also stand up for a different world. The darkness must be met with an equal force of love and courage
• Dwell in the Heart - Never cease to offer love to all beings</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[In attempting to draw light into our lives, we inevitably encounter the intrinsic darkness that surrounds our existence. Our task, as honorable beings, is to avoid letting the ignorant darkness take over our hearts, while simultaneously not averting our gaze. In meditation, we confront the full spectrum of experience, acknowledging these darker forces, and discovering the capacity to respond from a place of loving awareness. It will require the courage to act, but as the Buddha said, “If you can learn to dwell in your heart, offering love to all beings, that will be protection wherever you go’.

        <![CDATA[Trauma comes in all shapes and sizes, and as human beings we are all vulnerable to its potential effects. But how can we meet trauma with tenderness and courage? Healing is so often a precursor to the practice of liberation itself, but true release requires a familiarity with emotions and the capacity to be present for them. Through mindfulness we can develop the compassion necessary to approach our traumas. When we can first bare it, we then have a choice of what to do with it. Once our story can be told it often loses its hold.]]>

Meditation isn’t necessarily about having a mystical experience, but about coming back into the natural mysterious experience of being alive. Within all of us there is a divine seed of consciousness, much greater than the functional matter that we occupy. In meditation, we are invited to return to this sacred space.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[One of the most important tools for navigating through our complicated existence is the understanding of Karma. We consistently create patterns in our lives but often fail to see the cause and effect relationship that unfolds. Karma speaks to the way in which we respond to that which comes to us, to the life that we are given. It’s not the action but the intention that is the source of karma. Through meditation we expose the patterns that we create for ourselves. By tending to our hearts we discover a deeper motivation for our being. It is from this place that we learn to plant our seeds of intention, and the seeds we plant become how are lives are lived.]]>
