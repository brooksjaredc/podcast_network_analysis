			<description><![CDATA[<p>It's not often you have a living legend on the podcast and Yakov Smirnoff is most definitely that. With seven appearances on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, a huge commercial break with Miller Lite and the many ups and downs of trying to make it as a stand up comedian in America as a Russian who doesn't speak English! Nothing would ever have gotten in his way and he shares the roller coaster he has lived. But no story in this episode captures the spirit of Yakov like his story after 9/11. This is such a great episode and a must listen and share!</p> <p>This episode is brought to you by Brooklinen, the fastest growing bedding brand in the world! You spend 1/3 of your life in your sheets, why not do that in comfort and for fractions of the price. Brooklinen make the highest quality sheets with no big mark up. We love our sheets and we know you will too. And right now all of our listeners can get $20 off and free shipping by going to Brooklinen.com and using promo code CRAB.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Life happens in moments. Like when you parents looked across set of Family Feud and realized they were going to be together. Or when you rigged a rain maker to the top of your new house in order to secure the love of your life. But this week's guest, comedian Hunter Hill will be remembered for his bravery on this week's episode. Not for his actions during the recent mudslides in Ventura but for his willingness to share his traumatic experience with us and allow us to find the humor in such a devastating situation. We always say on this podcast that when guests share their vulnerabilities or traumatic experiences, it offers relief to people out there listening that may have been through their own tragedies. This is such a great episode, please listen and share with friends.</p> <p>http://TheCrabFeast.com<br /> #FTCF *****</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life happens in moments. Like when you parents looked across set of Family Feud and realized they were going to be together. Or when you rigged a rain maker to the top of your new house in order to secure the love of your life. But this week's guest, comedian Hunter Hill will be remembered for his bravery on this week's episode. Not for his actions during the recent mudslides in Ventura but for his willingness to share his traumatic experience with us and allow us to find the humor in such a devastating situation. We always say on this podcast that when guests share their vulnerabilities or traumatic experiences, it offers relief to people out there listening that may have been through their own tragedies. This is such a great episode, please listen and share with friends.</p> <p>http://TheCrabFeast.com #FTCF *****</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Imagine if Doogie Howser's Dad was your Dad? Well Andrew didn't have to because he was!!! Growing up around movie sets inspired him to be a stunt man, but only as a hobby, so you know like falling out of windows as a gag, or falling down stairs to impress ladies. No matter what, Andrew is a magnet to uniqueness. Whether he's grabbing a ride from James Gandolfini after late night poker or crashing his car into Dennis Franz's tree, he is always in the right place at the right time!<br /> <br /> http://TheCrabFeast.com<br /> #FTCF *****</p>]]></description>
