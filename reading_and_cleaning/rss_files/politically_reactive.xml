        <![CDATA[<p>What do you do when a Twitter beef disrupts your plans? That’s what happened to this week’s Politically Re-Active. But don’t you worry. We’re picking up the pieces and bringing you the good, bad, and ugly of today’s digital age.

She is also among the founders of the emerging field of digital sociology. We’ll also speak to cyber security expert Nicholas Weaver about whether or not we need to worry about anyone spying on our boring lives and if so, who that might be.

      <title>Janet Mock on Surpassing Certainty</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[She’s spoken at the Women’s March on Washington, hosted a show for MSNBC, edited for Allure and Marie Claire, and written a New York Times bestselling memoir – and that’s not even half of the revolutionary work that trans writer and activist Janet Mock has done in her young career. In this episode, we talk with Janet about the writing process for her latest memoir  “Surpassing Certainty,” the strong history and community of trans people in her native Hawaii, why the term “passing” is problematic for her, and why we should complicate our language when we use the word “woman”. For those of you who don’t know Janet: You’re about to become fans!

      <title>Naomi Klein Says "No Is Not Enough"</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It usually takes Naomi Klein five years to write a book. This time, it took her less than five months. The journalist, author, and activist’s latest work _No Is Not Enough_ is all about Trump, the dark trends that have led to his presidency, and the urgent need for intersectional action right now – not later. In this episode of Politically Re-Active, we dig into the “capitalist burlesque” that has taken over the White House and explain how Trump’s scandals only reinforce his corporate brand (“impunity through wealth”). With so many crises unfolding around the globe, Naomi says, it’s time to band together to revive our own idea of utopia. So tweet us yours: @politicreactive.

      <title>Jill Filipovic on the Feminist Pursuit of Happiness</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Writer Jill Filipovic on the feminist pursuit of happiness
 
Imagine a world in which women weren’t forced to struggle for equality in a system rigged against them. Imagine instead, the ideal world of journalist and author Jill Filipovic – one in which happiness for women is the driving force behind policies like fair pay and legal recognition of best friendships. In that world, Jill says, not only are women happier and healthier, but most everyone else (read: people who aren’t white men) are better off, too. In this episode of Politically Re-Active, your favorite hosts sit down with Jill to talk about her policy ideas as well as Ivanka Trump’s brand of “empowerment”, white lady feminism, and the evil of the all-male photo op. 
 
Follow Jill on Twitter!: @JillFilipovic. And read more about _The H-Spot_ here: https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jill-filipovic/the-h-spot/9781568585482/
 
We have TWO live shows this week! Join us in-person at the Limestone Comedy Festival in Bloomington, Indiana, this Friday, June 2nd: http://www.limestonefest.com/. Or if you’re in San Francisco, head over to the Comedy Central Colossal Clusterfest on Sunday, June 4th: https://www.clusterfest.com/.

      <title>Rashad Robinson &amp; Color of Change Cancels Bill O'Reilly</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Rashad Robinson has done battle with Bill O’Reilly and won – twice. He’s taken on the shady, corporate-driven conservative operation ALEC and gotten companies like Coca Cola and Walmart to back down from supporting stand-your-ground laws. And now, after successfully campaigning to remove O’Reilly from Fox News - along with
great work from UltraViolet, the Women's March, NOW-New York, CREDO, Sleeping Giants, and MoveOn - he’s taking on the prison-profiteering bail bond industry – and it’s not even June. As executive director of Color of Change, the nation's largest online racial justice organization, Rashad is at the forefront of the strategic campaigns that transform lives and movements. In this episode of Politically Re-Active, he shares the backstories behind these campaigns, the role of entertainment in the resistance, and more. Trust us – you won’t want to miss it!
 
Please visit Color of Change to learn how you can support their campaigns, especially their current campaign to reform the bail bond industry: https://www.colorofchange.org/. And follow Rashad on Twitter: @rashadrobinson.
 
Get in the head of one of your favorite hosts! Kamau’s book  “The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell” is available on Amazon. You can find a link as well as dates for his book tour at http://www.wkamaubell.com/. Hari also really, really wants you to listen to his albums and come to his shows. Do it!

      <title>Getting Adversarial with Journalist Jeremy Scahill</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Folks on both the left and the right have a love-hate relationship with reporter and Intercept co-founder Jeremy Scahill. His brand of “adversarial” investigative journalism makes no exceptions – not for the nation’s most powerful, and especially not for those advocating for wars abroad. In this episode of #politicallyreactive, we talk with Jeremy about his refusal to sit on a panel with Milo Yiannopoulos on Real Time with Bill Maher, what it was like to interview Julian Assange for the Intercepted podcast, his thoughts on Russian involvement in U.S. politics, and the people who give him hope for the future (hint: it’s probably you!). Click “play” to find out why Jeremy has earned the title, “one-man truth squad”. 

Keep tabs on Jeremy on Twitter (@jeremyscahill) and subscribe to the Intercepted podcast on your preferred podcast platform! Or stream the show online at: https://theintercept.com/podcasts/

      <itunes:summary>Folks on both the left and the right have a love-hate relationship with reporter and Intercept co-founder Jeremy Scahill. His brand of “adversarial” investigative journalism makes no exceptions – not for the nation’s most powerful, and especially not for those advocating for wars abroad. In this episode of #politicallyreactive, we talk with Jeremy about his refusal to sit on a panel with Milo Yiannopoulos on Real Time with Bill Maher, what it was like to interview Julian Assange for the Intercepted podcast, his thoughts on Russian involvement in U.S. politics, and the people who give him hope for the future (hint: it’s probably you!). Click “play” to find out why Jeremy has earned the title, “one-man truth squad”. 

Keep tabs on Jeremy on Twitter (@jeremyscahill) and subscribe to the Intercepted podcast on your preferred podcast platform! Or stream the show online at: https://theintercept.com/podcasts/

Book tours, TV shows, standup – oh my! Catch Kamau in-person for his The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell book tour or on TV for CNN’s United Shades of America! More info at http://www.wkamaubell.com/. And Hari really, REALLY wants you to come see him on tour – find dates at: http://www.harikondabolu.com/.

      <title>Aasif Mandvi on the Gaslighting Presidency</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[You probably got to know him as the “Senior Middle East Correspondent,” or the “Senior Muslim Correspondent,” or maybe the “Senior Foreign Looking Correspondent”, but actor, writer, and former Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi has moved into the hot seat for this episode of Politically Re-Active. Join Aasif and your favorite hosts as they talk about political satire during the Bush years, Aasif’s reaction to the Muslim ban and the “gaslighting presidency”, and what it means to “wrestle your inner Hitler to the ground”.

Keep up to date with Aasif on Twitter: @aasif. That’s also where you’ll find a link to learn more about his memoir _No Land’s Man_, which the New York Times calls “explosively funny”.  

Kamau’s also got a book coming out! _The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell_ is available for pre-order on Amazon. If you’d like to hear his awkward thoughts in person, you can meet him on his book tour. Visit http://www.wkamaubell.com/ to learn more. And if you STILL can’t get enough Kamau, watch him on the season premiere of United Shades of America, which returns to CNN on April 30th! 

Hari is ALSO on tour, and he wants you to show up, Midwest fans! Tour dates are at his website: http://www.harikondabolu.com/. 

Keep telling us what you think of the show! We’re on Twitter: @politicreactive. Or if you want to wax poetic, shoot us an email: politicallyreactive@firstlook.org. ]]>

      <title>Journalist Alia Malek on What We're Missing When We Talk About About Syria</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s been six years of the devastating civil war in Syria – more than 11 million people have been displaced, and last week’s horrifying chemical attack on Syrian citizens by their own president Bashar al-Assad has been yet another reminder of the human cost of the conflict. On this episode of Politically Re-Active, journalist and author Alia Malek helps contextualize the war and shares her own experiences of living in Damascus during the start of the conflict. Alia recommends following these outlets and journalists to stay engaged with news from Syria: independent journalist Rania Abouzeid (@Raniaab), Kareem Shaheen of The Guardian (@kshaheen), and the website http://syria.jadaliyya.com/. And if you have money to spare, donate to the following organizations: INARA, which focuses on providing medical assistance to children from Syria, and Chicago-based Karam, which seeks to “restore the dignity and quality of life for people affected by conflict.”

Learn more about Alia and her book, The Home That Was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria, at www.aliamalek.com/.

      <title>Patrisse Khan-Cullors on Black Lives Matter &amp; Resistance under 45</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kick off Season 2 with your favorite hosts and grassroots organizer, resistance fighter, and #blacklivesmatter co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors! We dig into why Patrisse identifies as an organizer and not an activist, what it was like to see #blacklivesmatter go viral, and the fear – and courage – that goes along with being viewed as an enemy of the state. There’s no other person we’d rather laugh and resist with than Patrisse – and you.

Follow Patrisse on Twitter: @osope. You can also learn more about her fight against police brutality at http://patrissecullors.com/. And of course, get involved with #blacklivesmatter – chapter information is available at http://blacklivesmatter.com/.

And meet your hosts! Both Kamau and Hari are going on tour – find out when they’ll be in your city at www.harikondabolu.com and www.wkamaubell.com. If you can’t wait until then, you can always listen to Hari’s new record “Hari Kondabolu’s New Material Night Volume I” on Bandcamp and iTunes. Or you can watch Kamau on CNN’s “United Shades of America” beginning in late April.

Follow Patrisse on Twitter: @osope. You can also learn more about her fight against police brutality at http://patrissecullors.com/. And of course, get involved with #blacklivesmatter – chapter information is available at http://blacklivesmatter.com/.

And meet your hosts! Both Kamau and Hari are going on tour – find out when they’ll be in your city at www.harikondabolu.com and www.wkamaubell.com. If you can’t wait until then, you can always listen to Hari’s new record “Hari Kondabolu’s New Material Night Volume I” on Bandcamp and iTunes. Or you can watch Kamau on CNN’s “United Shades of America” beginning in late April. 

As always, send us your thoughts and suggestions on Twitter and over email: @politicreactive or politicallyreactive@firstlook.org.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hip-hop activist, journalist, and community organizer Rosa Clemente has a few good reasons why she doesn’t rock with the Dems.

The activist also responds to accusations that he’s white (he’s not) and reflects on why he identifies with his friend, Colin Kaepernick.

      <title>David Daley on How Republicans Ratf**ked American Democracy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[No really, that's what it's about.The year 2012 looked like the start of a promising era for Democrats. Obama had just won his second term as president, the Dems had taken a big majority in the Senate, and the party had earned 1.3 million more votes than the GOP. So how on earth did the House of Representatives stay in the hands of Republicans?? Former Salon editor-in-chief David Daley says it all comes down to one word: gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the drawing of congressional boundaries such that the district demographic favors one party over another. And it’s bad for American democracy. Really bad. Just check out the title of Daley’s new book: Ratf**ked: The True Story Behind The Secret Plan to Steal America’s Democracy.Join Kamau and Hari on this fascinating and terrifying journey through gerrymandering, and find David Daley’s book Ratf**ked on Amazon! https://www.amazon.com/Ratf-ked-Behind-Americas-Democracy/dp/1631491628Got a minute? Come meet Kamau and Hari in person! Hari is promoting his new album “Mainstream American Comic” at a local venue near you, and Kamau is zig-zagging across the country with the “W. Kamau Bell Curve.” Learn more at http://www.harikondabolu.com/ and http://www.wkamaubell.com/.Special thanks to Evgeny Teilor for the use of “Unveiling Soul”: http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Evgeny_Teilor/https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/Keep tweeting us at #politicallyreactive!

      <title>Pastor Michael McBride Says Stop Reaching for Whiteness</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We talk Black Lives Matter and setting white people free.There are two things that Pastor Michael McBride is sure of: Jesus... and white supremacy.

      <title>Dog Whistling with Ian Haney-López</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Our first show!On the first episode of this brand new show, comedians W. Kamau Bell and Hari Kondabolu start digging into the strange facets of our political system. Berkeley professor Ian Haney-López joins them to talk about dog whistling in politics. They get into some of the history of this coded language we've heard so much of in politics. Some of it seems obvious - like from former Alabama Governor George Wallace - but some of it is harder to decipher...anyone remember Bill Clinton playing sax on Arsenio?We'll get into all of it! Like how Hilary's language fits into this today. And when Trump says he wants "to build a wall" - is that dog whistling or is he just being a straight up racist dickhole? Tune in every Wednesday throughout the election for a new episode. But since it's our first week, we're giving you two!If you've got questions or a topic you want to hear about, tweet us at #politicallyreactive.]]>
