<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leigh, together with Elina Halonen, runs the <strong><em>Irrational Agency</em></strong>, which takes the latest scientific discoveries in psychology and behavioural economics, blends it with their hands-on experience of marketing and business, and turns them into powerful, incisive market research techniques.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 2012, Leigh condensed his experience in pricing and the marketing of several of his businesses into a new book <em>The Psychology of Price: How to use price to increase demand, profit and customer satisfaction</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Leigh is co-founder of the <em>London Behavioural Economics Network</em>, writes for the <em>Pricing Revolution</em> and the <em>Knowing and Making</em> blogs, and regularly features as an economics commentator on BBC News, Radio 4, Research Magazine and other media.</span></p>

<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">why mathematics is essential for theorising and modelling economics, especially behavioural economics.</span></li>

<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">why a lack of mathematics is holding back the discipline of behavioral economics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">why we shouldn’t use the current maths of economics to explain human behavior.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">about the need to use the mathematics of computer science in behavioral economics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">whether big data could influence an individuals' consumption behaviors.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">what cognitive economics is and how different it is the behavioral economics.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><span class="s1">about the paradox of self-awareness in cognitive economics when faced with choices.</span></li>

<p class="p1">Leigh, together with Elina Halonen, runs the <em>Irrational Agency</em>, which takes the latest scientific discoveries in psychology and behavioural economics, blends it with their hands-on experience of marketing and business, and turns them into powerful, incisive market research techniques.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2012, Leigh condensed his experience in pricing and the marketing of several of his businesses into a new book <em>The Psychology of Price: How to use price to increase demand, profit and customer satisfaction</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Leigh is co-founder of the <em>London Behavioural Economics Network</em>, writes for the <em>Pricing Revolution</em> and the <em>Knowing and Making</em> blogs, and regularly features as an economics commentator on BBC News, Radio 4, Research Magazine and other media.</p>

<ul>
<li class="p1">the importance of academics and practitioners working together to further the discipline of economics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1">why finding the sweet-spot between controlled experiments and realism is difficult yet important.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<p>This is Part 1 of a 2 part compilation of episodes that you and I considered to be the highlights of the year.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although I did my utmost to choose a 'best of' compilation that captured the essence of this podcast, it was extremely difficult to leave out some of my amazing guests. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I loved all my guests and every single one of them gave up their time to speak to me about their career, their research and personal lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They exposed themselves to you, my amazing listeners, and answered questions that they had not seen before. It was almost impossible to choose who to leave in and who to leave out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both end of year ‘Best of 2015’ episodes gives us a snapshot of some topics that were discussed - like a time capsule for the Economic Rockstar podcast of 2015. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’ve been with me all year, then this episode will act as a refresher and take you back to some of the debates that abound the fields of economics. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you’re new to the show or relatively new, then perhaps these episodes will offer you a window to glimpse into the show and type of guests and topics that we cover. </span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Yoram Bauman is considered the world's first and only stand-up economist and uses cartoons to explain economic concepts and theories.

Every year Yoram organizes the Humor Session at the American Economic Association annual meeting.</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s1">Yoram is an advocate for carbon pricing and other economic approaches to protecting the environment. Yoram has written extensively on these issues but has also published numerous micro and macro books with comedy and entertainment as its central theme.

Some of these books have been translated into over 10 languages.</span></p>
<p class="p2" style="text-align: justify;"><span class="s2"><strong><em>In this interview, Yoram mentions and discusses: </em></strong>adverse selection, portfolio selection theory, the invisible hand, environmental economics, environmental taxes, market power, monopoly, corruption, opportunity cost, free market, revenue-neutral carbon taxes, consumption tax, tragedy of the commons, externalities, correlation, hyperinflation, population growth, economic growth, monetary base and rational expectations.</span></p>
