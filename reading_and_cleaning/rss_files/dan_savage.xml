(The more dignified word is "urologist." ) On the Magnum, Dan does just that, chatting with the good Doctor Stephen King, to answer a couple questions about curved dicks, and a mysterious clit-like growth. Hot! And, the Madonna/Whore Complex: It's not just for breeders!

A 47 year-old woman has just started working at a sex toy store, and loves her funky, kinky co-workers. But she's scared to invite them to her wedding for fear that mommy and daddy won't approve. On the Magnum, Dan chats with Emily Best, the force behind "F*ck Yes" -a new channel that offers up super-hot shorts showing how consent can be very sexy indeed. We love what they are doing, and you should check it out. And, did you know that Dan has some strong opinions about guns? The usually shy and retiring Dan Savage offers his take on the argument that "if you ban guns only criminals will have guns."

Dan enlists Marquis- a black man who knows what the hell is going on here. And Dan explains the nature of the sugar daddy/sugar baby relationship to a nervous lady. Don't be nervous.

On the Magnum, Dan chats with Slate writer Mark Joseph Stern, about the infuriating phenomenon of left wing anti-semitism. 206-302-2064 This episode of the Savage Lovecast is sponsored by OMGyes.com: a website dedicated to getting scientific truths out about women's sexual pleasure.

On the Magnum, a man wishes LA had the kind of kinky parties that NYC has. Whip smart dominatrix Justine Cross explains how to find the best sex parties and how BEHAVE YOURSELF when you get there.

A woman has been with her fiancé for 5 years. He loves to play with her nipples, but she hates it. And guess what? She has never told him this. Before they wed, how can she confess that she's been grinning and bearing it the whole time? On the Magnum, how drunk does a straight boy have to be before he'll get it on with another guy? An intrepid scientific researcher went into the field to find out. And a lesbian wonders how she can improve her relationship with her father, when he thinks she's possessed by the devil.

But now the boyfriend is getting closer and closer to the new guy. Do we have a problem here? On the Magnum, Dan chats with our go-to sex toy expert Erica Moen, to discuss "a whole bunch of dildos," a comprehensive round-up of anal lubes, and a toy for women with a misguided name.

And, a building manager is faced with the unenviable task of chastising a tenant couple for having ear-splittingly loud sex, AND chastising their neighbor for recording the whole thing. 206-302-2064 This episode is brought to you by Seeso, the subscription streaming service that delivers the very best comedy.

			<description><![CDATA[A woman's in-laws have 12 cats. They won't travel to see the caller's family (including the 2 small children,) because they can't bear to leave the mewling kitties. Are they mentally ill and is there any way to explain this behavior to the kids? A bondage-loving lass goes to clubs and gets tied up by a strictly platonic tying partner. Her boyfriend is ok with it, but feels a little spooked. How can she reassure him that what she and the tying partner do isn't sex? On the Magnum, it's our first do-over! Dan realized he cocked up the answer to the woman who would lose bladder control when she gave blow jobs. This time, Dan brings in Dr. Rachel Gelman- an actual pelvic health specialist who knows what the hell she's talking about. She lives in the UK, he in the States. He is her dom, and also her cousin. They are deeply closeted about their relationship to family and friends. So, what's the problem? 206-302-2064 Today’s Lovecast is brought to you by ThredUp, the largest online consignment and re-sale store.

Hear the sordid tale of the Ambien-befuddled, drunky, but also kind of hot step-mother who came on to her step-son in a most aggressive and lascivious way. Now that some years have passed should the caller seek redress? On the Magnum, remember the "Cannibal Cop?" He was the NYPD cop who chatted with his buddies about plans to kidnap, kill and eat ladies. And now he's a co-author! Dan interviews co-author Brian Whitney about the book, and the...unsavory issues it raises. A woman is dating a man who is so jealous that he insisted that she get rid of her bed, sheets, pillows- everything associated with a previous lover. And guess what?

A 19 year-old bi lass worries that she’ll never get to try ladies if she stays with her monogamous-minded man…forever. Is there any hope for her?

How can he proceed with caution in this delicate situation? On the Magnum, Dan chats with Vocative writer Tracy Clark-Flory about the plight of the virtuous pedophile. Also, a man is considering sex work. So long as he keeps himself safe, is this a good idea?

In other yucky family dramas, a woman’s father has advanced dementia, and tugs it openly, all the time. It’s gotten to the point where she doesn’t want to see a single penis- not even her dear boyfriend’s. How can she get her father out of her sex-head? Man. What is going on out there? On the Magnum, Dan chats with Emily Bazelon and Mistress Matisse about decriminalization of prostitution. And, even though gay marriage is finally legal in this country, a lesbian still finds the concept of a lesbian wedding ridiculous. Dan helps her tease her discomfort apart. 206-302-2064 This episode is also brought to you by <a href=“http://www.adamandeve.com”>AdamandEve.com</a> Get 10 free gifts, plus free shipping when you enter offer code "Savage".

			<description><![CDATA[At the top of the show, Dan speaks with a clever lass with a foolproof plan to ensure the defeat of Canada’s dreadful Stephen Harper. A man is very close to an old childhood friend. Although they have always had a platonic relationship, his girlfriend of 6 months is beginning to freak out. If he attended a wedding as his pal's plus-one, would that be crossing a line? A woman's new boyfriend told her he's into cuckolding. But how soon is too soon to indulge this complicated fetish? A self-professed sex addict jerks it so hard and so often that he has a raw dick with scars to show for it. But is this really sex addiction? Dr. David Ley, author of "The Myth of Sex Addiction" begs to differ. Dan chats with that hilarious, half-mulleted lesbian Cameron Esposito! They talk about shaving down there, letting go of exes and desperate, sex-starved, pregnant straight ladies. Some of their conversation is on the Micro and the whole dang thing is on the Magnum. Cuz that's how we hook you in. 206-302-2064   The Savage Lovecast is sponsored by Casper, an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the price -- because everyone deserves a great night’s sleep.  Get $50 off any mattress purchase by visiting casper.com/savage and enter the promo code savage.

How can he explain to her that he's playing by the rules?  It gets much worse. We won't reveal all here, but let's just say that your father might be into panties.  And finally in our trilogy of parental distress, how the hell do you tell your kids that your family is…special? Dan brings on poly lawyer Diana Adams to help.  Over in Magnumtown... In this week's "What You Got?" Dan chats with Dr. Arielle Kuperberg about her study showing that if you marry young, you're more liable to get divorced, duh.  A married man and the little lady like to go out on the town and have some sexy time. But he's not as young as he used to be, and likes to enhance the evening with Viagra. Should he tell her about the Tinkerbell pills?  And, tattoos.

			<description><![CDATA[A man and his wife have agreed to divorce. But they have to keep living together for 3 more months. Would it be shabby to start sleeping with the hot gal that lives down the block?  An 18 year old girl is engaged to be married to a man who she already knows to be sexually incompatible with her. So what's the problem? Dan chats with Dr. David Sarwer about libido changes following weight-loss surgery.  In Magnum-land, a couple embarking on an open relationship disagree on who to tell and how to tell about their new, scandalous status.  And, you're going to want to gather 'round the Thanksgiving table with your entire family and listen to the tale of a woman who went a-snooping and discovered that her sister is in a sugar-baby/sugar daddy relationship. Dan chats with the PR lass at a sugar daddy website about how wholesome and innocent this arrangement must truly be.  It warms the heart.    206-201-2720 This episode is sponsored by ExtremeRestraints.com.

Dan speaks with Ellyn Ruthstrom of the Bisexual Resource Center on coming out, and seeking acceptance from both straight and gay folks.  A bi woman who is married to a man wonders how to let the world know she's bi, when the topic doesn't come up all that often. On the Magnum show, strap on your bonnets people, it's Simon Doonan, fashion correspondent, window dresser, and generally hilarious human. (We suspect he might be a homosexual.) He and Dan dish about panties, rimming and what the tech-savvy at-risk youth are wearing this season.  Also, 28 miles per hour? Really?    206-201-2720 This episode is brought to you by Squarespace.com. They make it easy to build a website or blog.

Is she obliged to testify against him?  On the big, ole Magnum version, Dan and porn actress, director and producer Joanna Angel, talk about the porn industry, and what they do to keep their actors safe from STIs.  An unfortunate man is married to a woman who a) won't let him watch porn, b) won't let him masturbate and c) won't fuck him. Guess what Dan's advice is.  Do you get boners from the strangest things? We want to hear about it.  206-201-2720 This podcast is brought to you by ExtremeRestraints.com.

Dan sets him on a better course.  A woman's older boyfriend insists her gay friends are out to sleep with her. Dan senses dark machinations at work.  Are you, a straight woman, obliged to inform your hook-up that his dick stinks to high heaven? On the Magnum version, Dan interviews feminist blogger Amanda Marcotte on the hysteria surrounding female sexuality and hook-up culture on college campuses. A woman is so darned pretty that she can't have any male friends because they ALL want to sleep with her.  Dan speaks with male burlesque sensation Waxy Moon on the differences between burlesque and stripping, and what to do if your boyfriend doesn't want to see you in pasties.  Today's episode is brought to you by AdamandEve.com.

			<description><![CDATA[Her boyfriend wants it every day. She can manage 4-6 times per week but he still berates her for not putting out enough. Who's side will Dan come down on?  Here's another gem of a boyfriend: He won't compliment her or show any signs of affection. He hasn't told his friends about her, and won't pay for anything or inconvenience himself in any way. Foreplay? Nope! And yet, our heroine is still smitten. Meanwhile, over at Seattle's gay pride parade, did an angry mob of lesbians brutally attack a kind and hapless preacher? JoeMyGod's Joe Jervis has the story.  On the Magnum version, we present a drinking game. Every time you hear the word "whatever" or "yadda, yadda, yadda," you take a shot.  In a sobering call, we learn of a bad case of Domestic Partnership Castration Syndrome, in which a man loses his erections after going through the commitment ceremony.  And, a fem dom woman prepares to go to a party where the women wear clothes and men remain naked. Will she and her cross-dressing boyfriend have a good time? Will the other subs in the room imprint on her like a mama duckling?  206-201-2720 This episode is brought to you by Audible.

			<description><![CDATA[Hooray for happy rants! Dan tells you how he felt and what he did when he found out that DOMA was repealed.  A man's random ejaculation resulted in a child. Now the child is 12 and neither she, nor her mother's husband knows that he is her biological father. Should he tell?  Is there a way to warn the straight females of the world about your sociopathic sex addict ex-boyfriend?  On the Magnum version, an interview with the father of the modern marriage movement, Evan Wolfson, on the implications of DOMA's repeal. Remember this political moment, children. And, a long rant on the Republican war on women in general, and abortion specifically. And the usual tales of sordid depravity.  This podcast is brought to you by ExtremeRestraints.com. Go buy something, and be sure to enter GGG2013 at checkout.]]></description>

What he suggests…may shock you.  And, the inimitable Garfunkel & Oates come on the show to explain a shameful evasive strategy that many women have mastered.  On the Magnum side, Dan talks to a man who may have to adopt his own niece, because his brother (the baby's father) is in and out of jail.   Choking!

			<description><![CDATA[OMG! Don't you hate it when you go to a gay bar, make out with TWO gay men (even though you are a woman), and then totally don't remember it because you were, like, too drunk?

			<description><![CDATA[Two tales of parental meddling: A woman is in a happily open relationship with her boyfriend. But her parents don't know they're both free to see other people. What happens when her dad catches the boyfriend courting another lady? Another woman is in a blissful relationship with a man 20 years her senior.

Me so horny, you so ugly: A young, newly single hottie is hornier than ever, but everyone she could get with seems ugly to her. Spare Tire: A man asks Dan if he's fat, though Dan will never set eyes on him. Trans Flip-Flop: First she was attracted to girls; then she became a he and now he's attracted to boys. The juicer: Listen in as a sleepy straight boy in his underwear tries to explain why he wouldn't go down on his overly wet ex-girlfriend. And a 50-year-old lesbian finds she has a hankering for... men! You just never know, you know. 206-302-2064.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[On this week's Savage Lovecast: When does a poly relationship turn to poison?  Dan solves an interoffice squabble about whether female ejaculation is a myth or a beautiful, sloppy reality. A guy with little sexual experience has fears about approaching women. Should he be honest about his inexperience? A pretty but heavy girl is trapped in a beach town with a bunch of skinny babes and immature jackasses. How long must she wait to catch a good man who appreciates a curve or two? And finally: Poor, poor Owen. Owen is the boy a previous caller moved to New York for, despite his selfish, manipulative behavior. He called the show to assure Dan that he was in the right, his girlfriend was lying, and their relationship is just fine. Listen to the carnage that ensues. 206-302-2064. If you've been on the show, please call and give us an update!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This week: Slow down, kinky lady! This gal is bursting with libido and kinky desires. But she doesn't want to unleash them on just anyone, until she trusts him. How can she communicate this to her partners without freaking them the fuck out? Ass hair. He's got it, lots of it. Why do we have it? Is there an evolutionary advantage? Does it trap farts IN?

			<description><![CDATA[Here are the dilemmas and concerns that Dan Savage helps his listeners grapple with this week: He loves her. She loves him. But he wants to dominate her and she just wants some sweet, sweet lovin'. A Caucasian lady offers some advice of her own to our nation's African-American gentlemen. Is one loving teaspoon enough? And, when it comes to orgasms, she's a lone wolf. Can Dan help a young lady learn to share her most intimate moments with others? Listen in. And would it kill you to call? 206-302-2064. It's a voicemail. Record your question, using a land line if at all possible, and maybe we'll use it. Leave your phone number if you're up for a follow-up call.]]></description>
