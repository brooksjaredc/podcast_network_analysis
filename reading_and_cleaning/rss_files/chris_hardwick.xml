    <title>ID10T with Chris Hardwick</title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>I am Chris Hardwick. This podcast used to be called Nerdist. Now it is not. It is still basically just me talking about stuff and things with my two nerdy friends Jonah Ray and Matt Mira when they’re available, and usually someone more famous and smarter than all of us. Swearing is still fun, so we still do that occasionally. I hope you like this new iteration which is the same as before, but if a name hangs you up unhealthily I’m sure you will not hesitate to unfurl your rage not only in the ‘reviews’ section but also now on all the various social media platforms that have popped up since we started in 2010, effectively murdering blogs.</p>]]>

      <title>Tom Holland</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Get ready for the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! The Marvel Cinematic Universe's new Spidey, Tom Holland, was Chris Hardwick's guest on the latest installment of the Nerdist Podcast. And together, they're spinning a web about Spider-Man: Homecoming. After sharing a funny story about the '70s Spider-Man TV series, Tom was quick to admit that most of his in-costume scenes were filmed in a motion capture studio. However, he stressed that it is almost always him in the costume. Tom also related the feeling of powerlessness he felt when his face was covered, before finding ways to convey his performance through the rest of his body. Chris and Tom also speak about the new tone used in Spider-Man: Homecoming, which plays a lot like a John Hughes movie. Although both Tom and Chris agreed that they would probably embrace a life of crime if they had superpowers. Tom went on to relate his Lip Sync Battle experience, and how he felt when he had to "become" Rihanna. Amazingly, Tom hasn't had a chance to really process how much his life has changed since his first appearance as Spider-Man in Captain America: Civil War. He also pointed out that the final movie would work as a high school comedy even if all of the Spider-Man scenes were cut out of it. Additionally, Tom recalls the time that he forgot to use an American accent in one of the scenes from Homecoming. According to Tom, no one noticed it until he pointed it out. It's a long chat between Tom and Chris, so sit back, and enjoy!  ]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Personal computing icon turned philanthropist Bill Gates has finally made it to the Nerdist! Chris, Matt, and Jonah caught up with Bill in Seattle to talk about how the digital revolution is turning your phone into a debit card, Bill’s earliest memories of the computer revolution, and how difficult it is to get a whole world behind eradicating disease. They also discuss the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and this year's annual Gates Foundation Letter!
And as a special add-on to the podcast this week, Chris and crew spoke with Jay Wenger – director of the Gates Foundation’s polio eradication efforts and former CDC epidemiologist – and Julie Sunderland, director of program-related investments at the foundation. They talk about why improving global health is much more complicated than just throwing money at a problem, and if the former epidemiologist is afraid of zombies.]]>

      <title>Bad Dovahkiins - Theme from "COPS: Skyrim"</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hey Podcastinauts! "COPS: Skyrim" is a show on the Nerdist YouTube channel (youtube.com/nerdist) that I am thrilled we are putting out, having been obsessed with Skyrim since it came out last November (Dark Elf Mage, Level 46). When Bryan Basham (producer, "Death & Return of Superman") pitched this show to us I pleaded for a title song mash-up of "Bad Boys" and Skyrim's Dragon-tongued theme, "Dragonborn". Thanks to EG Music (Evan Goldman) it turned out even better than I had hoped. Since he made a full song that we only use a piece of on the show, I just wanted to share it in its entirety because I love it unnaturally so. I know this isn't a podcast ep in your feed, but I hope you enjoy this little bit of bonus Nerdist material nonetheless. Enjoy your goat leg burritos, and may your shouts grant you unrelenting force, young Dovahkiins! -ch]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Gabe Diani & Etta Devine are a wonderfully hilarious comedy team and longtime friends of Chris (Nerdist Stand-Up Cluster 2). They ran a successful kickstarter campaign to make "Huck Finn: Robotic Edition" and are currently raising money to get their film "The Selling" a theatrical release. Because we have a lot of creative-y types who listen to the show, we brought them on to share their insight about making film, sketch comedy and books from scratch. They are the ultimate DIYers, so pull up a chair (or stand if you really feel like it) and take some notes. If you've been on the fence about making a thing you want to make, the time is now!]]>

      <title>Neil deGrasse Tyson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Matt and I ventured to New York to chat up one of their favorite people Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is always the smartest person in the room. Any room. Dr. Tyson is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Rose Center for Earth and Space. He also hosts NOVA scienceNOW on PBS and the ever enthralling StarTalk, which Mira and I were lucky enough to sit in on for the episode posting November 13th. Beyond all that, HE IS FUNNY. Like, actually hilarious.
This ep covers everything from Cosmology to quarks with a side of space sex. We had damn near unhealthy amounts of fun and I hope to con Dr. Tyson to coming on again in the near future.]]>

This was done in the African Hall amidst a collection of animal exhibits, but we on the Nerdist podcast managed to capture the finest exhibit of all--the unruly and wild VERONICA BELMONT. See what I did there? I made it sound like she was one of the creatures. Truly, though, she rules a lot, as you will hear. Also, the audio is screwy. We only had access to docent head-mics and they don't record well, but Veronica's awesomeness will pierce through that to stab you in the heart with good times.]]>

      <title>Penn &amp; Teller</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Okay! It's really a solo Penn Jillette show. But I knew Teller wouldn't talk anyway so I just listed it as "Penn & Teller". Thought that would be clever and amusing. As I'm typing it, I can see now that I was wrong. Too lazy to delete it all and start over though, despite the fact that it would actually take me less time to do that than to explain and disclaim it. I'm weird! I'm a crazypants! Cock-a-doodle-SQUEEEEEE!!! All squeeing aside, Penn was a truly wonderful guest. We talked about the space program, song poems, bowling, his new show on Discovery "Penn & Teller Tell A Lie", PLUS we got the full little person/chimp story that I referenced to Adam Savage on Nerdist Podcast #10. This episode is like a suitcase full of steak! PACKED and MEATY. Also delicious. #goodtimes]]>

        <![CDATA[Recorded live in front of 800 Nerds at San Diego Comic-con on 7/23, this awesometastic mashup of television space travelers yields some of our best podcast moments.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[DYN-O-MITE! DYN-O-MITE! Our second live show at NerdMelt was epic explosion of all things awesome as we welcomed the director and cast of Black Dynamite to celebrate the release of the 1st issue of the BD comic, "Slave Island" (which you should SPRINT to buy immediately). Black Dynamite is one of our favorite comedies of all time, so this ruled a lot. On the panel: Scott Sanders (director), Brian Ash (writer of "Slave Island"), Byron Minns (Bullhorn), and Black Dynamite himself, Michael Jai White. Thanks to the 150 people who came out! This was a Blacktastic night for all! 
 
PS - This is a GREAT listen particularly if you're an indie filmmaker/comedy writer because these guys did it RIGHT.]]>

        <![CDATA[Nick Kroll (The League, Fabrice Fabrice, Bobbie Bottleservice, name rhymes with "Rickroll") got heckled by a grip while auditioning for SNL. He didn't get the job. For this reason, you should feel bad for him and watch his one hour comedy special "Thank You Very Cool," premiering Saturday, January 29th at 10p ET on Comedy Central. Chris, Matt & Jonah were able to suspend a single muon in a makeshift particle accelerator and tear the very fabric of space-time. In the first timestream, these last three sentences didn't exist. They reached backwards through a charged portal and added them just to freak your brain out if you happening to be on strong drugs while reading this. Yes, you. I'M TALKING TO YOU. I'm sure the drugs have kicked in. Now waffle keyhole iron boot!]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In addition to invading your brain with iconic characters such as Stimpy (and later Ren), Fry, & Doug, Billy West also did funny make-em-ups on the Howard Stern show in the early 90s. IF THAT TWEREN'T ENOUGH he's also a world class musician. In this chat, he piled so much fascinating insight into the psyche of the comedian onto the show that our brain-roofs caved in under the pressure of awesomeness. I am convinced that the recent Metrodome incident happened SOLELY for the purpose of providing an appropriate metaphor to relate it. Plus, he's nice, which is always my favorite thing.]]>

        <![CDATA[ELEVENTH DOCTOR MATT SMITH!!! Anyone who follows anything I do probably has heard my numerous blabbings about how much I love Doctor Who. After one such blabbing on the tweetstream, I was contacted by Devin Johnson at the BBC who graciously offered to help get Matt on the podcast if at all possible. AND SO IT CAME TO PASS. I would like to smother Devin, Matt Stein and the BBC with an absurd pile of thanks. 
Matt Smith loves chess, Alan Partridge and cookies. Every charming character trait you see in the Eleventh Doctor is all Matt. It was an extreme pleasure hanging out with him, and we look forward to some sweet Doctor on Dickens action for the Doctor Who Xmas special on December 25th, 9p ET on BBC America.
Joining me this episode were fellow Whovians Matt Mira and Janet Varney.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Special live show! We packed our ironic tshirts and trekked up to Seattle for the insanely fun Bumbershoot Festival!  Matt, Jonah & I set up shop in the Charlotte Martin Theatre (within  pooping distance of the Space Needle) and were joined by wonderlady  comedy duo Garfunkel & Oates, the fantastic David O'Doherty (who is hilarious and Irish), a surprise guest, and about 500 lovable nerd voyeurs who just came to watch. PS -  our surprise guest was Doug Benson. I realize that that spoils the surprise. I'm just not sure anyone reads these little descriptions anyway. I could write something like "whale-fisting clown farts," and no one would notice it here. See? You didn't bother reading that. Carry on, then.]]>

        <![CDATA[ALL 5 MYTHBUSTERS IN ONE PLACE: Jamie, Adam, Tory, Grant & Kari!  I feel like I should have sealed them in mylar or jammed them all together to form some kind of Mega-Mythbusting Bot, but instead we just chatted in front of a few thousand people about life, near-death and the busting of myths. This panel was 50 kinds of fun, at least 4 of which should be illegal in most states (excluding Nevada).]]>

        <![CDATA[BONUS EPISODE!

After attending the keynote (which I rather enjoyed) I sat down with my pals Ryan Block of gdgt.com, Mark McClusky of Wired, and Jason Chen of Gizmodo (yes, *that* Jason Chen) to discuss the ins, outs, ups, downs and whichways of the Apple news that was kickin' it Steve Jobs-style earlier today on a gorgeous day in San Francisco.]]>

      <title>Alison Brie</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alison Brie stars in Mad Men and Community. She is hilarious, and if there were a drug for delightfulness, certainly it would be synthesized from her DNA. She also prefers shorts to jeans. Also, Chris lost his virginity to a Belinda Carlisle song, Jonah got locked in his building due a faulty garage gate, and in addition to the Dave Matthews Band, Matt also loves Regina Spektor. I think he wants to be their baby.

      <title>Adam Savage Live @ Largo!</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The fantastically brilliant Adam Savage of "Mythbusters" joined us for our very first live  podcast! This was recorded at Largo in Los Angeles on April 5th, 2010 in  front of a kick-ass crowd of delightful humans. As these people had  exchanged hard-earned dollars for seats to this show, we made it a  little longer than a normal podcast by incorporating live performances  and taking Q & A from them at the end.
*SPECIAL NOTE: Adam did stand-up for the FIRST TIME in his  life and DESTROYED. It was truly hilarious and I hope he continues to do it! 
*SPECIAL NOTE #2: We all swear a lot in this, so if you wanted  to listen to this with your kids, think again unless you're sure the  Internet has already taught them way worse things than F-bombs.
Excelsior!]]>
