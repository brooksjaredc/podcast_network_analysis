      <title>Ep. 69 - Rosanna Pansino</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Aaaaaand we're back! And better than ever!
- We return from hiatus with Rosanna Pansino, delightful human and host of Nerdy Nummies, who drops in to talk about her love of 90s R&B, working with her family, her "perfect" recipe, and "low-class" cakes. Also, she takes about four sips of a bloody mary and I'm pretty sure she's completely wasted by the end of this interview. Which is great, because she gets adorably giggly when she's drunk. Enjoy!

      <title>Ep. 66 - Hank Green</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Join me this week for my very special guest, Hank Green! We get into all the important issues: LA vs Montana, farts, and how to scam your local movie theater out of the most peanut M&Ms. But, seriously. Guys. I'm just going to warn you now -- this episode gets very political. And I don't know where you, personally, fall in the "sesame seeds as condiment" debate (pro OR con), but be warned. Things were said which cannot be unsaid. You don't want to miss this one.

      <title>Repost - Ep. 56 - Brittany Furlan</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hey guys, we need to take this week to adjust some technical things on our end, but we will be back next week with a fresh new episode with Hank Green! In the meantime, I wanted to repost this very funny interview I did with Brittany Furlan, because for some reason it got lost on the iTunes download page, and I know a lot of you missed it. Also be sure to check out last week's chat with the hilarious Joselyn Hughes, ICYMI. (Apologies, again, for our server issues.) Enjoy!
- I'm super excited about this week's guest, because she is both hilarious and very nice. And those are two qualities that I truly appreciate. It's actress, comedian, and Viner Brittany Furlan!
- I feel like we really got to know each other, through our in-depth conversation about googling dog emotions, our weird red carpet experiences, and the strangest thing she's ever licked. And now you can get to know Brittany too. Because we totally recorded that conversation and are releasing it now, as a podcast!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[One of my favorite YouTubers, the hilarious Drew Monson, joined me on the podcast this week and I could not stop laughing. You'll see why. We really get into it, answering all the serious questions. Like, why does Goofy want to cut his hair so badly? What was it like going to a hippie elementary school? Where do we see ourselves in ten years?? Also, why he would very much like for you to STOP CALLING HIM DADDY.

      <title>Ep. 51 - Krampus - The Movie - with Mitchell Davis and Jack Ferry</title>

        <![CDATA[What? You think we WEREN'T going to review the movie Krampus?? Yes, it may have started as a joke on the podcast, but Mitchell Davis, Jack Ferry, and I all actually went to see the movie, and here is our completely unsolicited review.
- Spoiler Alert!! We talk about this movie for over an hour (if you can believe it). So, YES there will be spoilers! Including some of Jack's very elaborate (and - let's be honest - questionable) theories about the film’s ending.  So make sure you've seen the movie first! Or if you don't care, that's fine too! Enjoy this special Christmas week episode! Happy Holidays you wonderful listeners!
- What did you think of this episode? Love it? Hate it? Feel incredibly medium about it? Head on over to iTunes and let us know! Maybe we'll do more movie review episodes? Who knows!
- FYI, this episode was not sponsored in any way by Krampus, or the studio, or the filmmakers. But we’ve been very good this year, so hopefully he won’t lick our foreheads.]]>

In this episode, you get to hear me spill a bloody mary all over my computer! (spoiler) But before that, we discuss where we’d like to fire a hot dog cannon! Whose butts we'd like to touch! And the creepy weirdness that is children's television! Also, Pinterest tips! What more could you ask for??

        <![CDATA[Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee's baaaaaaaaaaa-aaaack..! Sorry, did I scare you? Don't be scared. It's only returning guest (as well as maybe our most awkward podcast guest?) Chester See!
- In honor of the upcoming holiday, this week Jack Ferry and I sit down with Chester and talk about some spooky Halloween stories. Well, they're more stupid than spooky. But you might get spooked, who knows. Maybe try listening to this podcast in a haunted house? That should work. Try it! Anyway, this is a really fun, laid-back conversation, and I for one am glad we recorded it -- so you can enjoy it too!

      <title>Ep. 37 - "Oscar's Hotel" Special w/ PJ Liguori, Mamrie Hart, &amp; Mitchell Davis</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In honor of the upcoming release of "Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures," I thought it would be fun to have a chat with creator PJ Liguori (aka KickThePJ) about all the behind-the-scenes shenanigans that went into making the show. And because I love PODCAST shenanigans, I invited Mamrie and Mitchell over, too! So, it's amazing PJ was able to get a word in edgewise! But seriously, this is a really fun, freeform, chaotic (and LONG) chat about a very fun project that I'm proud to be a part of.
- Want to check out the actual "Oscar's Hotel" series and see me act out my spirit animal, an aloof hermit crab? Or Mamrie as a boozy octopus chef? Or Mitchell as a taxi driver painted completely red? (If that doesn't sell you, then this show probably isn't for you. But if so!) Go to:
oscarshotelseries.com
- And remember, this episode is brought to you for FREE by our extremely generous sponsor (and friend of the show) -- Loot Crate! Please go support them so they continue to support us!
- Then when you're finished, go leave us a review on iTunes!

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:summary>In honor of the upcoming release of "Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures," I thought it would be fun to have a chat with creator PJ Liguori (aka KickThePJ) about all the behind-the-scenes shenanigans that went into making the show. And because I love PODCAST shenanigans, I invited Mamrie and Mitchell over, too! So, it's amazing PJ was able to get a word in edgewise! But seriously, this is a really fun, freeform, chaotic (and LONG) chat about a very fun project that I'm proud to be a part of.
- Want to check out the actual "Oscar's Hotel" series and see me act out my spirit animal, an aloof hermit crab? Or Mamrie as a boozy octopus chef? Or Mitchell as a taxi driver painted completely red? (If that doesn't sell you, then this show probably isn't for you. But if so!) Go to:
oscarshotelseries.com
- And remember, this episode is brought to you for FREE by our extremely generous sponsor (and friend of the show) -- Loot Crate! Please go support them so they continue to support us!
- Then when you're finished, go leave us a review on iTunes!

      <title>Ep. 36 - Troye Sivan</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Troye Sivan may very well be a 50-year-old man trapped inside the body of 20-year-old pop star. This was such a hilarious episode to me, because Troye gets ABSURDLY excited by the most mundane things. Like... his passion for flossing! And his "soft teeth." And don't get me started on "Bubby." Troye, you are a man of many surprises. And by "man" I mean a "pale, porcelain baby." HIS WORDS.

      <title>Ep. 34 - Grace and Mitchell's Rants: Podcast Edition</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Guys, we're trying something new this week. Thought it would be fun to open up the format of the show a little bit, and make it a bit more conversational, with my dear friend Mitchell Davis. We got a chance to have a classic Grace & Mitchell rant and then let the conversation wander. And guess what? I had a really fun time making this episode! Who knew talking with friends could be so fun?? Did you enjoy it? Please let us know by leaving us a review on iTunes!
iTunes.com/nottoodeep
- Seriously, I'd like to know what you think. We've got another episode like this planned with Mamrie in a few weeks, so if you like this format, we'll probably do more like it, with more recurring guests. (But don't worry, we'll still be doing our normal format, with new guests, most weeks.)
- Please remember that this episode is brought to you for free by our extremely generous sponsor: Casper Mattresses. If you're looking for a new bed (especially a very comfortable one at a shockingly fair price), please support them - so they continue to support us! Just go to casper.com/grace and get $50 toward any mattress purchase.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hilarious YouTuber, comedian, host, and all-around entertaining human being Elliott Morgan stopped by for this week’s podcast, and I couldn't be more excited. We covered a lot of ground in this episode, including why bunny rabbits can only have desk jobs, why 90s Nickelodeon game shows are (still) THE BEST, and which Jenner family member he would choose to fart in front of, marry, or be kidnapped by. This is a super-sized episode, so let's bedazzle some neck braces, pee next to The Rock, and DO THIS.

      <title>Ep. 30 - Anna Akana</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[So excited to have Anna Akana on the show this week! She's so lovely and smart and super hard working and incredibly funny. If you don't know her, then prepare to fall in like with her. We discuss some very important issues, like socially awkward cheetahs, comment trolls, Anna's least favorite (and most rapey) Disney character, and, of course, S#!t!
#highbrowcomedy
- IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - We're taking next week off. I know, we just took last week off. Things are crazy with Vidcon, please find a way to DEAL. But get very excited because we will be back the following week with Kian Lawley! Yeah!

      <title>Ep. 29 - Joey Graceffa</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[I learned a LOT about Joey on this week's podcast. And a lot about Reality TV. Truly, we go DEEP into the behind-the-scenes reality that IS reality television -- it's super interesting and (as you'd expect) not always as real as it seems. Also, I learn that Joey is very good at sending out very mischievous tweets with basically ZERO hesitation. Who knew! This is a really fun episode with one of the sweetest gentlemen on the internet. Prepare to have your faces charmed off!
- IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT - We're taking next week off. So you have two full weeks to enjoy this episode. I expect you back here BRIGHT AND EARLY on July 20th for our new hilarious episode with the wonderfully talented miss Anna Akana.

      <title>Ep. 17 - Mark Douglas of Barely Political</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Happy Holidays my wonderful podcast listeners! This week on the show we welcome one of my best on-camera friends, Mark Douglas, from Barely Political and Key of Awesome. I say "on-camera friend" because, for some reason, we only seem to catch up when we're filming something. Well lucky for you, because this conversation is one of my favorites so far. I think we forgot, at some point, that we were filming, and happily shared some very embarrassing and altogether hilarious stories with each other. And we recorded it. And now that recording is my gift to you! MERRY CHRISTMAS. (No re-gifting.)

Last time I was in London, we had a hilarious chat about farting in your sleep (aka "night toots"), regrettable tattoos, and accidental innuendo. In fact Emma is The Queen of Accidental Innuendo. Her Hannah Hart story is all the proof you'll need.

      <title>Ep. 7 - Flula</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[BOOM! Flula is on the podcast! Well, he is every week in a way... (Because he did all our theme music.) But now you can listen to him TALK!
- If you don't know Flula, then you are in for a treat, because he is not only one of my favorite YouTubers, but also one of my favorite Germans in the WHOLE world (second only to my grandfather). He is just so funny and so quick, it's incredible. And he's got some hilarious, embarrassing stories to share with us. Just keep him away from your science projects.

Or Sex vs Alcohol, a fight to the death. Or peeing on your friends after they've been stung by jellyfish. Cheers, mates!

      <title>Ep. 5 - Mitchell Davis</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA["Farts on a Plane!" Did you guys ever see that movie? No? Well, not to worry, because this week I discuss it, at LENGTH, with my good friend Mitchell Davis.
- If you guys don't know Mitchell, you should. He is so great and so funny. We had a hilarious conversation, where we covered topics such as boy band names, extra body parts, fast food, and pooping at Target. Don't miss it! (If you listen carefully, you can hear Rhett & Link trying, not very hard, to stifle laughter).
- Fun Fact: We recorded this back when Mitchell was still living in Ohio. And he had such a good time, he decided to move to Los Angeles. (He drove.)
