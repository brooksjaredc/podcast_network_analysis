    <title>Truth &amp; Iliza</title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[Henry Rollins once said "Nothing brings people together more than mutual hatred"- and Iliza Shlesinger believes that. It's the driving force behind war, political movements, and trickling all the way down to a really good cat fight on an episode of Real Housewives. Iliza believes that there is too much positivity in the world and we all get excited for things that make us happy for moments, but ultimately fade. "Truth and Iliza" believes that anger lasts longer than love; and sometimes anger can create a beautiful thing. Join Iliza Shlesinger and her friends talk about all the things that bother them on "Truth and Iliza" every week!]]>

This episode is a must listen for any girl who has ever been frustrated with themselves or at a boy. Guys, this episode is a must listen because we unlock some of our lady brain secrets and talk about different types of drunk guys.

        <![CDATA[Iliza sits down with Guinness record holder most podcast downloads, Adam Carolla- the two friends who seemingly share a brain, talk about the perception of success and how it just makes you look gross when you hate rich people. Adam and Iliza bond over the fact that idiots run the world and love to come from a place of "NO" before granting you access to anything you deserve. Adam shares an enlightening story about putting a jaded Latino chick in place at the Arclight parking lot, Iliza name checks the idiot pharmacist who wouldn't give her her birth control because he was positive it was prescribed to a man with the exact same last name. Adam explains that genuine rage surpasses gender and race, and in some cases, a verbal smack is what most people need. The two discuss privilege and spoiled kids, working hard and the two of them GO OFF on The View. This episode is great for anyone who has ever silently raged against any system!

        <![CDATA[Iliza sits down with Thrillist senior editor Jeff Miller and it gets... amazing. This episode is all about food- subjects include how repulsive Iliza finds steak toppers, the debate over the essential burger ingredients, men's obsession with grilling, why GrubHub insists on only showing us Indian restaurants and why Indian restaurants are so weird about their Naan. They also discuss the simplicity of some foods like steak, food nostalgia, Jeff's mom carrying ranch dressing everywhere, why Brioche can suck it, Iliza's issues with LA Tacos and her uneducated aversion to eating goat, foie gras or lamb... We also find out foie gras is doled out in "lobes" and then Iliza has Jeff smell her earring.  Frozen yogurt, dessert martinis, disdain for avocados- these two basically cover everything you have ever hafted, loved or thought about food.
