B. Tauris, 2018) a recently published history of Arab exploration of space, offers a fascinating insight into fundamental issues shaping the contemporary Middle East, including efforts to turn Arab societies into twenty first-century knowledge-based economies and  the role of the religion and its relationship to science. Assistant Professor <a href="http://www.qatar.vcu.edu/people/jorg-matthias-determann" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jörg Matthias Determann</a> takes the reader on a highly readable and well-documented tour of the struggle of Arab scientists to contribute to the development on space studies and how scientific research contributes to reform and change in the Arab world. It is a process that often meant that scientists were forced to pursue their studies and explorations outside of the region and in doing so contributed to concepts of cosmopolitanism in the region.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Spanish flu of 1918-1920 was one of the greatest human disasters of all time. It infected a third of the people on Earth&#8211;from the poorest immigrants of New York City to the king of Spain, Franz Kafka, Mahatma Gandhi and Woodrow Wilson. But despite a death toll of between 50 and 100 million people, it exists in our memory as an afterthought to World War I.<br />
In this gripping narrative history, <a href="http://www.lauraspinney.com/">Laura Spinney</a> traces the overlooked pandemic to reveal how the virus travelled across the globe, exposing mankind&#8217;s vulnerability and putting our ingenuity to the test. As socially significant as both world wars, the Spanish flu dramatically disrupted&#8211;and often permanently altered&#8211;global politics, race relations and family structures, while spurring innovation in medicine, religion and the arts. It was partly responsible, Spinney argues, for pushing India to independence, South Africa to apartheid and Switzerland to the brink of civil war. It also created the true &#8220;lost generation.&#8221; Drawing on the latest research in history, virology, epidemiology, psychology and economics, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qu2sttZIIRv9e9nBrUAqm44AAAFjO3rTkwEAAAFKAVdtaHw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610397673/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1610397673&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=zRv0TCSkd6aHc.pnpeLxbQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World</a> (PublicAffairs, 2017) masterfully recounts the little-known catastrophe that forever changed humanity.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What do Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, media theorist Marshall McLuhan and Canadian popular culture have in common? This is the question that <a href="http://engl.athabascau.ca/faculty/mmccutcheon.php">Mark A. McCutcheon</a> seeks to answer in his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qhp3DB3-vBv5gJluKMOZvfQAAAFjEgzjEwEAAAFKASxfKk4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1771992247/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1771992247&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=-GvbXocwbX9a-wV23qPYxg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Medium Is the Monster: Canadian Adaptations of Frankenstein and the Discourse of Technology</a>, published in 2018 by Athabasca University Press. In this unique and penetrating analysis, McCutcheon argues that Shelley’s 1818 novel essentially reinvented the word “technology” for the modern age, establishing its connections with ominous notions of manmade monstrosity. In the twentieth century, this monstrous, Frankensteinian conception of technology was globalized and popularized largely through Marshall McLuhan’s media theory and its numerous, diverse adaptations in Canadian popular culture. The Medium is the Monster establishes Frankenstein, and its various adaptations, as the originating intertext for a modern conceptualisation of technology that has manifested with a unique potency in Canadian pop culture, informing works as disparate as David Cronenberg’s Videodrome, William Gibson’s Neuromancer, the fiction of Margaret Atwood, and even electronic dance music. Furthermore, McCutcheon undertakes an incisive of analysis of how Frankensteinian constructions of technology have shaped real-world discussions of science and industry, an intertextual discourse which he sees as most powerfully encapsulated in the rhetoric associated with the Alberta tar sands industry.<br />
Over the course of the interview, McCutcheon provides some fascinating insights into changing cultural attitudes towards technology, the influence of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, the novel’s relationship to McLuhan’s media theory, and the surprising scope of Shelley’s cultural impact.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The use of our data and the privacy, or lack thereof, that we have when we go online has become a topic of increasing importance as technology becomes ubiquitous and more sophisticated. Governments, advocacy groups and individual citizens are demanding that action be taken to protect their valuable data. But what does this sporadic noise amount to? <a href="https://bjmendelson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B.J. Mendelson</a> in his book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrccbV9OtfeKUVU-QZVZYxgAAAFjEigRNgEAAAFKAbtx5i0/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1912475014/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1912475014&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=oLVBtQPKnhbc9dADgUZw.g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy: And How to Get It Back</a> (Curious Reads, 2017) argues that a complacent citizenry and the overly-intimate relationship that corporations have with government has led to massive breaches of people’s privacy. Mendelson humorously explains the way people’s data is used and abused as he tracks the long history of government surveillance leading to an explanation of, what he believes, could be the solution to the abuse of people’s privacy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Early studies of the functions of the human brain used a simple method: wait for misfortune to strike&#8212;strokes, seizures, infectious diseases, lobotomies, horrendous accidents-and see how the victim coped. In many cases survival was miraculous, and observers could only marvel at the transformations that took place afterward, altering victims&#8217; personalities. An injury to one section can leave a person unable to recognize loved ones; some brain trauma can even make you a pathological gambler, pedophile, or liar. But the book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpY-Si4tkIBcwIr14y1wvagAAAFi_KF4fAEAAAFKATItcqY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316182346/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0316182346&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=sEKksBdHhy58zaU.1bRYTg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons: The History of the Brain as Revealed by True Stories of Trauma, Madness, and Recovery </a>(Back Bay Books, 2015) explains how a few scientists realized that these injuries were an opportunity for studying brain function at its extremes. With lucid explanations and incisive wit, <a href="http://samkean.com/samkean/">Sam Kean</a> explains the brain&#8217;s secret passageways while recounting forgotten stories of common people whose struggles, resiliency, and deep humanity made modern neuroscience possible.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Americans with Disability Act passed in 1990, but it was just one moment in ongoing efforts to craft the meaning and practice of “good design” that put people with disabilities at the center. In their new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qr8lThPsLbx0QWXMoiFESEwAAAFi93OkRAEAAAFKAUTpOMw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1517901642/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1517901642&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=e8hfzi.tkQaFHqMO8CQZkw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Access: Universal Design and the Politics of Disability</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2017), <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/mhs/faculty/aimi-hamraie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aimi Hamraie</a> takes a “sledgehammer to history” in the spirit of one guerrilla activist group that they track in the archives—among many other people, objects, and historical contexts. Hamraie focuses on work around “access-knowledge”—that is, the forms of expertise that were considered legitimate ways of knowing and responding to disability through design. What has counted as legitimate access-knowledge, Hamraie argues, indicates designers&#8217; goals: Was the aim of design to make productive workers, liberal consumers, or structures that materialized a commitment to spacial belonging? Who were the imagined users and how could new political priorities materialize in worlds already built? Answers to these questions made—and continue to remake—our material world and its frictions.  Hamraie brings their training in feminist epistemology to never-before-accessed archival materials, along with an array of historical images and documents. The result is a persuasive, beautiful, and intrepidly researched book. Building Access torques received wisdom in disability studies, history of science, and architectural design, and models how to attend to research, writing, and publishing as a material practice.<br />
Hamraie is Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University’s Center for Medicine, Health &amp; Society, and Director of Vanderbilt’s <a href="https://www.mapping-access.com/lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Design Lab</a>.<br />

Silverman</a> argues that Indian societies adopted firearm technology not because they were visually impressive or culturally significant (though they were both), but simply because they killed more efficiently. Using his concept of the “gun frontier,” Silverman, a professor of history at George Washington University, shows how contact between Natives and those Europeans willing to trade weapons for furs and other goods fundamentally altered the politics and power dynamics of a given region. Thundersticks draws on case studies from a broad sweep of time from the seventeenth to the mid-twentieth century, including the consolidation of Iroquois power, King Philip’s War, the otter fur trade in the Pacific Northwest, and the ascendency of the Blackfeet in the mountain west. Each story underscores the point that guns could both undermine colonial power as well as cause catastrophic conflict between Indian societies. Firearms changed Indian societies in innumerable ways, but when the gun trade lagged, so too did an individual polity’s power. Silverman’s book is a complicated, nuanced, look at how post-contact North America has long been a wildly interconnected place, and how it became a continent filled with blood and smoke.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[“What is needed now is not liberal reform or withdrawal, but a radical attack, a strategy of opposition. Scientific workers must develop ways to put their skills at the service of the people and against the oppressors.” (Zimmerman, et al. 1972).<br />
Following the 2014 conference, “Science for the People: The 1970s and Today,” <a href="http://sigridschmalzer.org/">Sigrid Schmalze</a><a href="http://sigridschmalzer.org/">r,</a> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/history/people/daniel-chard">Daniel Chard</a>, and <a href="https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/alyssa-botelho">Alyssa Botelho</a>, edited a volume of the Science for the People (SftP) movement, curating numerous documents from the group that are as relevant today as when they were published several decades ago. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnmUi7PIoVwZCw3jC1eOyOYAAAFi7wNCyAEAAAFKAQ4sMLI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1625343183/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1625343183&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=hZq5WS-YA926D4JiB-IaoQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science for the People: Documents from America’s Movement of Radical Scientists</a> (University of Massachusetts Press, 2018) encapsulates the diverse themes, research, and actions of the movement, which included chapters across the US at one time. Emerging from the radical political culture of the 1960s, and predecessor group, Scientists for Social and Political Action, SftP challenged the value-neutrality of science and technology, and instead sought to democratize science by engaging with other political movements and conducting research with non-experts. While much scientific research continues to be funded by the state or by corporations, SftP provided grassroots scientific and technological assistance and education in a multitude of settings. Just to take a few examples from the volume, these efforts included research for social movements, providing electrical power for a Black Panther free medical clinic, promoting the farming technique of intercropping, as well as distributing resources, literature and education to countries such as Vietnam and Nicaragua. The direction of assistance between SftP and other groups was rarely one-sided, as SftP members absorbed knowledge from other movements and places, as documented in the China: Science Walks on Two Legs selection, wherein several SftP members visited China and learned about some of the traditional science and peasant research conducted in the nation. In addition, through working groups and publications, SftP critiqued racist and sexist science, reductionist biology, nuclear power, weapons research, commercial agriculture, US imperialism, and much more. As their many articles and actions show, SftP did more than just critique mainstream science, they attempted to provide alternatives. Finally, SftP had a formative and lasting effect on Science and Technology Studies through its various studies on the social embeddedness of science and its political uses.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How do we create meaning after the genome? Such a profound question is at the center of the recently published book by <a href="https://jereardon.sites.ucsc.edu/">Jenny Reardon</a>, <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo22726485.html">The Postgenomic Condition: Ethics, Knowledge and Justice after the Genome</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017). Drawing upon nearly a hundred interviews including with genetic scientists, social scientists, activists, lawyers and policy makers, Reardon constructs an engaging story detailing accounts of genomic projects from several field sites around the globe. Beyond her ethnographic accounts, Reardon engages with historical antecedents, such as the infamous Tuskegee study and the following Belmont Report, as well as philosophical discussions and insights from the likes of Hannah Arendt and Jean François Lyotard. The result is a reconsideration of genomics in a society vexed by inequality, and a push toward matters of science and justice.<br />
Following the completion of the Human Genome Project, many subsequent genomic related projects (such as the Human Genome Diversity Project, Generation Scotland, and personal genomic projects like 23andMe) had to quibble with issues over labor, interpretation, cost, consent, and diversity. While many well-intentioned scientists hoped to be more inclusive and rebuke activist claims of “genetic colonialism”, these attempts fell through, due in part to problems of consent, structural inequalities, and conflicting points of view between scientists and potential DNA donors regarding the meaning and value of the genome. Other projects, such as Generation Scotland, had to deal with rising cost, and industry push toward more computerized, automated sequencing. For genomic researchers and investors, automation means reduced labor and reduced human error; however, citing Arendt, Reardon argues that such automation could jeopardize the very acts of meaningful speech that bring matters of concern, like the genome, into being. Instead, we should engage with a plurality of stories and gatherings around such matters of care and justice as they may come to constitute a new common world, including a transformed genomic science.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://english.la.psu.edu/faculty-staff/sxs62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susan M. Squier</a>’s book, <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/?p=72828&amp;preview=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epigenetic Landscapes: Drawings as Metaphor</a> (Duke University Press, 2017)  is about development— biological and ecological. It explores how the media (paintings, films, graphics) that experts have created to understand development and to communicate without verbal language has shaped—and continues to affect—the worlds in which we live.<br />
Squier’s book takes its title from a set of images from the embryologist C.H. Waddington, all meant to demonstrate his theory of how life developed—as a dynamic process emerging within multiple scales of time and space. The first Epigenetic Landscape was, literally, a landscape painting—thick and confounding—that Waddington commissioned from the artist John Piper. Over the next twenty years, Waddington created two additional images that suggested a less contextual, more individually focused conception of development.<br />
In her creative and persuasive book, Susan Squier follows iterations of the Epigenetic Landscape to spotlight moments of contingency in the new field of epigenetics in the 1960s and 1970s, when scientists had opportunities to follow interdisciplinary approaches, to emphasize multiple scales of time and space, and to take seriously process-oriented knowledge that defied orthodoxies of molecular genetics. Squier argues that attending to visual rhetoric of scientific fields, especially development, is an inroad both to understanding the history of those fields, and to imagining possible, more feminist, futures. In doing so, Squier shows that ways of knowing that have been separated as either “art” or “science” interact more often than is appreciated, and those lines of connection serve as important creative resources. Heeding her own call for transdisciplinary approaches, three chapters document how the Epigenetic Landscape has been used not only into embryology but also landscape design and bioArt.<br />
Squier is Brill Professor Emeritus of English and Women&#8217;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Penn State University. Her previous books include Liminal Lives and The Graphic Medicine Manifesto.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For thousands of years the human heart remained the deepest of mysteries; both home to the soul and an organ too complex to touch, let alone operate on. Then, in the late nineteenth century, medics began going where no one had dared go before. The following decades saw the mysteries of the heart exposed, thanks to pioneering surgeons, brave patients and even sacrificial dogs. In eleven landmark operations, <a href="http://www.thomas-morris.uk/about-this-blog/">Thomas Morris</a> tells us stories of triumph, reckless bravery, swaggering arrogance, jealousy and rivalry, and incredible ingenuity: the trail-blazing blue baby procedure that transformed wheezing infants into pink, healthy children; the first human heart transplant, which made headline news around the globe. And yet the heart still feels sacred: just before the operation to fit one of the first artificial hearts, the patients wife asked the surgeon if he would still be able to love her.<br />

It describes both a human story and a history of risk-taking that has ultimately saved millions of lives.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What if modern conservatism is less a reaction to environmentalism than a mutation of it? Historian <a href="http://cola.siu.edu/history/faculty-and-staff/faculty/zaretsky.php">Natasha Zaretsky&#8217;</a>s latest book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qh0WndTOCk3pUlBESbuEf00AAAFim8RcWgEAAAFKAVwgghE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231179812/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0231179812&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=QKJJhFSzV-NdrBHoMzvI3g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radiation Nation: Three Mile Island and the Political Transformation of the 1970s</a> (Columbia University Press, 2018), is a fine-grained examination of the local reaction to the most serious accident in the history of U.S. nuclear energy. It is also a sweeping study of the construction of arguments for and against nuclear energy and atomic weapons from the end of the World War II to the present. Zaretsky follows that debate through a transformative six-year debate in central Pennsylvania, where conservative activists launched protests that drew heavily from the examples of environmentalism, the antiwar movement, second-wave feminism, the black freedom struggle, and black and women&#8217;s health activism. Yet rather than pushing them to the left, their fight with pronuclear forces in industry and government made them more conservative. They articulated an ethnonationalist argument about a threatened nation betrayed by its leaders and illustrated it with ecological images of the damaged bodies of mothers, babies, and the unborn. This &#8220;biotic nationalism&#8221; helped conservatives paint a convincing picture of the America of the 1970s and 1980s and remains potent today, as visible in the &#8220;Crippled America&#8221; described by Donald Trump.<br />
Natasha Zaretsky is associate professor of history at Southern Illinois University. She is the author of No Direction Home: The American Family and the Fear of American Decline, 1968-1980 (UNC Press, 2007) and co-editor of Major Problems in U.S. History Since 1945 (4th ed., Cengage, 2013). Her articles have appeared in Diplomatic History, The Journal of Social History, The Journal of Women&#8217;s History, The New Republic, and elsewhere.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Sewing, knitting, quilting, the crafts related to fabric making, are usually not what we think about when we consider our digital communications devices. Yet, many of the activities that we find ourselves doing with our devices touching the screen, scrolling, swiping, etc. and some of the language that we use to describe our actions, draw from textile culture. In his book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhsIOp4hZH_Xnxgf2O5-L48AAAFikISY0QEAAAFKAb8K4qs/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262037009/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0262037009&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=YO9W9s6BWqiuTUVhIcC0iQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fabric of Interface: Mobile Media, Design, and Gender</a> (MIT Press, 2017), <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/coms/faculty.html?fpid=stephen-monteiro">Stephen Montiero</a>, at Concordia University, explores the connection between the fabric arts and computing. In it he investigates the relationship between gender and the construction of media technologies. A particular focus of his is an examination of how, as in former years sewing was dismissed as women&#8217;s work, social aspects of digital technologies are gendered and dismissed as inconsequential. Montiero also details the eraser of the contributions of many women to the evolution of the technology that is now ubiquitous.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Wade interviews gamers, developers and journalists to better understand the cultural habitus of early gaming. Wade expertly explores the bedroom culture of early coders, examining the ways in which games were copied and distributed among players. He situates gaming in the underground subcultures of arcades, connecting early arcade cultures to present-day gambling and gaming. Wade analyzes the ways that 1980s gaming gave rise to today&#8217;s gaming industry. Through his in-depth research into 1980s British gaming culture, Wade argues that video games give insight into social, political, and cultural landscapes in ways that deserve exploration and recognition. Wade&#8217;s work on gaming and gaming culture is essential reading in games studies and media and his focus on sociology of gaming makes for an appeal to a wide audience.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As Paul Whitfield Horn Professor of Literature and Science at Texas Tech University, <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/english/general_info/directory/faculty_profile_pages/clarke_detailed.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce Clarke</a> has spent the last decade-plus publishing groundbreaking scholarship introducing the application of second-order systems theory to the analysis of literature and media more broadly. The staggering scope of Clarke&#8217;s multidisciplinary erudition is on full display in the monograph, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiMfd500vHBRPOEH6AW3dNYAAAFiOUo4_AEAAAFKATS3CsI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816691029/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0816691029&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=4bbTIJtbp3jox3mpKycZmw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neocybernetics and Narrative</a>, out from University of Minnesota Press in 2014. In picking up Niklas Luhmann&#8217;s neologism &#8220;neocybernetics&#8221; in place of a more standard second-order cybernetic label, Clarke carves out a theoretical continuum for his thinking that runs along a trajectory from Heinz von Foerster&#8217;s notions of the observer, through George Spencer-Brown&#8217;s Laws of Form, Maturana and Varela&#8217;s biology of cognition, and right up to, and including, Niklas Luhmann&#8217;s controversial extension of autopoiesis theory to metabiotic social systems; a theoretical move most often excluded from more orthodox second-order cybernetic thinking. The formidable theoretical apparatus he has assembled allows Clarke to frame the reader of literary texts as an observer of semantic structures facilitating the psychic construction of possible worlds of meaning, and to examine literary texts themselves as forms of communicative action that continue the autopoiesis of meaning-constituted social systems along the lines of Luhmann&#8217;s tripartite process of information, utterance, and understanding. From this launch-pad, Clarke takes us on a stratospheric ride with stops on a variety of fascinating landscapes including the media theory of Friedrich Kittler, the socio-technical explorations of Bruno Latour, and encounters with artistic works as diverse as Virgina Woolf&#8217;s iconic modernist novel, Mrs. Dalloway and James Cameron&#8217;s quasi-Gaian special effects blockbuster motion picture, Avatar. As a result, Clarke has given arts and humanities scholars an entirely new set of tools with which to think about artistic production, reception, and mediation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Thomas Kuhn upset both scientists and philosophers of science when he argued that transitions from one scientific framework (or &#8220;paradigm&#8221;) to another were irrational: the change was like a religious conversion experience rather than a reasoned shift from one theory to another based on the best evidence. But even if one disagrees with Kuhn, how can this change be shown to be rational? More generally, how can transitions from one set of normative standards to another be rational, given that there is no neutral position from which to criticize one&#8217;s own normative standards? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022651451X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Creatively Undecided: Toward a History and Philosophy of Scientific Agency</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017), <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/profile/fisch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Menachem Fisch</a> takes up this challenge, defending an account of framework change which accepts that we cannot be self-critical of our own standards, but we can be destabilized by external criticism. Some of those who are &#8220;ambivalated&#8221; in this way creatively attempt to tackle their ambivalence by developing hybrid theories that provide others in a scientific community with a means to critically assess their frameworks and develop new ones. Fisch, who is Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at Tel Aviv University, draws on work from Korsgaard, Friedman, Galison, McDowell and others in a rich discussion of the dynamics of normativity in science, illustrated with a case study of debates on the foundations of algebra in the 1830s.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On this episode, we will be talking to <a href="https://reading.academia.edu/ANTHIMOSTSIRIGOTIS/CurriculumVitae" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthimos Alexandros Tsirigotis</a> about his book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QtYL6BwNt472HiuY8_nUhhAAAAFh8zGA6wEAAAFKAeP18Jg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/3319508466/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=3319508466&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=.7T64QvQ7rgjPsY7y5FteA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybernetics, Warfare, and Discourse: The Cybernetisation of Warfare in Britain</a> (Palgrave MacMillan, 2017). Given the significant efforts of the field&#8217;s founder, Norbert Wiener, to distance cybernetics from military research and application, as well as the ethical stances of some of the field&#8217;s later leading lights such as Heinz von Foerster, Humberto Maturana, Herbert Brun, Ranulph Glanville and Larry Richards, it should not be surprising if some contemporary cyberneticians might find the particular combination of words in the books title somewhat disconcerting. However, far from producing a strictly first-order technological study or strategic &#8220;how to&#8221; manual, Greek military officer Tsirigotis has carried out a decidedly second-order examination of the subject that supplants the mainstream assumption of cyberspace as a set of technologies with a notion of cyberspace as a set of social practices produced, and reproduced, autopoietically through what he calls &#8220;cyber discourse.&#8221; Grounded in notions of emergence and complexity and employing digital tools of corpus linguistics on policy documents from over the past seven decades, Tsirigotis traces the transformation of such notions as &#8220;security&#8221; and &#8220;threat&#8221; in British military circles. The result is a conception of the state, not as a particular bounded geographical region, but as a network of autopoietic social practices; and of a world in which such states do not seek to extinguish external threats through the deployment of hard military power but rather seek to use their networks to adapt to the constant presence of threats in their environment. Along the way, Tsirigotis provides a striking example of what a truly second-order social science, capable of engaging with all manner of social practices beyond the military sphere, might look like.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[My father has this personality quirk that drives me crazy. Whenever and wherever he travels, no matter how far, he refuses to reset his watch to the local time. For him, it&#8217;s always whatever time it is in Cincinnati, Ohio, even if all the clocks around him flash the fact that it isn&#8217;t, even if he&#8217;s taking my mother, for example, on their once-in-a-lifetime dream vacation to Hawaii and the sun is setting in perfect postcard colors. &#8220;No wonder I&#8217;m sleepy,&#8221; he&#8217;ll say, glancing at his watch. &#8220;It&#8217;s two in the morning.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know quite why it drives me so crazy. Maybe it&#8217;s his small refusal to accept where he is at that moment or maybe its his small insistence that, at any moment, he&#8217;s always home. I just know that, with a wristwatch and a strong will, my father has decided to ignore the laws of time.<br />
It turns out that he&#8217;s not so different from most of us who fly frequently from one time zone to another. In his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhdlDYUPQjTpkQVtT3pjCacAAAFhvZpfdQEAAAFKAYXE0fU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1501323229/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1501323229&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=5z-uSdphdIDGF4OjJuLQkQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jet Lag</a> (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), <a href="https://history.lafayette.edu/people/christopher-lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Lee</a> illuminates what happens to us when, thousands of feet in the air, trapped in an uncomfortable seat in coach or luxuriously sprawled out in first-class, we race ahead of the clock or fall behind it. Suddenly the sun shines when it shouldn&#8217;t or the night comes to soon, and were out of synch, not only with time but, it can seem, with the world around us, even with ourselves. We&#8217;re jet-lagged, and, as Lee cleverly shows, were experiencing much more than an inconvenience. We&#8217;re experiencing something like modernity itself, where time, technology, and our global condition are not only made evident but also, as we stagger off our flights, exhausting.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In this book, Dr. Hart traces the history of automotive transportation in Ghana from the introduction of the first motor vehicles during the early colonial period through the beginnings of the twenty-first century. Ghana on the Go focuses on the emergence and growth of commercial transportation which became the most prevalent way for Ghanaians to experience automotive mobility. Dr. Hart centers her narrative in the personal stories of drivers and passengers to examine how automotive mobility allowed for social and economic mobility building from an existing entrepreneurial culture. She threads these stories with a larger history of political contestation, economic development and state regulation to examine the long-term impact of automotive technology in the evolution of Ghanaian state, society and culture.<br />
Dr. Jennifer Hart is an Associate Professor in the History Department at Wayne State University. Her research interests include African history and Urban History.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For millennia, religions have concocted numerous manifestations of heaven and the afterlife, and though no one has ever returned from such a place to report what it is really like&#8212;or that it even exists&#8212;today science and technology are being used to try to make it happen in our lifetime. In the book we are looking at today, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiTWH5X2NmJ-e0ZWIFY9kJYAAAFhpAXBLwEAAAFKAfiy2wY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1627798579/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1627798579&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=cid5CA.S1k4BiR0ejcorQw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heavens on Earth: The Scientific Search for the Afterlife, Immortality, and Utopia </a>(Henry Holt, 2018), <a href="https://michaelshermer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Michael Shermer</a> sets out to discover what drives humans&#8217; belief in life after death, focusing on recent scientific attempts to achieve immortality along with utopian attempts to create heaven on earth. From radical life extension, to cryonic suspension to mind uploading, Shermer considers how realistic these attempts are from a proper skeptical perspective and concludes with an uplifting tribute to purpose and progress and a word on how we can live well in the here-and-now, whether or not there is a hereafter.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the early twentieth century, Robert Hertz, a French anthropologist, and Cesare Lombroso, the Italian criminologist, debated the causes and consequences of left-handedness. According to Lombroso, left-handed individuals were more likely to be criminals. Hertz disagreed. For him, to restrict left-handedness was to suppress individual expression. In his book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qo1Z7Yi-Kwgz4ujx52xAtzMAAAFhipEldAEAAAFKAVlGzoE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421423332/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1421423332&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=HAN.I.oxROn9kaGpe1z0vQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On the Other Hand: Left Hand, Right Brain, Mental Disorder, and History</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017), <a href="http://history.sdsu.edu/faculty_and_staff/faculty_bios/h_kushner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howard I. Kushner</a> explores the fascinating and circuitous history of left-handedness. By looking at a wide variety of scientific research, as well as the cultural meanings attached to left-handedness, Kushner breaks down the binary between nature and nurture that has characterized most explanations of what some researchers have called non-right-handedness. Ultimately Kushner argues that discrimination against left-handers can be read as a barometer for a given society&#8217;s toleration of diversity.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.rutgers.edu/faculty-directory/307-delbourgo-james" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Delbourgo</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qq2ZAgdMdqcD5QkU1BCaI1IAAAFhe1OQoQEAAAFKAaq_gdA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1846146577/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1846146577&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=fzRHPmeTcNu.WQRt7AACog&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collecting the World: The Life and Curiosity of Hans Sloane</a> (Allen Lane, 2017) tells the fascinatingly complex and controversial story of Hans Sloane, the man whose collection and last will laid the foundation for the British Museum, the first national, free, public museum.<br />
For Delbourgo, Sloane was for far too long an overlooked figure, who knitted together the interests of a rising empire through methods of botany, natural history and medicine. Overshadowed in part by his counterpart Isaac Newton, Sloane&#8217;s life synchronizes with the changes from seventeenth-century England to eighteenth-century Britain. His life and the time are deeply interwoven with slavery and a new world of commerce. It was thanks to this interconnected world and the many intermediaries that Sloane managed to accumulate so many weird and wonderful objects from different places. He collected, catalogued, and exhibited them according to his own belief system, which centered around binaries of enlightenment versus superstition and sober empiricism versus magic.<br />
More than anything, Delbourgo&#8217;s book reveals the complex lives and stories around Hans Sloane&#8217;s collection and the many different peoples, places and stories that are attached to the silent objects, even today. It raises important historical questions about ownership and authorship of public museums, collections and curatorial practices and makes them relevant for us today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a historian I find myself constantly asking the question &#8220;Is that really new, or is it rather something that looks new but isn&#8217;t?&#8221; If you read the headlines, particularly those concerning the on going &#8220;Digital Revolution,&#8221; you would certainly get the impression that a Brave New World is emerging, one nothing like anything that we&#8217;ve seen before. And, in a way, this is true: we&#8212;meaning humans&#8212;have never lived in an environment with smartphones, social media, and the firehose of &#8220;information&#8221; that is the Internet. We&#8217;re always on and always connected in a way we have never been before.<br />
But, as <a href="http://www.ajkeen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Keen</a> points out in his smart new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqTRhnooAy4LX_celvIL6_IAAAFgXFJoTAEAAAFKAQJ0eJk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802126642/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0802126642&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=R7y61kB2zxZs-WbMQBIViA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How To Fix The Future</a> (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2018), there is also a sense in which we have been here before, namely, in the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and 19th century. Then, too, technology and new forms of organization upended the way almost everyone in the industrializing world lived. (For more, see Auguste Comte, Karl Marx, and Emile Durkheim, unless you like poets, in which case you should just read the British Romantics.) Some made dire predictions, others said heaven was around the corner. There was lots of suffering and, well, lots of progress. What we did, Keen points out, is essentially tame the Industrial Revolution such that it served humanity rather than humanity serving it. He says we can do the same with the Digital Revolution, and he tells us how. Listen in.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book is structured around three historical and ethnographic case studies&#8212;the pomp and show at Viceroy Curzon&#8217;s 1903 Imperial Durbar that ultimately left no trace on Delhi&#8217;s physical landscape; Constituent Assembly debates on nationwide electrification legislation; and anti-privatization consumer activism pursued by New Delhi&#8217;s neighborhood associations in the mid 2000s. Coleman argues that technological infrastructures are never a purely technical matter and always already entangled in political, legal and moral processes. Electrification in each historical moment&#8212;colonial enclave, fledgling nation and global city&#8212;generates meaningful, moral reflection on what constitutes the public sphere, self-determination and collective wellbeing.<br />

Spanning 150 years from the origins of telegraphy in the early 1800s to the advent of computing in the 1950s &#8211; the book explores the at times fraught relationship between Chinese writing and global modernity. It covers some of the earliest and varied attempts to make the Chinese script fit for Western communication systems, taking the reader on a journey through Chinese telegraphy, Morse code, typewriters and early computing. In addition, Mullaney includes reference to the many failed attempts, ideas and approaches in the history of Chinese information technology through a series of lively and insightful stories and people. Perhaps most interestingly, Mullaney covers how various inbuilt linguistic inequalities in turn eventually led to the evolution of innovative strategies and technologies, including input method and predictive text.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320843914_Cybernetics_state_of_the_art"></a>It&#8217;s no secret that we continue to live in the midst of digital revolution that continues to unfold in a rapidly accelerating fashion. Digital connectivity and the Internet of Things make possible not only Smart Homes, but Smart Cities. As with all technological revolutions, the road ahead is equally dotted with possibilities and pitfalls. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Liss_Werner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liss C. Werner</a> and her colleagues brought together a collection of thinkers and practitioners in the realms of architecture, design, and urban planning to wrestle with questions around ways we might utilize today&#8217;s digital design tools to enable more responsive, resilient, and ultimately, inclusive and democratic forms of urban design and governance without tipping the balance over to a technocratic project that might imprison us within its algorithmic logics. All of the contributors to this discussion share the hope that the insights of second-order cybernetics might provide valuable guidance as we attempt to find that particular &#8220;sweet-spot&#8221; of human/machine interaction. Their insights are gathered together in Cybernetics: State of the Art edited by our guest, Liss C. Werner, and <a href="https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/6680/3/cybernetics_state_of_the_art_2017.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available free online from the Technical University of Berlin</a>. As editor, Werner has skillfully crafted a dialectic arc that allows the productive tensions between digital utopianism and skepticism enabling a provocative investigation of the revolution that is happening whether we like it or not, and might help us find the means to steer its emergence in ways that are most beneficial for all of us and our environment.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born to immigrant parents, Salk studied hard to graduate for college and earn his medical degree. His interest in helping all of humanity led Salk to pass on a career as a clinician in favor of one as a researcher in the burgeoning field of virology. After work during World War II on the first successful influenza vaccine Salk moved to Pittsburgh, where he soon found himself involved in a coordinated effort to defeat the disease. Salk&#8217;s vaccine became the first to achieve this. Yet as Jacobs demonstrates, the fame Salk won for his achievement came at a price. Though lionized the world over he found himself engaged in a lifelong campaign to prove the superiority of his vaccine, while his efforts to develop vaccines against other diseases never achieved the same degree of success.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Technology is a form of material culture and is a human activity. The way in which humans view technology is a social construction in which people use social processes of interpretation and negotiation. The mundane rituals that humans carry out when interacting with technology are loaded with emotional overtones. The interaction with technology in most cases become habit. The dependence and isolation that result from technology use is invisible and seems natural to membership groups that use it. Chelsea Schelly, the author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqIFQOxp_r_dGVRfDZ8o2N0AAAFgnl6vOQEAAAFKAVh5PaY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/081358650X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=081358650X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=dS8Am8rkPY6ujd9sDVXp8g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwelling in Resistance: Living with Alternative Technologies in America</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2017) and my guest for this episode, studied technology and the way in which people of four alternative lifestyles live without such dependency on technology. In our interview, we discuss the way in which people at The Farm, Twin Oaks, Dancing Rabbits, and Earthship Biotecture lived their daily lives by sharing some technology and living without most of it.<br />
<a href="https://www.mtu.edu/social-sciences/department/faculty/schelly/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea Schelly</a>, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Michigan Technological University in Houghton. Dr. Schelly is also the author of Crafting Collectivity: American Rainbow Gatherings and Alternative Forms of Community. She is currently developing a project to further research the economy of these four communities.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When discussing Internet history, many within the United States believe the creation myth of an Internet born in Silicon Valley. But aspects of the Internet that we use for shopping, financial transactions, and social interactions, among other things, have roots in technological advances from other countries. In particular, 15 years before most Americans were online, the French government backed a communications technology, the Minitel, that revolutionized social, political, and financial interactions. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minitel-Welcome-Internet-Platform-Studies/dp/0262036223">Minitel: Welcome to the Internet</a> (MIT Press, 2017), <a href="http://mediaschool.indiana.edu/profile/?p=mailland">Julien Mailland</a> and <a href="http://kevindriscoll.info/">Kevin Driscoll</a> discuss the creation and spread of the Minitel and the particular influence it had on France, and ultimately what we call the Internet. In so doing the authors offer lessons for current regulatory debates.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We tend to think of ourselves&#8212;our modern selves&#8211;as disenchanted. We have traded magic, myth, and spirits for science, reason, and logic. But this is false. <a href="https://religion.williams.edu/faculty/jason-josephson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Josephson-Storm</a>, in his exciting new book titled <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvqwrL5zMNmesnvNMi_4NvYAAAFgash5zwEAAAFKARlpzFQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022640336X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022640336X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=T137b-Po5HnzDLIgmhiogQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017) challenges this classical story of modernity. Josephson-Storm, associate professor in and chair of the Department of Religion at Williams College, argues that modernity is riddled with magic, and that attempts to curtail it have often failed. Adding a twist to a well-known expression, he writes that we have never been disenchanted. Josephson-Storm investigates the human sciences&#8212;philosophy, psychoanalysis, sociology, and folklore studies, to name a few&#8212;which were critical to the creation and spread of the myth of a mythless society. But the human sciences were themselves also deeply entangled with magic. They often, Josephson-Storm reveals, emerged from occult origins, flirted with the paranormal, or even produced new enchantments. As can be surmised from this brief description, the audience of The Myth of Disenchantment will be a broad and eclectic one. The book will be of interest to scholars in religious studies, science and technology studies, and historians of philosophy, science, ideas, culture, and Europe.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book offers an accessible overview of key psychoanalytic theories to understand the video game, in particular the video game experience and its impact on the social world. The book uses a plethora of gaming examples, drawing out the ambivalences and potentials in even the most seemingly un-revolutionary games. These range from the transformation of space and urban experience in Pokemon Go, through the more corporate or reactionary experiences of Uncharted, through to the subversive elements of Papers Please. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding how we live, through video games, now.<br />

His new book,<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QieIzHgTcSt4kHwoiTjykaoAAAFgVeJEcAEAAAFKAfaQF-w/http://www.amazon.com/dp/144085128X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=144085128X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=e8Svmv01Tz0q7K385V8Twg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Game Worlds Get Real: How Who We Are Online Became Who We Are Offline</a> (Praeger, 2017), takes readers into the world of electronic games and the complex social relationships that they create. With the mainstream reader in mind, it serves as a primer for anyone interested in the how and why of gaming, as well as a solid introduction to social science concepts generally. The book does not presume apologetics for video games&#8212;to be sure, the author takes a direct approach to discussing the myriad social problems inherent in the medium. Along with the many positives to collaborative and competitive online play, major topics include sexism, masculinity, various gamer stigmas, identity formation, and consumption, among others. In this conversation we touch of all of these, as well as the books origins, how the author was able to include student work in the final publication, and his award-winning teaching methods.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Observers feared Germany was becoming &#8220;ungovernable&#8221; and France was moving toward &#8220;civil war.&#8221; The source of this discontent? Nuclear power. Not weapons. Electricity.<br />
How did anti-nuclear protest become a debate about the future of society? What united farmers, housewives, hippies, and anarchists against the state? Find out in our conversation with Andrew S. Tompkins about his new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiJGGuG3cnGM8CLR2UViOnsAAAFf6w1kFAEAAAFKAXQEqPI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198779054/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0198779054&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=cEM.J8LbPv7fAp7tqv0mpA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Better Active than Radioactive!

By weaving government documents and police records with activist newspapers and oral history interviews, Andrew explains how a transnational network of activists emerged around the issue of nuclear power despite social divides and diverse interests inside the movement.<br />

In the post-WWII period of decolonization, experts and state planners in the Global North tested in the real-world the hypotheses of Demographic Transition Theory (industrialization leads to few births which leads to &#8220;better&#8221; lives). In doing so, they repackaged the racist logic of earlier eugenicist definitions of population in the postwar period by harnessing the concept of population, not to environmental limits, but to economic optimization. Murphy show how this postwar &#8220;regime of valuation&#8221; played out on the ground through an extended study of population management and family planning projects in Bangladesh. Murphy&#8217;s work&#8212;which combines a new history of the population concept with an original study of lives lived (and not lived) in Bangladesh&#8212;demonstrates her broader point: namely that seemingly abstract, large scale elements of late-capitalist infrastructures of industrial production depend upon emotional, affective sensibilities about sex and reproduction.<br />
By telling a history of expert concepts of population, the infrastructures that perform it, the affects that pulse through it, and forms of life it continues to produce and prevent, Michelle Murphy invites readers to speculate towards other worlds&#8212;and other words. Murphy teaches us why population is an &#8220;intolerable concept&#8221; and she does the work of imagining other, more just, more apt words we might use in place of &#8220;population.&#8221; She suggests that her term &#8220;distributed reproduction&#8221; might help shift our attention, our thinking, and our practices towards more emancipatory collective responses and responsibilities&#8212;given our own existence as part of infrastructures of racism and violence.<br />

Laura&#8217;s first book, <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo12182576.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behind Closed Doors: IRBs and the Making of Ethical Research</a>, was published in 2012 by University of Chicago Press. Her current research explores how a market for healthy civilian &#8220;human subjects&#8221; emerged in law, science, and popular imagination in the post-World War Two period. It is based on a vernacular archive she created with more than 100 &#8220;normal control&#8221; research subjects and scientists who took part in postwar experiments at the US National Institutes of Health, now archived at Countway Library for the History of Medicine. Overall, Stark&#8217;s work uses social theory to map the intersections of science, morality and the modern state in a global context.<br />

First noticed by colonists in 1680, by the nineteenth century Massachusetts&#8217; Dighton Rock was one of the most famous and contested artifacts of American antiquity. This forty-two ton boulder covered in petroglyphs has been the subject of endless speculation denying its Native American origins. Interpretations have included Vikings, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Lost Tribes of Israel, visitors from Atlantis, ancient Freemasons, and (today) the lost Portuguese explorer, Miguel Corte-Real. Hunter dissects almost four centuries of Dighton Rock&#8217;s misinterpretations to reveal its larger role in the colonization and the conceptualization of Native Americans. This sprawling study brings a fresh perspective to scientific racism, the rise of American archaeology and anthropology, the intellectual weaponry of colonialism, and the construction of migration theories for the peopling of the Americas. By disenfranchising Native Americans from their own past in interpretations of Dighton Rock and related archaeological puzzles such as the Mound Builders, colonizers have sought to answer to their own advantage two fundamental questions: to whom does America belong, and who belongs in America?<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you are an enthusiast of The Cheese and the Worms (1976), The Great Cat Massacre (1984), or The Return of Martin Guerre (1983), then <a href="http://independent.academia.edu/michaelwintroub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Wintroub</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhCY0tjVs10BGcXoMGNiLBoAAAFe4uSx7wEAAAFKARSaGLg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107188237/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1107188237&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wd67aSHuZZd0ZWgJjcymmA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Voyage of Thought: Navigating Knowledge Across the Sixteenth-Century World</a> (<a href="http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/history-science-and-technology/voyage-thought-navigating-knowledge-across-sixteenth-century-world?format=HB#K1XPpyr3HRWZghI9.97" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cambridge University Press</a>, 2017) is a must read. Simply put, this is a book that will lead you down a path of wonder, and possibly, saddle you with a good head scratch. However, no one ever said that an itch near the cranium translates to feeling lousy; in this instance, what we have here is a richly researched and thought-provoking (no pun intended) piece of scholarship.<br />
<a href="http://cstms.berkeley.edu/people/michael-wintroub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wintroub</a>, Professor of Rhetoric at the University of California at Berkeley, is interested in how ideas that are commonplace today (like information-gathering, expertise, confidence, scale, and replication) originated over four centuries ago. This is the story of two brothers who were tasked with a monumental, trail-blazing journey from their home in Dieppe, France all the way to Sumatra. How did two humanist ship captains prepare? What did they find along the way in their search for pepper, glory, and God? Part science, part poetry, part architecture, part mind job, this book probes the notion that physical and mental spaces can be traversed if we ask the right questions.<br />
Furthermore, through a connected history that cleverly interprets a letter from an eighty-year-old sailor, snatches the magnifying glass to reconstruct events on a beach in the Indian Ocean, focuses the microscope on a frieze in France, and backs the telescope off from the inner workings of the astrolabe, in this installment of <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/science-technology/science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in Science</a> you are in for a tour that will enliven the senses and tug on the heart.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For the first time, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qhll0tSg90Dd74wG_741njcAAAFez0D5HgEAAAFKAXZP0h4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804792755/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0804792755&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=XlchBEET5A7aUadQSG.GzQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">African Americans Against the Bomb: Nuclear Weapons, Colonialism, and the Black Freedom Movement</a> (<a href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanford University Press</a>, 2015) tells the compelling story of those black activists who fought for nuclear disarmament by connecting the nuclear issue with the fight for racial equality. Early on, blacks in America saw the use of atomic bombs as a racial issue, asking why such enormous resources were being spent building nuclear arms instead of being used to improve impoverished communities. Black activists&#8217; fears that race played a role in the decision to deploy atomic bombs only increased when the U.S. threatened to use nuclear weapons in Korea in the 1950s and Vietnam a decade later. For some, the nuclear issue was connected to colonialism the U.S. obtained uranium ore used to produce fissile material from the Belgian controlled Congo and the French tested their nuclear weapons in the Sahara.<br />
By expanding traditional research in the history of the nuclear disarmament movement the author reveals the links between the black freedom movement in America and issues of global peace. From Langston Hughes through Lorraine Hansberry to President Obama, African Americans Against the Bomb offers an eye-opening account of the continuous involvement of African Americans who recognized that the rise of nuclear weapons was a threat to the civil rights of all people.<br />
Author <a href="https://twitter.com/VincentIntondi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Intondi</a> is an <a href="https://cms.montgomerycollege.edu/EDU/Department2.aspx?id=66442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associate Professor of History</a> and Director of the Institute for Race, Justice, and Community Engagement at Montgomery College, and formerly the Director of Research for American University&#8217;s Nuclear Studies Institute. His academic research focuses on the intersection of race and nuclear weapons. In 2016, Intondi began working with the Union of Concerned Scientists exploring new efforts to expand the nuclear disarmament movement to include more diverse voices, specifically from the black community. Beyond African Americans Against the Bomb, Intondi is currently working on a new book project, which will examine the famous June 12, 1982 nuclear disarmament march in New York City.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since its infancy, television has played an important role in shaping U.S. values and the American sense of self. Social activists recognized this power immediately and, consequently, set about trying to influence television&#8217;s portrayal of those values by securing access to and a voice in the medium. <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu//profile.cfm?faculty_id=5878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison Perlman</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuSu-EECR3uBzE2eR1xOFhcAAAFeYf-GAgEAAAFKAZOZhbU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813572290/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0813572290&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=gy6Tus.iDp777ejBtA19-A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Interests: Media Advocacy and Struggles Over U.S. Television</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2016) examines some these efforts, including those among African Americans, women, and parents among others, between the 1940s and the early 2000s. Perlman, an associate professor of film and media students and history at the University of California, Irvine, thus, shows that media law and regulation was an important site of debate and activism. Social activists recognized television&#8217;s power and that ensuring their own views, voices, and identities were represented on the screen could be influential in promoting their cause. Both conservative and liberal activists worked hard to use existing laws to shape television ownership and programing. In the process, activists also worked to shape the definition of the public and weighed in on questions surrounding how to define and promote the &#8220;public interest,&#8221; as required by law. By the 1980s, deregulation reshaped the landscape, but did not end the importance of the arena for activists.<br />
In this episode of New Books in History, Perlman discusses Public Interests and this history of media advocacy. She tells listeners about some of these social activists&#8217; campaigns to influence FCC policies nationally as well as about more localized efforts to shape television programing. She also explains why these battles were important in shaping the broadcasting environment even if they did not always achieve their stated goal. She discusses the importance of deregulation in later media regulation advocacy. Perlman makes clear that a simple declension story is inaccurate even in this later period and discusses these battles&#8217; continued relevance today.<br />

A seemingly profound, yet totally ridiculous question to try and answer. Yet, when Oxford University Press reached out to the brilliant scholar of Victorian science, <a href="https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/history/staff-profiles/listing/profile/irm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Iwan Rhys Morris</a>, they were tapping the right man for the job on the shoulder. He designed, contributed, and edited <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QtcidIWTD0ojMprWR5I5d6sAAAFeSbft3QEAAAFKAb8QikI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199663270/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0199663270&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Gm91CcSGuCYmABaZf828CA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Oxford Illustrated History of Science </a>(Oxford University Press, 2017) which was published earlier this year. He assembled an all-star team of specialists with backgrounds in a variety fields in this history of science. His simple yet complex answer to the question I just posed is: science is humanity. Without humanity, there would be no science. No Newton, no Darwin, and no Dr. Who. This book is both conventional and not, sweeping yet focused, and really fun to read as both a reference source and as a piece of world history. Join me, J.N. Campbell and for podcasts to come, my colleague Steve Rooney, as we host new segments for New Books in Science. We will ask probing questions, and of course, we hope you enjoy our rapid fire installment at the end! Here is the first installment with my guest, Iwan Morris. Enjoy!<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Widespread human alteration of the planet has led many scholars to claim that we have entered a new epoch in geological time: the Anthropocene, an age dominated by humanity. This ethnography is the first to directly engage the Anthropocene, tackling its problems and paradoxes from the vantage point of the world&#8217;s largest tropical rainforest.<br />
Drawing from extensive ethnographic research, <a href="https://anthropology.osu.edu/people/kawa.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nicholas C. Kawa</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/147730844X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazonia in the Anthropocene: People, Soils, Plants, Forests</a> (<a href="https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/kawa-amazonia-in-the-anthropocene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas Press</a>, 2016) examines how pre-Columbian Amerindians and contemporary rural Amazonians have shaped their environment, describing in vivid detail their use and management of the region&#8217;s soils, plants, and forests. At the same time, <a href="https://nicholaskawa.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kawa</a> highlights the ways in which the Amazonian environment resists human manipulation and control&#8211;a vital reminder in this time of perceived human dominance. Written in engaging, accessible prose, Amazonia in the Anthropocene offers an innovative contribution to debates about humanity&#8217;s place on the planet, encouraging deeper ecocentric thinking and a more inclusive vision of ecology for the future.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As I was reading <a href="https://hyenaswine.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Edward&#8217;s</a> fascinating and far-reaching new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190212098/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Edge of Evolution: Animality, Inhumanity, and Doctor Moreau</a> (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-edge-of-evolution-9780190212094?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2016), I had a flashback. I must have been about seven. I was watching a film adaptation of H.G. Well&#8217;s classic work of science fiction, The Island of Doctor Moreau. It&#8217;s about a doctor who takes animals and tries to make them human by surgically alerting them. I don&#8217;t remember much about the movie&#8211;I think Burt Lancaster played Moreau&#8211;but what I remember is that the story really creeped me out. It stayed with me for a long time. And, even now, as I remember those half-man, half-beasts that populate Dr. Moreau&#8217;s island, I&#8217;m creeped out. The feeling is something like a primordial shiver. Now you may attribute that feeling to the sensitivity of a seven-year-old, and that&#8217;s probably right: what were my parents thinking letting me watch a horror movie at that age? Edwards, however, has a different answer, one based on Well&#8217;s original story. It&#8217;s that these man-beasts that Wells imagines force us to realize us that we are, in our essence, animals. This realization is something that, as a culture and as individuals, we don&#8217;t like to contemplate. It unnerves us. It creeps us out. And that&#8217;s what Edward&#8217;s book explores: it is, among other things, a case against human exceptionalism, one that asks us not only to rethink our animal selves, but also our relationship to those other creatures who share our animality.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today &#8220;The Fens&#8221; is largely a misnomer, as the area of eastern England is now largely flat, dry farmland. Until the early modern era, however, it was a region of wetland marshes. <a href="https://clasprofiles.wayne.edu/profile/ao0103" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Ash</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/142142200X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Draining of the Fens: Projectors, Popular Politics, and State Building in Early Modern England</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017) describes how The Fens was transformed into the environment we know it as today. As Ash explains, the marshes supported a population that took advantage of the lush grasses produced by the regular flooding to engage in animal husbandry, with flood control managed locally through appointed commissions of sewers. In the late 16th century, however, a combination of environmental change and political shifts led the royal government to support proposals for large-scale drainage projects that would turn the wetlands into farmlands. Though the plans&#8217; advocates argued that drainage would improve the value of the lands in the region, the locals resisted such efforts to disrupt their ways of life through a variety of legal and extralegal means. In response the crown moved from efforts to develop consensus for the plans to asserting royal authority in environmental management in order to start the projects, beginning by the 1620s the first of a series of efforts that over the course of the next half-century drained many of the fens in the region.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book outlines the core theoretical concepts, such as neo-liberalism, bio-power, and bio-politics, alongside the characteristics themes of metric power, including practices of making (in)visible, the social life of methods and data, and questions of agency. These theoretical discussions are set against the broad backdrop of the rise of big data, corporate power, social media, and algorithm based decision making. Metric Power is located within the study of broader social inequalities, meaning the book makes important reading for anyone concerned with how our daily experiences of technologies, organisations, and social institutions, are shaped, unequally, by the power of metrics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Before the 1960s, doctors were generally in control of the treatment of drug addicts. And that made a certain sense, because drug addicts had something that looked a lot like a disease or mental illness. The trouble was that doctors had no effective way to treat drug addiction. Their best idea&#8211;Federal &#8220;narcotics farms,&#8221; one in Kentucky and one in Texas&#8211;kept junkies clean, but only by keeping them away from the drugs those junkies craved. In that sense, they were no more effective than prisons, though in fairness drug farms offered various treatment regimens that enabled some addicts to get and stay clean. Other than locking them up, the medical establishment had no good answer to the question &#8220;How do you cure someone of narcotics addiction?&#8221; Essentially, then, junkies (who could not spontaneously &#8220;kick,&#8221; and a lot do) usually ended up in one of three places: on the street, behind bars, or dead.<br />
Enter Charles Dederich. In 1958, Dederich, a veteran of AA and ex-drug addict, decided that addicts should take their treatment into their own hands, much like Bill Wilson and Bob Smith had done with AA in the late 1930s. He took what he learned in AA, adapted it, and created a long-term residential &#8220;therapeutic community&#8221; expressly for addicts and run by addicts. He called it Synanon, and with it he started what <a href="http://www.clairedclark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire D. Clark</a> calls &#8220;the recovery revolution.&#8221;<br />
In her terrific book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231176384/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Recovery Revolution: The Battle Over Addiction Treatment in the United States</a> (Columbia University Press, 2017), Clark tells the story of Dederich and those who followed him (literally and chronologically) in trying to find a way to treat narcotics addiction. It&#8217;s a tale of ebbs and flows, successes and failures, enthusiasm and exhaustion lasting sixty years. Clark makes clear that the &#8220;recovery revolution&#8221; is not over by any means&#8211;we are still groping toward a good answer to the question &#8220;How do you cure someone of narcotics addiction?&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Simone Muller&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231174322/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wiring the World: The Social and Cultural Creation of Global Telegraph Networks</a> (Columbia University Press, 2016) is a superb account of the laying of submarine telegraph cables in the nineteenth century and the battles over them in the subsequent decades. Her book shows how expanding telegraph networks were instrumental in processes of capitalism, nation-building, and globalization. To track these grand developments, however, Muller reconstructs the network of people who built, managed, and fought over telegraph networks. She calls this eclectic collection of financiers, engineers, entrepreneurs, and politicians &#8220;actors of globalization.&#8221;<br />
Muller&#8217;s book is an historical kaleidoscope that shows the multi-faceted meaning of telegraphy. Her actors imbued telegraphy with hopes of world peace, of Weltcommunication (a predecessor of the global village idea), of a global electric union, and of bolstering the civilizing mission. Even if submarine telegraphy never achieved these aspirations, her book demonstrates just how culturally and socially significant this technology and these networks were to the pre-WWI world.<br />
Her book should be of interest to historians of capitalism, technology, international relations, Europe and the United States, along with anyone curious about the longer duree of globalization. <a href="http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/staff_fellows/programs-and-projects/mueller_simone1/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone Muller</a> is a principal investigator at the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.<br />

Dexter Fergie will be pursuing his PhD in US and Global history at Northwestern University in September 2017.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In May, a tunnel filled with radioactive waste collapsed at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, making international news. This incident highlighted the costs and challenges of cleaning up this deactivated nuclear facility, once America&#8217;s largest producer of plutonium for atomic weapons, including the Nagasaki bomb. The U.S. government spends around $2 billion a year on cleanup efforts at Hanford, which have been the sole focus at the site since its reactors were shut down at the end of the Cold War. Melvin R. Adams was one of the first environmental engineers hired at Hanford as part of a small team focused on environmental issues. Beginning in 1979, his 24-year career at Hanford progressed alongside increasing government investment in more responsible management of nuclear waste and its disposal. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0874223415/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Geography: A Personal History of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation</a> (Washington State University Press, 2016) Adams recounts engineering efforts to mitigate and control radioactive contamination and offers amusing anecdotes of the characters tasked with cleaning up the most contaminated nuclear waste site in the U.S. He also captures the paradox of Hanford, an artifact of the atomic age surrounded (and sometimes invaded by) wild terrain, natural beauty, and flourishing biodiversity. Atomic Geography offers personal and poetic insight into a complex, contested landscape.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What better way to explore the history of media regulation than to go on a journey with the former chief economist of the FCC? Prior to introduction of the Federal Radio Commission in 1927, the radio spectrum was in chaos. Broadcasters were attempting to drown out their rivals with powerful signals and the detrimental effect on the public interest was profound. Or was it?<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300210507/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Political Spectrum: The Tumultuous Liberation of Wireless Technology, from Herbert Hoover to the Smartphone</a> (Yale University Press, 2017), distinguished legal and economic scholar <a href="https://www.thomashazlett.com/buy-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Hazlett</a> challenges the notion that U.S. government intervention was vital to protect and save the industry. Hazlett argues that, for nearly a century, disruptive technologies, competition and alternative viewpoints have been quashed, by special interest groups claiming to know better. Hazlett blends his discussion on legislation with the rise of new technologies in a way that in accessible to everyone, even if you have no prior knowledge of media policy and the current landscape. This entertaining and fascinating read argues that, if you really want to achieve what is best for the public, you need to open the market to more competition.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Brian Clegg is one of England&#8217;s most prolific and popular writers on science. His latest work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1785782088/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Reality Frame: Relativity and Our Place in the Universe </a>(Icon Books, 2017), covers Einstein&#8217;s Theories of Relativity and a whole lot more. Simply as an exposition of Einstein&#8217;s theories, the book is excellent its beautifully organized and delivered, with Clegg&#8217;s usual clarity and insight. But what makes the book transcend the usual work on this subject is that Clegg looks at relativity as a concept that can help us understand what distinguishes humanity as a species, and where our species fits into the Universe. Einstein himself would have enjoyed participating in a discussion of this fascinating topic, and may well have shared some of Clegg&#8217;s points of view.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the summer of 1969, two seminal events of the sixties happened within a few weeks of each other: the first man walked on the moon and the Woodstock music festival was held in upstate New York. At first glance, these two events might appear to have little to do with one another. But in his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/067497199X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apollo in the Age of Aquarius </a>(Harvard University Press, 2017), Neil Maher examines the often contentious relationship between the NASA-led space program and the social movements of the era.<br />
Maher shows that civil rights activists questioned why the U.S. federal government spent billions on space exploration while many African Americans suffered in poverty and lived in dilapidated housing in the nation&#8217;s cities. He explains why New Left activists and environmentalists opposed NASA&#8217;s emphasis on big technology and the agency&#8217;s involvement with the military in Vietnam. And he describes how hippies with the counterculture rejected NASA&#8217;s techno-optimism and moved to communes to practice simpler living using smaller, appropriate technology.<br />
<a href="http://www.neilmaher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Maher</a> is associate professor of history at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and author of a previous book, Nature&#8217;s New Deal: The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Rise of the American Environmental Movement (Oxford University Press).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Wilson,_Robert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Wilson</a> is an associate professor in the Department of Geography, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. His research interests include historical geography and environmental history, animal studies, and climate change politics and activism. Wilson also teaches Writing Geography, a graduate seminar that introduces students to storytelling, creative nonfiction, and how to employ these techniques in theses, articles, and books.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Traversing the archives of early African American literature, performance, and visual culture, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1479847666/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fugitive Science: Empiricism and Freedom in Early African American Culture </a>(<a href="https://nyupress.org/books/9781479847662/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New York University Press</a>, 2017), uncovers the dynamic experiments of a group of black writers, artists, and performers. The author chronicles a little-known story about race and science in America. While the history of scientific racism in the nineteenth century has been well-documented, there was also a counter-movement of African Americans who worked to refute its claims.<br />
Far from rejecting science, these figures were careful readers of antebellum science who linked diverse fields&#8211;from astronomy to physiology&#8211;to both on-the-ground activism and more speculative forms of knowledge creation. Routinely excluded from institutions of scientific learning and training, they transformed cultural spaces like the page, the stage, the parlor, and even the pulpit into laboratories of knowledge and experimentation. From the recovery of neglected figures like Robert Benjamin Lewis, Hosea Easton, and Sarah Mapps Douglass, to new accounts of Martin Delany, Henry Box Brown, and Frederick Douglass, Fugitive Science makes natural science central to how we understand the origins and development of African American literature and culture.<br />
<a href="https://www.umass.edu/afroam/member/britt-rusert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Britt Rusert</a> received her Ph.D. in English and certificate in Feminist Studies from Duke University. Her research and teaching focus on African American literature, American literatures to 1900, speculative fiction, the history of race and science, U.S. print cultures, and critical theory. She is currently working on a book-length research study of William J. Wilson&#8217;s &#8220;Afric-American Picture Gallery,&#8221; a text that imagines the first museum of black art in the United States. She is also editing W.E.B. Du Bois short genre fiction with scholar Adrienne Brown. Their edition of W.E.B. Du Bois&#8217; fantasy story, &#8220;The Princess Steel,&#8221; was recently published in PMLA, the journal of Modern Language Association of America. Fugitive Science: Empiricism and Freedom in Early African American Culture is her first book.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.asc.upenn.edu/node/622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sharrona Pearl</a>&#8216;s new book is an absolute pleasure to read. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022646136X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Face/On: Face Transplants and the Ethics of the Other </a>(The University of Chicago Press, 2017) looks closely at facial allotransplantations (FAT), commonly known as face transplants, in order to offer a careful and fascinating study of the stakes for changing the face, and the changing stakes for the face. Troubling the indexical relationship between the face and character and reminding us that &#8220;[t]he self has always been a set of choices,&#8221; Pearl explores face transplantation as it relates to cosmetic surgery and whole-organ transplants, the cinema of the 1960s, television shows, and more. She carefully and sensitively takes us into the debates among surgeons, bioethicists, and journalists that circled the first partial face transplant of Isabelle Dinoire in 2005, and offers a way toward a philosophical approach that brings together Levinas with the kind of (Deleuzian) subjectivity that allows for individuality through constant change and understands the self to be constantly in a process of becoming. The final chapter of the book also situates the analysis within larger contexts of online subjectivities and work with facial and bodily manipulation by artists and performers. It&#8217;s sparklingly written and well worth a read!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Policymakers and the public clamored for maps throughout the first half of the twentieth century. Indeed, maps were a necessity for war, navigation, and countless other activities. Yet by the 1960s and 1970s, interest in maps waned while electronic coordinate systems emerged. But this was not solely a shift in technology, as William Rankin writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022633936X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">After the Map: Cartography, Navigation, and the Transformation of Territory in the Twentieth Century</a> (<a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo22655244.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Chicago Press</a>, 2016). The shift from maps to coordinate systems, and then eventually to GPS produced novel geographical subjectivities, navigational experiences and geopolitical arrangements. It was a shift in the meaning of territory itself.<br />
By day, <a href="http://history.yale.edu/people/william-rankin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Rankin</a> is an assistant professor of history at Yale; by night, he is an award-winning cartographer, whose work you can find <a href="http://www.radicalcartography.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Rankin has also set up a <a href="http://www.afterthemap.info/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a> to accompany the book, at which readers can see the books images, data, and bibliography.<br />
<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Growing up in a geodesic dome is not a claim everyone can make, but author <a href="http://www.katedaloz.com/">Kate Daloz</a> can. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1610392256/?tag=newbooinhis-20">We Are As Gods: Back to the Land in the 1970s on a Quest for a New America</a> (PublicAffairs, 2016) traces the path taken by many children of suburbia in the 1960s across the country who, like her parents, wanted to return to the land. Her subjects are Judy and Larry (her parents), the place they moved to, and the community they helped found.<br />
One of many interesting discoveries in this book is the fact that the back to the land movement took place around the country, within the same demographic, and during the same two-to three-year period in the 1970s.<br />
The causes? One was the growing concern with pollution described in Rachel Carson&#8217;s Silent Spring (1962). Another, which deserves fuller examination, is the apocalyptic mood stemming from the atomic threat of the 1960s. Baby boomers remember, with no small amount of incredulity, schoolroom bomb practice (&#8220;How would going under my desk protect me?&#8221;).<br />
The answers that adults had were not reassuring, or they were naive. The younger generation felt imperiled, and adults were responsible. Cities weren&#8217;t safe either. By returning to the land, a person could face an uncertain future in a community of like-minded people, in home they had built themselves and that expressed their values.<br />
So move this group did, but not all to become hippies. Some formed communes that rejected middle class baggage (monogamy, capitalism, child rearing). Others had advanced degrees, found professional work, and considered themselves &#8220;square.&#8221; Live in a rural setting and you adopt rural culture: community barn raising (even if it is a geodesic dome), self-generated work (Christmas trees farms, organic produce), shared resources.<br />
The author shows that the effects of these communities since the 1970s have permeated throughout American culture. A new kind of fresh food market like Whole Foods and community food co-ops got their starts in such settings. So did recycling (a mainstay of farming culture). Whatever the circumstances that brought them into being, the results have reached far beyond their boundaries and continue to expand our lives.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/sophia-roosth">Sophia Roosth</a>&#8216;s wonderful new book follows researchers clustered around MIT beginning in 2003 who named themselves synthetic biologists. A historically informed anthropological analysis based on many years of ethnographic work, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022644046X/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Synthetic: How Life Got Made</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017) offers a fascinating account of the changing relationship between making and understanding in the life sciences, and of the metamorphoses of life itself as an analytic object. The chapters of the book consider traditional ethnographic conventions as they manifest in the case of synthetic biology and reflect the forms of life being built by the synthetic biologists: religion, kinship, economy and property, labor, household, origin tales. Interludes between the chapters function as keyword entries, each probing earlier articulations of what it meant to be synthetic in different contexts, from the synthetic fabrics industry to Soviet synthetic dance to music, chemistry, and much more. It is a beautifully written and totally absorbing study.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Fueling his bohemian lifestyle and anti-authoritarian attitude with a steady diet of ice cream and whiskey, along with a healthy dose of insomnia, Warren Sturgis McCulloch is best known for his foundational contributions to cybernetics but led a career that spanned psychiatry, philosophy, neurophysiology, and engineering. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/arts/history/people/tara-abraham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara H. Abraham</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/026203509X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebel Genius: Warren S. McCulloch&#8217;s Transdisciplinary Life in Science</a> (MIT Press, 2016) is the first scholarly biography of this towering figure of twentieth century American science. Abrahams careful tracing of McCulloch&#8217;s broad disciplinary traverses is grounded in explication of heady theories and mathematical models of the brain. The growing historical scholarship on cybernetics rests on a curious threshold: its subject matter, rife with outsized personalities and uncannily forward-looking ideas, is ever poised to remain more ineluctably fascinating than scholarly analysis can render. Rather than attempting to beat the cyberneticians at their own game&#8211;self-consciously or not becoming participant observers in the reflexive system described by &#8220;second-order&#8221; cybernetics&#8211;this rich portrait offers pointed and entertaining insight into the role of style, sociability, and mentorship in twentieth century scientific life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Nowadays, it might seem perplexing for the founder of a seed company to express the intention to &#8220;shock Mother Nature,&#8221; or at least in bad taste. Yet, this was precisely the goal of agricultural innovators like David Burpee, of the Burpee Seed Company, who sought to use radiation and chemical mutagens to accelerate the generation of new plant varieties, a process otherwise requiring painstaking, slow, and resource-intensive artificial selection. <a href="http://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/curry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helen Anne Curry</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022639008X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution Made to Order: Plant Breeding and Technological Innovation in Twentieth-Century America</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016) is a fascinating history of biotechnology that documents the interplay between genetic research and agricultural production; genetic engineering avant la lettre, one is tempted to say, although botanist A. F. Blakeslee, who figures prominently in the narrative, made a failed attempt to promote the designation &#8220;genetics engineer&#8221; to describe his work. Through the lens of three different technologies&#8211;x-rays, the chemical colchicine, and atomic radiation&#8211;Curry shows how chromosomes and genetic mutations became sites of speculation for industrial agriculture and of experimentation for amateur plant breeders. She deftly restores the experimental station, the marketplace, and the garden to their proper place as sites of knowledge production, showing that landscape and lab were perhaps never so separable as our modern conceit might make them appear.<br />
This is part one of a series of new work on twentieth-century biotechnology&#8211;look out for further interviews featuring some great new work published by the University of Chicago Press.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What kind of object is a planet? <a href="http://www.lisamesseri.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Messeri</a>&#8216;s new book asks and addressed this question in a fascinating ethnography that explores how scientific practices transform planets into places and helps us understand why that matters not just for how we understand outer space, but also for how we understand the Earth and ourselves. Based on 15 months of participant observation in 2009 and 2010 that included interviews, involvement in research projects, conferences, email exchanges, informal chats, and more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822362031/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Placing Outer Space: An Earthly Ethnography of Other Worlds </a>(Duke University Press, 2016) guides readers through four different field sites in order to analyze the significance of four different activities of place-making therein: narrating, mapping, visualizing, and inhabiting. As we move from the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) in Utah (where Earth itself is transformed into a Martian place) to the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley, to exoplanetary research at MIT, to Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) in Chile, and more, we come to see how geological, digital, pedagogical, observational, and other tools help shape how we understand Mars, exoplanets, and the earth itself. It&#8217;s a fascinating study that will be of wide interest!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The back cover of <a href="https://canes.wisc.edu/jc-mckeown.htm">J. C. McKeown</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190610433/?tag=newbooinhis-20">A Cabinet of Ancient Medical Curiosities</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017), is adorned not with review quotes from contemporary scholars, but rather the discordant voices of the medical writers he excerpts. Speaking of Galen, Photius of Constantinople notes that the author tends to overload his writings with irrelevancies and digressions. Aristotle offers a characteristic caution, urging no one can become a doctor by reading books. These statements intimate the overall style and aims of this entertaining book: to approach the culture of antiquity through medical practice and belief. Though McKeown deliberately goes after the uncanny in selecting his excerpts to translate, one gets an overall impression of medicines remarkable continuity. Class, gender, and race were battlegrounds of medical legitimacy as much as they are now, and contemporary suspicion of medical advances was potent as ever. McKeown opts for evocation rather than scholarly interpretation of the medical cultures of antiquity, making this book entertaining reading for anyone interested in medicine&#8217;s long history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Readers follow von Frisch from his early intimate connection with a small Brazilian parakeet that lived with the family while von Frisch was a boy, to his work on the sensory powers of fish and bees, to his work on bee communication and beyond. Munz introduces us not just to von Frisch&#8217;s texts, lectures, and experiments, but also to his work making films and his struggles to live and work under Nazi power.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Apartheid in South Africa formally ended in 1994, but the issue of poverty and what to do about it remained as contentious as it had been a century earlier. In the new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521198755/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Poverty Knowledge in South Africa: A Social History of Human Science, 1855-2005</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2015), <a href="https://qc-cuny.academia.edu/GraceDavie">Grace Davie</a> shows that the poverty question was up for grabs even into the twenty-first century because of ongoing disagreements about how to measure poverty and to manage the racists assumptions that underwrote it. The book uses the idiom of co-production to show how scientists, activists and other knowledge-makers made and remade poverty in dynamic interaction with the people they sought to know. The book documents the thwarted efforts of scientists to accomplish their political goals as their expert knowledge was variously invoked, reinterpreted, and dismissed not only by white-supremacist governments, but also by social activists, black communities, and labor unions, which all used experts poverty knowledge for their own political ends. At issue was the question of what constituted credible evidence, and over more than a century debates continued to toggle between quantitative and qualitative forms of evidence, between statistics and stories. Through this analysis, Davie pushes back against the familiar claim that the technocratic state was on a steady march towards quantitative objectivity. Poverty Knowledge in South Africa is a serious, thorough book and it is indispensable for thinking through questions of social justice not only among historical actors but among scholars in the present day.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Using the stories of college students she interviewed as a framework, Freitas builds a dynamic argument and offers concrete tools for how teachers, parents, and society as a whole can help young people take control of their smartphones and of their own happiness.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://sociology.missouri.edu/people/prasada">Amit Prasad</a> is widely admired for using Postcolonial Studies to explore questions about science, technology and medicine. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262026953/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Imperial Technoscience: Transnational Histories of MRI in the United States, Britain, and India</a> (MIT, 2014), Prasad looks at the linked histories of MRI research and development in India, UK, the USA to show how the patterns of exclusions created by imperialism continue to shape the topography of high-tech medicine. Pushing back against diffusion of science narratives, Prasad shows how the current story of the West (read: USA) as the center of MRI research and development was far from inevitable. The story was retrospectively, collectively created and has had the effect of obscuring the importance of transnational networks, idiosyncratic federal laws, corporate investments, and everyday habits of imagination in the production of medical technology. Prasad himself resists simple dichotomies because, as he writes, &#8220;The issue here is not simply the elision of the history of science in the non-West or its entrapment in within Eurocentric temporarily, but the very categories that the history of science takes as its objects of inquiry (80).&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What did sound mean to French people as radio and other listening technologies began to proliferate in the early twentieth century? What was the nature and significance of French auditory culture in the years between the two world wars? These are two of the central questions that <a href="https://www.rit.edu/cla/socanthro/ings-core-faculty-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebecca Scales</a> pursues in her new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107108675/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Radio and the Politics of Sound in Interwar France, 1921-1939</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2016). This is not a book focused on the institutional history or content of French radio during this period, however. Rather, Scales examines closely a range of ideas about sound and the development of what she calls the &#8220;radio nation,&#8221; a space of listening, cultural identity, and citizenship. Access to the airwaves, the &#8220;right to listen,&#8221; and the question of whether radio did or did not reflect the nation and its different members became vital areas of discussion and debate in the 1920 and 30s.<br />
Radio and the Politics&#8230;explores the dynamic history of radio at a critical juncture in modern French political and cultural history. Its chapters explore the perspectives of sound producers and consumers, including broadcasters, politicians, educators, medical professionals, radio amateurs, disabled veterans, and a variety of other listeners throughout France. The book considers the broad space of the radio soundscape from Paris to the provinces, and the movement of sound waves beyond/across the borders of &#8220;metropolitan&#8221; France, in Algeria, and to and from other nations. Along the way, the book delves into a range of themes: postwar recovery, class and political differences, the relationship of individual bodies to the national body, tensions between public and private spaces and interests, and state control and surveillance. At once a history of the senses and technology, of French politics, culture and everyday life, this compelling book will be of great interest to readers (and listeners!) across multiple fields.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Alcoholism is a strange thing. That it exists, no one seriously doubts. But it&#8217;s not entirely clear (diagnostically speaking) what it is, who has it, how they get it, or how to treat it. The answers to these questions depend, apparently, on where you are, which is to say what culture you were born and raise in. Alcoholism and treatments for it in Country A might be very different from alcoholism and treatments for it in countries B, C, and D. Alcoholism is, well, relative.<br />
This is one of the many thing I learned from reading <a href="https://humdev.uchicago.edu/directory/eugene-raikhel">Eugene Raikhel</a>&#8216;s fascinating book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1501703137/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Governing Habits: Treating Alcoholism in the Post-Soviet Clinic</a> (Cornell University Press, 2016). An anthropologist, Raikhel tells us the tale  of how the Soviet discipline of &#8220;narcology&#8221;&#8211;the diagnosis and treatment of addiction&#8211; evolved during Soviet times and how it adapted after the USSR fell. I won&#8217;t spoil the story for you, but suffice it to say that Russians treated and continue to treat alcoholism quite differently that we do in the U.S., though that&#8217;s changing (AA has arrived in Russia, something we also discuss). Listen in.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

It looks carefully at the crucial ways that changing notions of visibility set Kepler&#8217;s optics up as the cornerstone to his radical Copernican astronomy as Kepler made three moves that helped him bridge the visual gap between the heavens and its observers: (1) He defined light as a mathematical body, (2) He showed how instruments of observation could be manipulated mathematically to achieve exact representation of distant and almost invisible heavenly occurrences, and (3) He helped develop a new language for scientific observation by reformulating the relationship of mathematics to phenomena. In the course of his elegant analysis of how and why this all played out, Chen-Morris also guides readers through the relationships between Kepler&#8217;s ideas, Shakespeare&#8217;s writings, Renaissance painting, and more. Its a fascinating book.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What makes for new science? What happens to the evidentiary basis of the medical profession when patients demand treatments beyond the range of their conception of human biology? Are the criteria of the sciences amenable to healing practices that are touted for their focus on singularity, rather than uniformity? <a href="http://www.colleenderkatch.com/" target="_blank">Colleen Derkatch</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022634584X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Bounding Biomedicine: Evidence and Rhetoric in the New Science of Alternative Medicine</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016) investigates how boundaries between traditional and novel are erected at the level of medical rhetoric.<br />
Derkatch analyzes both expert and popular literature on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), an umbrella term designed to encompass homeopathy, meditation, naturopathy, and traditional Chinese medicine, among other things. Demand for alternative treatments by patients has produced an uncertain situation in which clinical frameworks are used for practices traditionally seen as being outside the realm of biomedicine. Through concerted engagement with different genres of medical communication, Derkatch&#8217;s rhetorical cultural approach allows the reader to see the extent to which the boundaries of what counts as biomedicine or not rest on conceptions of evidence and categorization schemes promoted by allopathic medical professionals. With a keen eye turned to communication strategies and assumptions, Derkatch shows the subtle ways in which the norms of biomedicine are challenged and strengthened by attempts to reduce other treatments to processes that can be evaluated on the basis of standards of evidence and efficacy.<br />
This is the second of a pair of interviews on alternative medicine: for a historical consideration of naturopathy as an alternative to allopathic medicine, look out for <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/susan-e-cayleff-natures-path-a-history-of-naturopathic-healing-in-america-johns-hopkins-up-2016/" target="_blank">my interview with Susan Cayleff </a>on her book, Nature&#8217;s Path.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How did gender relations change in the computing industry? And how did the UK go from leading the world to having an all but extinct computer industry by the 1970s? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262035545/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Programmed Inequality: How Britain Discarded Women Technologists and Lost Its Edge in Computing</a> (MIT Press, 2017). <a href="http://mariehicks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie Hicks</a>, an <a href="https://humansciences.iit.edu/faculty/marie-hicks">Assistant Professor of History at the Illinois Institute of Technology</a>, offers a detailed and comprehensive overview of this radical social change. Based on rich and detailed archival and interview sources, packed with illustrations and individual narratives of the 1940s to the 1970s, the book demonstrates how the rigid class and gender hierarchies of British society were recreated and reproduced in attempts to modernise the state through technology. As the book&#8217;s conclusion notes, &#8220;all history of computing is gendered history,&#8221; meaning the book is essential reading for anyone interested in how we have the computing and technology industries we have today. The first chapter of the book can be read <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Introduction%20Programmed%20Inequality.pdf">here</a>, and you can learn more about the book and Dr. Hick&#8217;s work <a href="https://twitter.com/histoftech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on her twitter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/proginequality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the book&#8217;s twitter feed.</a><br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the most interesting, but largely overlooked silent films, is Haxan, written and directed by Benjamin Christensen.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://cayleff.sdsu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Susan Cayleff&#8217;</a>s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421419033/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature&#8217;s Path: A History of Naturopathic Healing in America</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016) offers a fascinating alternative to the development of allopathic orthodoxy in the twentieth-century United States. By following Naturopathy from its nineteenth-century origins in the popular health movement through debates in the 1970s, Cayleff sheds light on an enduring critique of the vision of medicine institutionalized by Progressive public health reformers. The holistic medicine proffered by naturopaths drew from a variety of sources and lacked a common theoretical basis; it required closer collaboration between practitioner and patient for gradual cures in the face of medical complexity, a scenario reminiscent of an increasing portion of today&#8217;s medical practice, as <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/robert-aronowitz-risky-medicine-our-quest-to-cure-fear-and-uncertainty-u-chicago-press-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Aronowitz points out in Risky Medicine</a>.<br />
However, Cayleff shows not merely a transhistorical struggle of self-determination, but rather shifting cultural and political grounds on which such different ideological battles were waged and heterodox practices staged. Notably, she highlights how naturopathy empowered female practitioners to work in line with their politics, and gave them access to medical power precluded by the medical establishment. This book is a great read for historians of medicine, countercultural movements, and professionalization.<br />
This is the first of a pair of interviews on alternative medicine: for a rhetorical approach to how notions of evidence are invoked to demarcate between alternative and mainstream medical practice, look out for my forthcoming interview with Colleen Derkatch on her book, Bounding Biomedicine.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The wish to transcend one&#8217;s mortality, and the anxiety associated with being unable to do so, are universal human experiences. People deal with these in their idiosyncratic ways, often by transgressing rules and boundaries that serve as the parameters of civilized human coexistence. Technological advances expand our capacities for transcending our limitations, especially when they allow us to objectify other humans and humanize our objects. Such forms of perversion are the subject of Danielle Knafo and Rocco Lo Bosco&#8217;s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Perversion-Technology-Psychoanalysis-Culture/dp/1138849219/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490388318&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=age+of+perversion">The Age of Perversion: Desire and Technology in Psychoanalysis and Culture</a> (Routledge, 2016). In my interview with Knafo, we explore her redefinition of perversion and her view on its current and future manifestations and what it implies for the survival of humanity.<br />
<a href="http://danielleknafo.com">Danielle Knafo</a> is a professor in the clinical psychology doctoral program at Long Island University and faculty member and supervisor in New York University&#8217;s postdoctoral program in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. She has lectured internationally and published extensively, including her prior book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Unconscious-Art-Psychoanalysis-Book/dp/0415881013/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490388367&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dancing+with+the+unconscious">Dancing with the Unconscious</a>, published in 2012 also by Routledge.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.kmcauliffe.com/">Kathleen McAuliffe</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0544947258/?tag=newbooinhis-20">This is Your Brain on Parasites: How Tiny Creatures Manipulate Our Behavior and Shape Society</a> (Mariner Books, 2017) unveils the world of parasites. From the influence of parasites on the ability to transform rats brains to be easily susceptible to cat predation to altering web formation structures in spiders, parasites hold the power to control an animals behavior. McAuliffe illustrates the ways in which parasites have had influence in human cognition and behavior, as well, with examples of impulsivity and reckless driving. Parasites may have compounded influence in the greater dimensions of culture, where strong scientific research suggests the interplay between parasites and prejudice, political affiliation, sexual attraction, gender bias, and morality. The forgotten emotion of disgust and the avoidance of disease may be at the heart of this interplay as our innate mechanisms drive the impulse for survival. This book illuminates the role of parasites and challenges our behavioral responses to critically think and question social norms. Most importantly, McAuliffe offers the vantage point from a parasite-centric view, a voice that has been previously unheard-until now.<br />

The letters feature three major themes: Sarrocchi consulting Galileo for writerly advice as she revised her epic poem, Sarrocchi&#8217;s efforts to defend Galileo&#8217;s discoveries to the scientific community in Italy, and Sarrocchi and Galileo&#8217;s shared interest in judicial astrology and natal charts or nativities. The slim volume will be a resource not just for readers and researchers but also for classroom discussion, where the letters could serve as great primary sources to feature in a number of course contexts.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On the frontier of feminist technoscience research, <a href="https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-t/medarbetare/johnson-ericka?l=en" target="_blank">Ericka Johnson&#8217;s</a> collaborative project <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/3319514865/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Gendering Drugs: Feminist Studies of Pharmaceuticals </a>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2017) explores how the gendered body is produced in and by medical technologies. From an Alzheimers disease study that relied on the process of sexing flies, to the pharamceuticalized prostate, to the medical experiences of transgender children, Part 1 uses the body as subject to disrupt the binaries of male/female, human/non-human and healthy/unhealthy. In Part 2, titled Creating Subjectivities for Patients in Advertising, the book expands its analysis to the commercial images and discourses used in marketing and prescribing relational subjectivities. Observing the way pharmaceuticals insert themselves into familial and romantic relationships, the HPV vaccine is used as an example of drugs as non-human participants in the parent-child partnership. Through an international lens, Part 3 provides three comparative case studies of the way that knowledge about HPV is produced in Columbia, the U.K. and Austria.<br />
In perhaps the most poignant contribution to feminist research agendas, across disciplines, Johnson concludes our interview by explaining her unique metaphor of refraction. Noting the notorious difficulty of seeing and articulating discursive power structures, Johnson recognises that the ability to articulate what is being said to us or about us, and identifying who is doing that saying, is a cornerstone to feminist scholarship as it allows us to identify against whom can we protest, deny, and challenge. Her metaphor of refraction is thus a way of thinking about material objects, once they have become tropes, such as the HPV vaccine across national contexts, and being able to see it as a prism that refracts the discourses within which it was originally entangled. This image of refraction forces us to think of a material object like the HPV vaccine as creating a spectrum of visible actors, concerns and values. And it is these visible things that help us to articulate discourses &#8211; which then allow us to protest and possibly erase their problematic power structures.<br />

Taylor Fox-Smith is teaching gender studies at Macquarie University and researching the gender gap in political behaviour and psychology at the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, Australia. Having received a Bachelor of International and Global Studies with first class Honours in American Studies at the University of Sydney, Taylor was awarded the American Studies Best Thesis Award for her work titled The Lemonade Nexus. The thesis uses the theme of marital infidelity in Beyonce&#8217;s 2016 visual album Lemonade as a popular cultural narrative of institutional betrayal, and parallels it with police brutality in Baltimore city. It argues that the album provides an alternative model of political formation which can help to understand redemption in the wake of an urban uprising. Rewriting the traditional protest to politics narrative with an iterative nexus named after the album, Taylor&#8217;s research continues to straddle political science, gender studies and popular culture.<br />

Science and empire were deeply intertwined in the Spanish Atlantic, and Crawford offers a window into the epistemic culture produced by Spanish colonial governance and resulting encounters across and within the Andean and Atlantic contexts. Part One of the book looks carefully at what it meant to know nature in the early modern Atlantic World. It traces the transformations of quina from a local Andean remedy into a botanical commodity and an imperial natural resource from the mid-seventeenth to mid-eighteenth centuries, showing how these transformations resulted from the bark&#8217;s integration into Andean, Atlantic, and imperial networks of circulation of people, texts, objects, and images. Part Two of the book explores several key conflicts in the late eighteenth century that emerged as the Spanish Crown tried to assert greater control over the tree and its bark. It&#8217;s a story that will be of interest to the histories of science, medicine, natural history, and early modernity!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Stacy Alaimo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816628386/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Exposed: Environmental Politics and Pleasures in Posthuman Time</a>s (University of Minnesota Press, 2016) is a provocative reflection on environmental ethics, politics, and forms of knowledge. Through a range of examples as broad as the theoretical scope of the book, <a href="http://www.uta.edu/english/alaimo/" target="_blank">Alaimo</a> analyzes political responses to climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, and plastic pollution, as well as the epistemologies that have shaped our understanding of these crises. Simultaneously, this series of essays also explores the intimacies and entanglements of human and non-human subjectivities in the Anthropocene, arguing for a new materialist engagement with the world. Despite the gravity of her subject matter, Alaimo&#8217;s examples and writing are often playful. This not only echoes the complexity and occasional contradictions of environmental politics but also makes Exposed a very enjoyable read.<br />
Drawing on examples from film, fiction, poetry, scientific writing, art, and activism, Alaimo considers the role pleasure has played and could play in various environmentalisms and environmental engagements. Though it bridges and contributes to scholarly work in the fields of environmental studies, feminism, materialism, and posthumanism, this book is much more than a theoretical exploration; it calls on us to rethink what it means to be human and act accordingly. Alaimo demonstrates interconnections between queer animals, naked protesters, melting glaciers, and interested scholars while providing thoughtful guidance on how to understand and respond to the environmental predicaments to which we are all, to varying degrees, exposed.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1447329015/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Digital Sociologies</a> (Policy Press, 2016) <a href="https://twitter.com/JessieNYC">Jessie Daniels</a>, <a href="http://www.jessienyc.com">Professor of Sociology at Hunter College and The Graduate Center, CUNY</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/claudiakincaid">Karen Gregory</a> a <a href="http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/sociology/karen_gregory">Lecturer in Digital Sociology at the University of Edinburgh</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/tressiemcphd">Tressie McMillan Cottom</a>, <a href="https://tressiemc.com">assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University</a>, have brought together a wealth of scholarship to explore the challenge of digital. The book engages with a range of theoretical questions, including challenging the digital/traditional sociology binary, the role of institutions, digital&#8217;s impact on eduction, the racialized practices of Twitch, the meaning of motherhood, the quantified self, the question of the body, and the digital sociological imagination. The eclectic range of scholars, offering perspectives from across the academic life course and deploying examples from across the world, create an important intervention into our understanding of this emerging, and perhaps as a result of this book, established, field of study. Ultimately the book is a call for a new community of scholars to engage with this most important element of contemporary life. <br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_john_hadley" target="_blank">John Hadley&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0739189255/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Animal Property Rights: A Theory of Habitat Rights for Wild Animals</a> (Lexington Books, 2015) presents a novel approach to addressing habitat and biodiversity loss: extending liberal property rights to wildlife. Hadley argues that a guardianship system could effectively protect the rights of wild animals to resources in the territories they inhabit. In turn, the guardians of particular animals or a particular species could challenge land use plans that might threaten the ability of these animals to meet their basic needs.<br />
Though grounded in philosophical theory, Hadley&#8217;s focus is pragmatic. He is interested in producing an institutional design that could be effectively incorporated into policy and practice. His proposal also aims to solve some key problems in wildlife conservation. It bridges the seemingly divergent interests of environmentalists focused on the protection of the collective (e.g., ecosystems) and those of animal rights proponents focused on the survival of individuals. Here, common ground is found in habitat protection, a shared value that reconciles the differences between these groups. Hadley&#8217;s proposal also ensures animals become vocal stakeholders in land use and conservation initiatives, able to compete with agendas that might be incompatible with animal or habitat protection. It also begins to overcome the anthropocentrism that (perhaps inevitably) pervades conservation practice. By determining animal property rights boundaries on the basis of territorial behavior, Hadley&#8217;s proposal privileges animal actions and interactions over human-centric interests. Although their rights would be advocated by a human guardian in a person-centered legal system, if implemented, this theory would ensure the interests of wild animals are taken seriously. This is a book of critical relevance to those interested in issues of human-wildlife conflict, biodiversity protection, and human/nonhuman relationships.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

He is a Harvard-trained biologist and former tenured professor who resigned from his academic post to earn a degree from the world-renowned University of Southern California film school. As a documentary filmmaker, Olson has sought to fuse critical thinking and Hollywood storytelling. And as the author or co-author of three books, Olson has shown how scientists and academics in general can improve their communication skills and harness the power of narrative to improve their writing and presentations. Narrative is an indispensable tool that geographers and others can use to communicate with our students and the general public. Yet Olson also shows how we can hone our narrative intuition and use our story sense to write better abstracts, articles, and grant applications. <a href="http://www.scienceneedsstory.com/" target="_blank">Houston, We Have a Narrative</a> has gems of wisdom for physical geographers, human geographers, and academics of all stripes.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/Jones.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew L. Jones&#8217;s</a> wonderful new book traces a history of failed efforts to make calculating machines, from Blaise Pascal&#8217;s work in the 1640s through the efforts of Charles Babbage in the nineteenth century, incorporating an account of both the work and relationships of scholars and artisans, and their reflections on the nature of invention. Innovative in its approach and its form, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022641146X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reckoning with Matter: Calculating Machines, Innovation, and Thinking about Thinking from Pascal to Babbage </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2016) offers a thoughtful and beautifully-written history of technology that offers an important perspective on a division between two poles of writing the history of technology: &#8220;the collective, deterministic account of inventive activity and the individualistic, heroic, creative account (7).&#8221; In Jones&#8217;s hands, we are offered a third way of understanding cultural production in early modernity, one that did not bifurcate between imitation and originality, social and individual making, or design and production. Central to the story is the history of efforts to mechanize the process of carrying ones in addition, and this fascinating problem persists as a thread through many of the projects discussed in the book. On the pages of Reckoning with Matter, readers will not only enjoy a compelling account of machine calculation through the nineteenth century, but will also find the story of a frog that tears out the eyes of a fish, a man who designed machines for making breakfast, and discussions of the significance of credit and intellectual property, modern programming, sketching, imitation, and debates over the nature of thinking. Highly recommended!<br />

Mukharji develops and engages a number of key concepts in the work, significantly introducing a notion of physiograms (materialized physiologies or materialized body metaphors, a development of John Tresch&#8217;s notion of cosmograms) and a way of thinking about the braiding of strands of science and medicine. It&#8217;s a beautifully written and compellingly argued work that will be of interest to a wide range of readers of the history of science and medicine!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The year 2016 was the hottest year on record, and in recent months, drought and searing heat have fanned wildfires in Fort McMurray Alberta and in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Meanwhile, the Arctic has had record high temperatures, leading one climate researcher to warn the region is unraveling. Yet for the most part, these climate-related events and dire warnings from climatologists have fallen on deaf ears, especially in the United States, where climate-change denial is firmly entrenched, especially among Republican lawmakers. But why?<br />
In his recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0295995602/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Behind the Curve: Science and the Politics of Global Warming</a> (University of Washington Press, 2016), historian <a href="https://www.reed.edu/dean_of_faculty/faculty_profiles/profiles/howe-joshua.html" target="_blank">Joshua Howe</a> seeks to answer this question. Howe traces the history of climate change from a scientific oddity in the late 1950s to a topic of fierce debate among politicians and environmental activists who fear that failure to tackle global warming will lead to stronger storms, fiercer wildfires, and rising seas. Scientists knew the most about the nuances of climate change, yet seemed unable to convince policy makers or the public to tackle the problem. Howe sees the climatologists narrow focus on the science of global warming as a partial reason for the inaction. Part history of science, part history of environmentalism, Behind the Curve is a provocative book exploring one of the most vexing issues of our time.<br />

Much of the attention paid to digital politics is about speech. What did Donald Trump say on Twitter today? And who responded? Karpf&#8217;s book suggest that that attention has overlooked the other side of digital politics: listening. In Analytic Activism, Karpf focuses on how organizations use the digital footprints we all leave online to inform strategy. A/B testing and digital petitions allow political groups to hear what constituents care about and then later to use that information to mobilize and drive action.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/074566251X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Age of Sharing</a> (Polity Press, 2016), the sociologist and media scholar <a href="http://nicholasjohn.huji.ac.il" target="_blank">Nicholas A. John</a> documents the history and current meanings of the word sharing, which he argues, is a central keyword of contemporary media discourse. John interrogates the rhetorical work that sharing does as a practice, a form of communication and a business model. He argues that in the last decade, sharing has come to dominate the way we think about our online activities, and indeed, the way we live. He demonstrates, how the therapeutic culture that defined the twentieth century, now shapes how we perceive and discuss our personal and economic interactions both online and offline. Moreover, it was the therapeutic discourse that informed and energized the shift from sharing as a distributive practice of material objects to the ethos of sharing as caring. John combines a close analysis of social media sites such as Facebook and businesses such Airbnb with a linguistic analysis of the genealogy of the concept of sharing, the unknown history of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the subculture of hackers to explain the ascent of sharing as a daily practice and coveted social currency. Nicholas A. John is Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816699887/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Programming: Brainwashing, Automatons, and American Unfreedom</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2016), <a href="https://english.arizona.edu/users/scott-selisker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Selisker</a> offers readers a fascinating new history of American anxieties along the borderland between the machine and the human mind. Demonstrating the way that a variety of fields influence and coproduce one another, Human Programming follows the metaphor of the automaton through news media, fiction, psychology, cybernetics, film, law and back again. Along the way, Selisker engages academic work on labor automation, posthumanism, affect and emotion, and techno-Orientalism.<br />
Through careful interpretation of books on American soldiers returning from the Korean War, the trial of Patty Hearst, the narrative logic of Snow Crash and Blade Runner, the central conflicts of Homeland and the Manchurian Candidate, and the baffled news reports on John Walker Lindh, Human Programming &#8220;offers a new literary and cultural context for understanding the human automaton figure&#8221; as it has appeared and reappeared over the half century, and explores how the metaphor of the automaton has &#8220;shaped American conversations about the self and other, the free and unfree, and democracy and its enemies, since World War II&#8221; (7, 8). Beginning with a prehistory in WWII propaganda, this timely study comes up to a present in which we replace our employees with touchscreens, rely on machine learning to translate our conversations, use proprietary software to plot our routes, and deny the human freedom of our fellow citizens.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Statistics have been on the minds of more people than usual in the run-up and post-mortem of this past U.S. presidential election; some feel as though they were misled by numbers intended to lend a modicum of certainty to the complex calculus of modern life. But while election predictions come and go, the &#8220;empire of chance&#8221; lays siege to more and more aspects of daily life, alongside increasing possibilities for technological intervention&#8211;nowhere, perhaps, is this more clear than in medicine. <a href="http://ldi.upenn.edu/expert/robert-aronowitz-md" target="_blank">Robert Aronowitz&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022604971X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Risky Medicine: Our Quest to Cure Fear and Uncertainty</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) is both a nuanced and accessible exploration of the historical transformation of risk in modern biomedicine. Through a series of case studies and broader reflections on the ways in which modern medicine has become &#8220;risky,&#8221; Aronowitz teases out salient features of an increasingly complex system of interventions and indicators.<br />
In the book, Aronowitz defines three key aspects of our modern &#8220;risky medicine.&#8221; The first one discussed is a converged experience of risk and disease, exemplified in cancer screening in which bodies-at-risk can be subject to similar treatment and prevention regimes as those marked by a chronic condition or trying to prevent remission. Another aspect is the notion of risk reduction standing in place of efficacy for the psychological and social work it performs, which provides some explanation for the costliness of American medicine relative to the outcomes it achieves. Finally, Aronowitz argues that risk interventions have been driven by expansion of the medical market, and calls upon policymakers to become aware of the control pharmaceutical companies have in the generation of new health risks and the data to support them.<br />
One way of understanding Aronowitz&#8217;s contribution is to contextualize it within the trajectory of sociological work on risk in modern society. Originally published in 1986 (in German), Ulrich Beck&#8217;s Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity was a watershed book for the understanding of modernity and technological change. Much of Beck&#8217;s account is concerned with environmental risks; the book came out on the heels of the Three Mile Island and Bhopal disasters. However, Beck&#8217;s take on medicine is somewhat lacking. Beck presciently calls attention to the &#8220;reflexive market strategy&#8221; of pharmaceutical companies, in which they profit from self-produced risks&#8211;echoing the third aspect of &#8220;risky medicine&#8217;&#8211;but misses its more immediate social and psychological dimensions, stating merely that the rise of chronic disease is evidence of a divergence of diagnosis and therapy. Aronowitz&#8217;s case studies suggest even more immediate consequences at hand. The importance of Risky Medicine is evident in how it disaggregates the changing landscape of health and medicine from an inexorable creep of modernity, spelling out the logic subjecting more bodies to greater interventions and recovering the relationship between experience and an ambivalent, anticipatory social order.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since it was published in 2004, Ruth Rogaski&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520283821/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hygienic Modernity: Meanings of Health and Disease in Treaty-Port China</a> (University of California Press, 2014 reprint) has won four major prizes in fields ranging from history of medicine to East Asian history. It is easy to see why. Set in the Chinese treaty port of Tianjin, the book follows Chinese elites over the tumultuous decades that spanned the middle of the nineteenth century to World War Two. Chinese elites in Tianjin engaged British, French, and, importantly, Japanese imperialists and traders in their midst, creating what Rogaski thinks is best called a &#8220;hypercolony.&#8221; Simultaneously, Chinese elites pressed their own nation-building projects, working to distinguish themselves both from the foreigners and also from the masses they ruled. To do so, they adopted, adapted, and cultivated particular ways of building a modern nation in the final years of the Qing dynasty, which hung, importantly, on practices of hygiene. These ideal ways of being hygienic, thus modern, fundamentally rearranged the urban landscape of Tianjin and the practice of everyday life.<br />
Rogaski writes wonderfully and leads the way through tricky historical evidence, pointing out how Chinese elites modernizing projects were apparent in the changed meaning of weisheng. In the early nineteenth century, the term referred to individual ways of guarding health and a century later had come explicitly to refer to government-directed public hygiene measures&#8211;&#8220;hygienic modernity&#8221;&#8211;without ever shedding its earlier inflections. The book shows that modernity is not so much a time period, but an aspiration and a process&#8211;always incomplete, seemingly right around the washroom corner. Creatively designed and insightfully analyzed, this study defies any simple binaries of colonizer and colonized, or of indigenous and scientific medicine. Rogaski wears her theory lightly and has plenty new to show&#8211;not least to historians of medicine who may be most familiar with the stories of colonial medicine from Africa and India.<br />

How are software engineers managed? What are their goals and aspirations? How are they perceived by their foreign clients? In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199461481/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Reengineering India: Work, Capital, and Class in an Offshore Economy</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.nias.res.in/professor/carol-upadhya" target="_blank">Carol Upadhya</a> tackles these questions and many more. Based on extensive research in Bangalore &#8211; the large southern Indian metropolis that has led the IT buzz &#8211; the book explores the way capital, work and class are remade within the &#8220;new India.&#8221; Combining deep, rich and detailed accounts of life within &#8220;software factories&#8221; with a theoretical eclecticism and clear writing style, the book is a truly wonderful anthropological account of an offshore economy.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life,&#8221; Oscar Wilde famously observed. Wilde&#8217;s waning romanticism can be read in stark contrast with Nietzsche, who argued around the same time, &#8220;art is nothing but a kind of applied physiology.&#8221; <a href="http://www.history.ubc.ca/people/robert-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Brain&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0295993200/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pulse of Modernism: Physiological Aesthetics in Fin-de-Siecle Europe</a> (University of Washington Press, 2015) unveils a fascinating world of exchange between artistic studios and physiology laboratories concealed by such pithy aphorisms. Brain argues that the influence and stature of physiological aesthetics have been overlooked in accounts of modernism in science and art, and seeks to recover experimental systems that were incredibly influential and fertile in their cultural situation.<br />
Brain first sets himself to chart the development of physiological recording in the sciences, first as experimental technique, then as ontology, in a fascinating chapter on the protoplasm theory of life and on to its application to the human qua human problems of linguistic analysis. He then describes the experimentalization of visual art (Georges Seurat, Edvard Munch) and poetry (Gustave Kahn, F. T. Marinetti). The influence of Charles Henry, who inhabited both artists&#8217; circles and physiology laboratories in his work as a preparateur, becomes a key pivot in Brain&#8217;s narrative through his creation a scientific aesthetic that could be deployed as a kind of productive black-box. The Pulse of Modernism is a rich portrait of fin-de-siecle material and intellectual culture, and challenges the pride of place given to Victorian sensibilities in the fashioning of the late modern (early modernist) scientific subject.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Quantification is not usually the first thing that comes to mind when hearing or reading about the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights (OHCHR). Yet in the 21st century, a wide range of policy and advocacy agendas begin with numbers. Those numbers become indicators, composites, standards, and measurement tools, which then get adopted in advocacy rhetoric or policy practice.<br />
In T<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022626128X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">he Seduction of Quantification: Measuring Human Rights, Gender Violence, and Sex Trafficking</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016), <a href="http://anthropology.as.nyu.edu/object/sally.merry" target="_blank">Sally Engle Merry</a> combines ethnography, human rights, and science and technology studies to explore how people living in vulnerable situations across the globe are represented by the numbers designed to both name and support them. While numbers do not have agency, and cannot help or hurt on their own, Merry dedicates most of the book to untangling the politics and practice of developing standards and indicators, and interpreting the realities that come with &#8220;governance by numbers.&#8221; The genealogy of these indicators and standards are given as much space as their application, as Merry describes their highly political origins and a process of their subtle acceptance as normalover time.<br />
With roots in colonial authority and population management, indicators have been developed and used for a range of purposes in governance: to manage people, resources, planning, dissent, and reputations among others. Merry explores indicators and indices from legal, anthropological, historical, and genealogical perspectives, describing a range of unexpected stewards from short-term United Nations consultants to U.S. State Department officials to computer algorithms. While the book focuses on the globalization of definitions, measurements, and management techniques, it simultaneously explores the widely varied phenomena of gender violence, human rights, and human trafficking. On a set of topics that have been broadly fetishized, the overlay of quantified assessments and accompanying responses to them raises many questions about voice, politics, and international policy-making among many other topics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Robert Peckham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107446767/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epidemics in Modern Asia</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2016) explores the crucial yet under-explored role that epidemics have played in both colonial and postcolonial Asia. At once broad in sweep and nuanced in analysis, Peckham&#8217;s work explores a series of world-changing disease outbreaks across from the eighteenth century through the present.<br />
Organized around five themes (Mobility, Cities, Environment, War, and Globalization), the book looks at the interrelationship between disease and human society at both the particular and hemispheric level. In doing so, the book challenges old assumptions about Asia as a pre-modern hotspot and site of contamination, as well as the narrative of triumphant progress of western medicine east. Instead, Peckham examines how disease, infection, and epidemic are translated across divides of culture and power in both the colonial and postcolonial periods. This innovative study is an essential read for a number of audiences. Whether readers are interested in the lasting impacts of intersections between colonial and indigenous peoples, the history of world capitalism and trade, the development of bureaucratic structures and government power, and/or the demographic and environmental impacts of the rise of the modern world, Epidemics in Modern Asia presents a powerful revisionist interpretation, bringing the history of epidemics to the center of the frame.<br />
<a href="http://www.history.hku.hk/people/staff-robert-peckham.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Robert Peckham</a> is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Hong Kong, where he also serves as Director of the Centre for the Humanities and Medicine. He had edited two previous volumes, Empires of Panic: Epidemics and Colonial Anxieties (Hong Kong: University Press, 2014) and Disease and Crime: A History of Social Pathologies and the New Politics of Health (New York: Routledge: 2014). He also is co-editer, with David M. Pomfret, of Imperial Contagions: Medicine, Hygiene, and Cultures of Planning in Asia (Hong Kong: University of Hong Kong Press, 2014), as well as the author of a rich body of articles on Asian history and the history of medicine.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The social practice we call science has had spectacular success in explaining the natural world since the 17th century. While advanced mathematics and other precursors of modern science were not unique to Europe, it was there that Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, and others came up with theories that got modern physics and chemistry off the ground. In his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199385076/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wondrous Truths: The Improbable Triumph of Modern Science</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jdtrout1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">J.D. Trout</a> mounts a spirited defense of the claim that the best explanation of the rise of science in 17th Century Europe is that Newton and others got lucky; among other serendipitous factors, they happened to come up with versions of preexisting ideas that were just right enough to explain just enough of the world, and that was enough to get the ball rolling.<br />
Trout, who is Professor of Philosophy and Psychology at Loyola University in Chicago, defends the scientific realist view that scientific theories are successful because they are by and large true, not just predictively accurate. He also sharply distinguishes the psychology of explanation&#8211;the Aha! feeling of understanding&#8211;from the truth of an explanation. On his ontic view of explanation, we can experience being satisfied with bad (false) explanations, and there are true theories we may never understand.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://twitter.com/mckenziewark?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKenzie Wark&#8217;</a>s new book begins and ends with a playful call: &#8220;Workings of the world untie! You have a win to world!&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1784784087/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Molecular Red: Theory for the Anthropocene </a>(Verso, 2015) creates a conversation between work from two very different Soviet and American contexts. After guiding readers through the work and theories of Alexander Bogdanov, whose focus on the importance of labor in organizing knowledge forms a central thread through the book as a whole, Wark traces some of those notions in the writing of novelist and utopian Andrey Platonov. The second half of the book extends the conversation into science studies, beginning in a chapter that considers the work of Feyerabend, Haraway, Barad, and Edwards in light of Bogdanov and Platonov&#8217;s approaches to labor and knowledge, and continuing into a chapter devoted to Kim Stanley Robinson&#8217;s Mars Trilogy. The result is a fascinating treatment of the centrality of labor and the importance of the not-necessarily-human to understanding and theorizing the Anthropocene. (As Wark reminds us, Labor is the mingling of many things, most of them not human.) The entire book is highly recommended, and for the STS-minded among us the third chapter of the book would make an especially useful assignment in a discussion group or seminar devoted to contemporary theory and/in STS.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Beginning in the late 19th century, Siddiqi demonstrates that a popular fascination with space travel and amateurs engaged popular science were the driving forces behind the development of technologies that led to the Soviet space program. From the writings of Konstatin Tsiolkovsky to space exhibitions in the 1920s to Sergei Korolev&#8217;s pioneering work, Siddiqi challenges established Soviet narratives of the space program&#8217;s history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Our modern networked world owes an oftentimes unacknowledged debt to Guglielmo Marconi. As <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/keyword/Marc%20Raboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Raboy</a> demonstrates in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019931358X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marconi: The Man Who Networked the World</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), it was he who pioneered the concept of wireless global communications. As a teenager he was fascinated by the recent discovery of radio waves, and by the time he was in his early twenties he had developed an apparatus that used these waves to transmit and receive messages. Traveling to London, he demonstrated a gift for publicity as he established himself as a technological pioneer in an age of rapidly emerging wonders. Thanks to his unassailable patents, Marconi soon created a global communications empire, one that made his name synonymous with radio and was so dominant that it brought the nations of the world together in an unprecedented international agreement to regulate the field of wireless telegraphy. Raboy recounts Marconi&#8217;s roving life as a celebrated figure, the development of his multinational business concerns, and his later relationship with the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and the shadow it cast over his posthumous reputation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&#8221;<br />
Clarke&#8217;s third law, coined in 1973, expresses the difficulty that people of any era have in reconciling the bounds of current knowledge with our experiences in a world full of marvels. In a fascinating investigation of role of automata in the culture of the medieval Latin west, <a href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/people/elly-truitt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E.R. Truitt&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812223578/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medieval Robots: Mechanism, Magic, Nature, and Art </a>(University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015) traces the story of automata from their early appearance in the Latin west as gifts of foreign courts, to the literary manifestations of these objects, to the eventual creation of elaborate mechanical automata in the middle of the thirteenth century. Along the way, this history examines the nature of marvels, the constitution of natural knowledge, the text-based transformation of Latin intellectual culture, definitions of life and death, the spectacle of court, and the mechanics of the universe (8, 9). The cast of characters, both fictional and factual, embraces writers, travelers, and natural philosophers ranging from Liudprand of Cremona (c. 920 972), Pope Sylvester II (c. 946 1003) and Fr. William of Rubruck (c. 1220 1293), to Sir John Mandeville, witness of marvels mechanical and divine, and a Charlemagne whose stay in Constantinople brings him face to face with a pagan rulers powers of astral science that test the potentials of Charlemagne&#8217;s piety.<br />
Our conversation about Truitt&#8217;s comprehensively researched and highly readable book ranges over C-3PO&#8217;s medieval forebears in the alabaster chamber, the religious rehabilitation of disembodied talking heads, the role of clocks and clockwork in the discourse shift from natural philosophy to mechanical engineering, and the political significance of lewd mechanical monkeys covered in rotting badger pelts.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the most commonly used words right now in education is &#8220;innovation.&#8221; It seems to be part of any response to our collective anxiety over the fact that the way we educate children does not seem to have changed as quickly as the ways we access information, communicate with each other, or travel from place to place. Of course, before innovation was an education buzzword, it was a buzzword in Silicon Valley. It is easy to list examples of companies that are innovative &#8212; Google, Apple, Uber, etc. &#8212; but it is much harder to define. This leaves us to wonder, is innovation in schools just integrating more apps and touchscreens? If not, what is it? And if we want innovation in schools, how do we get there? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0986155497/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Innovator&#8217;s Mindset: Empower Learning, Unleash Talent, and Lead a Culture of Creativity</a> (Dave Burgess Consulting, 2015), <a href="http://georgecouros.ca/blog/about-me" target="_blank">George Couros</a>, provides a framework evaluating whether school practices are truly innovative as well as a guide for leaders interested in fostering changes in their schools that are both original and positive.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.history.ucla.edu/faculty/caroline-ford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caroline Ford&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674045904/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natural Interests: The Contest over Environment in Modern France </a>(Harvard University Press, 2016) explores the roots of French environmental consciousness in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Far from being a product of the postwar environmental movement, Ford shows how French society began to understand how humans adversely affected their surroundings during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Popular writers like Francois-Antoine Rauch demonstrated how deforestation altered the climate and damaged the habitability of the nation. War, revolution, and a series of devastating floods brought the questions of deforestation, urbanization, and industrial capitalism into conflict with the finite resources of nature. Public worries over resource depletion and climate change mingled with a new bourgeois consciousness developing in the nineteenth century. France&#8217;s countryside became a place of romantic longing for families, a source of inspiration for artists, and an important symbol of national pride. Historical landmarks became sites of a unique French heritage to be preserved and protected for future generations. Empire also became a site of environmental sensitivity, where the conflicting interests of Europeans and colonized peoples played out through discourses of conservation and ecological change in French Algeria.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Is the scientific value of objectivity in conflict with the social justice commitment to diversity? In her latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022624136X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Objectivity and Diversity: A New Logic of Scientific Inquiry</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015), <a href="https://gseis.ucla.edu/directory/sandra-harding/" target="_blank">Sandra Harding</a> (Education and Gender Studies, UCLA) argues not only that objectivity and diversity need not be in conflict, but that good research ought to be committed to both values at the same time. The book draws on a rich array of scholarship, spanning from 20th century philosophy of science to contemporary studies in indigenous and postcolonial philosophy and activism. It is an intricate study of the ways in which objectivity, positivism, and secularism are all deeply intertwined with their social contexts and historical moments. The book ultimately advocates a science that is both responsive to a methodological requirement for strong objectivity, and originates in local communities.<br />

In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107073006/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Smoke of London: Energy and Environment in the Early Modern City </a>(Cambridge University Press, 2016), <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/history/facultyandstaff/faculty/cavert-will.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Cavert</a> examines how Londoners first grappled with the problem of air pollution created by the burning of coal. With concerns expressed for the dwindling supply of wood in England, Londoners in the 16th and 17th centuries increasingly turned to coal to heat their homes and power their businesses. As the amount of smoke produced by burning coal grew it prompted a variety of responses, from crown-directed efforts to prevent it from contaminating the royal space to its adoption in poems and plays as a symbol of modern urban life. As Cavert reveals, these efforts to grapple with the problem of coal smoke presaged the reaction to the much larger issue of industrial pollution throughout England during the Industrial Revolution and, in the process, framed many of these issues in ways with which people are familiar today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This is a book about the future &#8211; the historical future as three interconnected generations of atmospheric researchers experienced it and envisioned it in the first part of the twentieth century.<br />
<a href="http://www.colby.edu/sts/JimFleming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Rodger Fleming&#8217;s</a> new book is a big picture history of atmospheric science that follows the lives and careers of three men who worked at the center of meteorological research in roughly the first half of the 20thcentury: Vilhelm Bjerknes, Carl-Gustav Rossby, and Harry Wexler. Though it takes these three figures as orienting tools, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262033941/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inventing Atmospheric Science: Bjerknes, Rossby, Wexler, and the Foundations of Modern Meteorology </a>(MIT Press, 2016) this is not a biography of three lone geniuses: Fleming is careful to show that the emergence of atmospheric science was a team effort and the result of work by many people in different disciplines and areas. Fleming&#8217;s use of archival materials allows readers to appreciate the significance and roles of otherwise-overlooked or ignored historical figures, including Anne Louise Beck (who we discuss in the course of the podcast). Inventing Atmospheric Science weaves together the histories of technology, mathematics, hydrodynamics, the aerospace industry, global pollution, climatology, chaos theory, the US Weather Bureau, and much more into a clear and engaging story thats also a pleasure to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Through ethnographic research into both a water privatization scheme and the practices of an IT company, Dasgupta reveals the similarities that cross-cut both domains as new and old inequalities are produced. Rich in detail and fascinating in its analytical drive the book opens up new avenues for thinking about citizenship and belonging.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Winner of the 2014 Joseph W. Elder Prize in the Indian Social Sciences the book is both profoundly intimate in its ethnographic depth and wonderfully ambitious with its theoretical reach.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Over the past quarter-century, scientists have been mapping and exploring the human genome to locate the genetic basis of disease and track the histories of populations across time and space. As part of this work, geneticists have formulated markers to calculate percentages of European, African, and Amerindian genetic ancestry in populations presumed to originate or inhabit particular geographic regions. The work done by geneticists in recent years has been received with a mixture of excitement and concern. Genomics is simultaneously viewed as the key to diagnosing and curing inherited disease, while also posing a threat to individual privacy and raising concerns over the reappearance of racialized thinking in scientific research.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822356597/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Mestizo Genomics: Race Mixture, Nation, and Science in Latin America</a> (Duke University Press, 2014), editors <a href="http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/peter.wade/default.htm">Peter Wade</a>, <a href="http://www.filosoficas.unam.mx/~lbeltran/">Carlos Lopez Beltran</a>, <a href="http://cienciassociales.javeriana.edu.co/estudiantes/maestrias/estudios-culturales">Eduardo Restrepo</a>, and <a href="https://fiocruz.academia.edu/RicardoVenturaSantos">Ricardo Ventura Santos</a> ask how ideas of race, ethnicity, nation, and gender enter into the work of genetic scientists? Conducting ethnographic research in genetics laboratories located in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico, the authors question the perceived divide between the scientific community and society at large in the production of knowledge. This important work illuminates how the concepts of race, nation, and gender are continually reproduced, challenged, and reformulated in both scientific and public discourse.<br />

The book argues that the primary reason that the Soviets struggled to network their nation rests on the institutional conditions supporting the scientific knowledge base and the command economy. In developing this argument, Peters guides readers through a story about economic cybernetics, the relationships between military and civilian sectors of Soviet society, computer networks as metaphors for brains or bodies, saxophone-playing robots, fake passports to fake countries, computer chess, and much more. The conclusion of the book also considers some of the implications of the Soviet experience for rethinking our current networked world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[From the 1880s onward, Beirut-based calendars and almanacs were in high demand as they packaged at least four different calendars into one, including: &#8220;the reformed Gregorian calendar; the unreformed, Julian calendar used by various churches of the East; the Islamic lunar Hijri calendar; and the Ottoman &#8216;Rumi&#8217; or sometimes financial/&#8217;Maliyye&#8217; calendar.&#8221; Described as a center of calendar pluralism, Beirut&#8217;s plurality of time was less an exception than it was a quandary to later advocates who aimed to organize time along geographical lines.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674286146/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Global Transformation of Time: 1870-1950</a> (Harvard University Press, 2015), <a href="http://www.history.upenn.edu/people/faculty/vanessa-ogle" target="_blank">Vanessa Ogle</a> excavates 19th century movements to reform and standardize time: summer time, calendar time, time zones, religious time, and national time among others. Ogle questions the inevitability of 21st century time, demonstrating that it was the object of active creation for nearly two centuries prior. The rise of nationalism, the consolidation of colonial practice, along with autonomous religious reform movements simultaneously gave rise to, and were in turn, molded by advocacy focused on time. New communications technologies, such as the telegraph, and time-keeping devices, such as city clock towers, similarly served as the infrastructure around which time-keeping debates became organized.<br />
Written as a historical account, time becomes a central character in this book: casting a common lens over otherwise disconnected places and people, raising controversy, and shifting between the center and the periphery of a broader story of 19th century transformation.<br />

Based on fieldwork conducted over five years at a local office of the National Weather Service, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022629868X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Masters of Uncertainty: Weather Forecasters and the Quest for Ground Truth </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2015) develops a theory of decision making as a habitual, practical, social activity shaped by particular contexts of action. In addition to working closely with (and contributing substantively to) pragmatist philosophy and theoretical STS, Masters of Uncertainty also offers a thick and fascinating description of the practices and local environments of a community of artisan-practitioners charged with creating a kind of object&#8211;a weather forecast&#8211;that many of us consume regularly. After developing a sociological theory of decision making within the context of this case study, Daipha concludes the book by testing the theory in two other fields: finance and medicine. This is a compelling and clearly-written account that will be of interest to sociologists, STS scholars, and general readers alike!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Paying special attention to the constraints that limit and censor people&#8211;both ordinary citizens and musicians&#8211;from speaking out on sensitive political issues, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199334692/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima </a>(Oxford University Press, 2015) focuses on the music of post-Fukushima antinuclear protests. Manabe looks carefully at the roles and motivations of musicians in Japan who have become involved in protest movements and demonstrations that reach across a range of physical and virtual spaces. This book will be of interest to any readers eager to learn more about modern Japan, protest movements, music, and the histories of nuclear power and its discontents.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I like to think<br /><br />
(it has to be!)<br /><br />
of a cybernetic ecology<br /><br />
where we are free of our labors<br /><br />
and joined back to nature,<br /><br />
returned to our mammal<br /><br />
brothers and sisters,<br /><br />
and all watched over<br /><br />
by machines of loving grace.<br />
&#8211; Richard Brautigan, 1967<br />
By the time Richard Brautigan distributed his fifth collection of poetry, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, on the streets of San Francisco, his reference to &#8220;a cybernetic ecology&#8221; was not an obscurantist metaphor so much as a direct nod to a pervasive and generative intellectual discourse. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421416719/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Cybernetics Moment, Or Why We Call Our Age the Information Age </a>(Johns Hopkins UP, 2015), historian of technology <a href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/people/profile.cfm?netid=rrk1" target="_blank">Ron Kline</a> traces the emergence of this protean discourse, along with the shifting demarcations occurring within and around it as cybernetics worked its way between technology and theorization of the social world. In doing so, he provides perhaps the most comprehensive and incisive history to date of American cybernetics and information theory.<br />
While cybernetics began as a distinctly postwar science of communication and control, Kline shows how it was linked to but split off from discussions of the physical definition of information. Cyberneticians&#8217; emphasis on circular causality was a major influence on mid-century social science, and cybernetic theory was a common frame through which electronic computers were discussed in the media. As the subtitle suggests, Kline also grapples with the coherence of the term &#8216;information age,&#8217; whose advocates departed from cybernetics yet, as he argues, remained under its shadow. Through historicizing cybernetics as a &#8216;moment,&#8217; Kline characterizes the activities of its larger-than-life adherents with a sociologist&#8217;s eye, while unearthing both the material and conceptual artifacts left in its wake.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sabine_Arnaud" target="_blank">Sabine Arnaud</a>&#8216;s new book explores a history of discursive practices that played a role in the construction of hysteria as pathology. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022627554X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">On Hysteria: The Invention of a Medical Category between 1670 and 1820 </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2015) considers a wide range of issues that are both specific to the particular history of hysteria, and more broadly applicable to the history medicine. Arnaud pays special attention to the role played by language in the definition of any medical category, basing her analysis on a masterful analysis of a spectrum of written medical genres (including dialogue, autobiography, correspondence, narrative, and polemic) that have largely been forgotten by the history of medicine. Arnaud asks, &#8220;What made it possible to view dozens of different diagnoses as variants of a single pathology, hysteria?&#8221; The answer can be found in a long process of rewriting and negotiation over the definition of these diagnoses enabled this retrospective assimilation, which was driven by enormously diverse political and epistemological stakes. In a series of fascinating chapters, the book interweaves the history of hysteria with studies of gender, class, literature, metaphor, narrative, and and religion. It&#8217;s an expertly-researched and compellingly-written account that will amply reward readers interested in the histories of medicine and gender.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Communities of parents who refuse, delay, or selectively decline to vaccinate their children pose familiar moral and political questions concerning public health, safety, risk, and immunity. But additionally there are epistemological questions about these communities. Though frequently dismissed as simply ignorant, misinformed, or superstitious, it turns out that vaccine suspicion, denial, and refusal are positively correlated with higher levels of education, and greater depth of knowledge about vaccine science. Accordingly, the common view that vaccine refusal is the product of ignorance seems simplistic. Yet the more strident forms of vaccine refusal are based in demonstrably false beliefs. How is this best explained? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138790656/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Values and Vaccine Refusal: Hard Questions in Epistemology, Ethics, and Health Care</a> (Routledge 2016) <a href="https://wwwp.oakland.edu/cas/archive-temp/featured-faculty-profile/mark-navin" target="_blank">Mark Navin</a> offers a balanced examination of the epistemology and value commitments of various stripes of vaccine refusal. After arguing that vaccine refusers may be reasonable, he defends a novel version of the view that there is a moral requirement to vaccinate one&#8217;s children. He then defends the claim that the State may use coercive means to enhance vaccination, but Navin makes room for exemptions for non-medical reasons. Navin&#8217;s book is a fascinating philosophical exploration of some very deep questions at the intersection of social epistemology and social ethics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Conversations about death during hospitalization are among the most difficult imaginable: the moral weight of a human life is suspended by stressful conversations in which medical knowledge and personal context must be negotiated. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199392951/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Through the Valley of Shadows: Living Wills, Intensive Care, and Making Medicine Human</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.samuelbrown.net/" target="_blank">Samuel Morris Brown</a> approaches the problem of end-of-life care with a clinician&#8217;s eye and a scholar of religion&#8217;s touch.<br />
The book places advance directives in the clinic in their historical context while unpacking their ethical and legal nature, describes the psychological aspects of medical decision-making and how moral distress clouds judgment, and provides recommendations on how to heal the process of healing in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). An ICU physician himself, Brown&#8217;s account is interwoven with powerful stories that render his argument for humanistic care particularly salient. As such, Through the Valley of Shadows offers as much to dyed-in-the-wool humanists as it does to those focused on measuring and improving outcomes.<br />
This is the second of a pair of interviews on communication in health care, preceded by Listening for What Matters: Avoiding Contextual Errors in Health Care, by Saul Weiner and Alan Schwartz.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.gregjenner.com/" target="_blank">Greg Jenner&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250089441/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">A Million Years in a Day: A Curious History of Everyday Life from Stone Age to Phone Age</a> (St. Martins Press, 2016), explores the history of the modern material world through the lens of a typical Saturday in the twenty first century. Jenner gives his readers a fascinating look at our daily routines from the medical origins of corn flakes to the ecclesiastical origins of the newspaper. Beginning with the ring of an alarm clock, Jenner explores historical conceptions of time with many humorous and illuminating facts from sources as diverse as French Revolution to the Harappan Civilization of the Bronze Age. Ambitious in its scope and always dedicated to giving his readers a good laugh, Jenner takes a lighthearted look at the improbable people, fortuitous accidents, and unusual places that helped create our modern material world. Jenner&#8217;s book closes the historical distance between the lives of earlier epochs. Jenner shows the familiar struggles of domestic life are not unique to our own time, but rather shared throughout human history. Whether the Neolithic, medieval, or otherwise, Jenner shows how our ancestors responded to the shared problems of the everyday from setting an alarm clock to cooking breakfast. Jenner also points out that many successful inventions were lost and then rediscovered (such as sewage systems and the Roman bath), questioning popular notions of the linear path of technological development.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When clinicians listen to patients, what do they hear? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190228997/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Listening for What Matters: Avoiding Contextual Errors in Health Care</a> (Oxford UP, 2016), <a href="http://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/cms/One.aspx?pageId=12061364" target="_blank">Saul Weiner</a> and <a href="http://ulan.mede.uic.edu/alansz/" target="_blank">Alan Schwartz</a> provide a riveting account of a decade of research on improving outcomes by incorporating patients&#8217; individual life contexts into planning of care.<br />
Their groundbreaking studies showed that physicians, while getting the biological details largely correct, frequently disregard personal circumstances that lead to medical errors. Such an assertion might appear intractable or unfit for empirical study, but Listening for What Matters describes a series of creative experiments that strongly support it. From placing fake patients into real clinical contexts to measure the appropriateness of recommendations, to recording interactions between real patients and doctors (for which they developed a system, Content Coding for Contextualization of Care), and finally training groups of medical students to ask about individual context, Weiner and Schwartz build a case for the existence of a widespread problem while simultaneously offering compelling solutions.<br />
This is the first of a pair of interviews on communication in health care, to be followed by Samuel Morris Brown&#8217;s Through the Valley of Shadows: Living Wills, Intensive Care, and Making Medicine Human.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

While providing the first in-depth history of the Lafargue Clinic (1946-58), the book focuses on the figures who came together in a seemingly unlikely union to found it: Richard Wright, the prominent author; Fredric Wertham, a German Jewish emigre psychiatrist now known for his advocacy for censorship of comic books; and The Reverend Shelton Hale Bishop, an important Harlem pastor. Wright&#8217;s literary prowess, work for the Communist party, and brush with Chicago School sociology met with Wertham&#8217;s socially-conscious and uncompromising brand of psychoanalysis to challenge mainstream psychiatric theory and its discriminatory practices in the Jim Crow North. Those who could afford it were charged 25 cents for sessions in the basement of St. Philip&#8217;s Episcopal church in Harlem, and 50 cents for court testimonials. A thoroughgoing grassroots effort, ignored by philanthropists and state funding, the Lafargue Clinic throws mid-20th Century mental health and race relations into relief, and is sure to stir interest in the untold stories of projects like it.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/microbins/" target="_blank">Michael F. Robinson</a>&#8216;s new book is such a pleasure to read, I cant even. It&#8217;s not just because you get to say Gambaragara over and over again if you read it aloud. (I recommend doing this, even if just with that one word.) It&#8217;s not just because its a beautifully crafted work of prose. And it&#8217;s not just because its quite literally a page-turner. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199978484/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists, and the Theory that Changed a Continent </a>(Oxford University Press, 2016) is also a masterful biography of an idea: the life story of the Hamitic hypothesis and its relationship to to the histories of exploration, science, ideas of human origins, and much much more. Robinson&#8217;s book opens with an account of reporter David Ker going to the London mansion of Henry Morton Stanley in 1885 to interview the man who was at that point the world&#8217;s most famous explorer. (As Robinson puts it, Stanley resided in London, but in truth he lived nowhere.) As the story unfolds we learn about Stanley&#8217;s encounter with the white race of Gambaragara and its imbrication with a set of larger questions (Where did the human species originate? Why had it split into separate races? And how had these races come to settle the different regions of the planet?) as we meet some fascinating and compelling figures. The Lost White Tribe also has mummies, ruins, skulls, adventure fiction, and Freud. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this interview, <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/katie-gentile">Dr. Katie Gentile</a> discusses the research, writing and creative thinking about compulsory parenthood and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (or ARTs) that animate the essays appearing in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Business-Being-Made-temporalities-psychoanalysis/dp/0415749417/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464374422&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=KATIE+GENTILE">The Business of Being Made: The Temporalities of Reproductive Technologies in Psychoanalysis and Culture </a>(Routledge, 2015).  It is striking that while personhood amendments proliferate and sovereignty over the reproductive body shifts frighteningly more and more to the State, a global, bio-medical industrial complex has arisen comprising ARTs, surrogate pregnancy, egg/sperm donation and the like. Gentile points out the rise of the post-9/11 fetishization of the fetus a receptacle for all our vulnerabilities which must be protected at all costs in the face of the hyper-object: the threat of global catastrophe looming large. ARTs and its associated industries manufacture hope and optimism in conceiving babies at any cost (for those of privilege) while serving to further elevate, protect and fetishize the fetus. It&#8217;s a space of repro-futurity in which life is constructed around achieving reproductive milestones. ARTs have become another neoliberal trope to imagine life without limits as they have been subsumed into ordinary medicine for all women. With ARTs there is often no space to acknowledge loss, shame, uncertainty and the sexual re-traumatization that often occur during the process. On the plus side, ARTs offer the promise and opportunity of biological parenthood to marginalized people (for example, trans men) resulting in diverse family configurations. Gentile asks can other spaces be nurtured so that babies are not the main focus of generativity, especially for women? How can we better theorize childfree lives of creativity that are not seen as displaced parenting but generativity for its own pleasure?<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/rebecca-lemov" target="_blank">Rebecca Lemov</a>&#8216;s beautifully written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300209525/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Database of Dreams: The Lost Quest to Catalog Humanity</a> (Yale University Press, 2015) is at once an exploration of mid-century social science through paths less traveled and the tale of a forgotten future. The book is anchored around the story of Harvard-trained social scientist Bert Kaplan, who embarked on, in her words, a dizzyingly ambitious 1950s-era project to capture peoples dreams in large amounts and store them in an experimental data bank. While unique in scope, Kaplan&#8217;s project can be characterized as the culmination of efforts to apply techniques of personality capture&#8211;projective testing, dream analysis, and life history&#8211;in cross-cultural research on indigenous peoples, an effort to account for the full spectrum of human life amidst the encroachment of modernity upon cultures based, for example, in oral traditions.<br />
Richly documenting the entanglements of Kaplan and others in their attempts to render subjects as data, Lemov throws the transactional nature of anthropology into relief. A data point for an ethnographer can be many things for a research subject: cash for buying American niceties, a beer, a dream lost in the act of recounting, even a permanent mark of distrust. The book is also a history of a technology which never came to fruition: the futuristic reader for Kaplan&#8217;s Microcards was never realized, and the boxes of cards became dispersed and lost their value as a total archive of human personality. Lemov argues that we would do well to regard the fate of Kaplan&#8217;s database as a parable for our age by calling attention to the information loss upon which the technologies of documentation that saturate our present rely. What, then, will become of our compressed audio files, forgotten social media accounts, and backup hard drives stashed in the back corners of drawers?<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/144629868X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Social Media for Academics</a> (Sage, 2016), <a href="https://markcarrigan.net">Mark Carrigan</a>, from the <a href="http://socialontology.org">Centre for Social Ontology</a>, offers an informed and reflective take on social media, with some practical guidelines for academics. The book introduces key concepts, such as digital scholarship, social media and &#8216;the public&#8217;, alongside discussions of specific platforms including twitter (Mark himself tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/mark_carrigan">@mark_carrigan</a>). The book is not only a guide for academics who are interested in social media, as it considers the impact of new media forms on scholarship itself, with considerations of academic identities, academic networks and relationships, as well as the benefits and risks of embracing social media.The book is essential reading for any academic seeking an informed understanding of both the &#8216;how to&#8217; and, perhaps more importantly, the &#8216;why&#8217; and &#8216;what&#8217; of social media for academics.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Urban zoos are both popular and imperiled. They are sites of contestation, but what are those contests about? In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691164355/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">American Zoo: A Sociological Safari</a>(Princeton, 2015), ethnographer <a href="https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/david_grazian">David Grazian</a> tracks the competing missions of zoos as site of education, entertainment, philanthropy, and work. Grazian coins the term nature making to describe the process through which people assert and police an imagined division between nature and culture. On his sociological safari as a dung-shoveling, insect-eating volunteer at two urban zoos, Grazian observes how a range of stakeholders including visitors, employees, and corporate donors all participate in nature-making. Yet these groups make nature in different, patterned ways, which spawns everyday controversies as well as broader struggles to manage zoos rival missions. These contradictions shape what people learn in zoos (no evolution, please), how they imagine distant people and places (often crudely), and how species, both human and nonhuman, interact in zoos and in the wider world. American Zoo affirms the importance of urban ethnography for studies of organizations, science, and culture. Plus, in an age of irony, the book is constructive not only critical. With both laughter and bite, Grazian models how to sustain ambivalence as well as hope.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1785351559/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Enjoying It: Candy Crush and Capitalism</a> (Zero Books, 2015), <a href="http://www.hsmc.edu.hk/?option=com_departments&amp;dep=hum&amp;sid=61&amp;staff=817" target="_blank">Alfie Bown</a>, a lecturer at Hang Seng Management Colle<a href="http://www.hsmc.edu.hk/?option=com_departments&amp;dep=hum&amp;sid=61&amp;staff=817">g</a>e and co-editor of <a href="https://www.everydayanalysis.com">Everyday Analysis</a> and the <a href="https://hkrbooks.com">Hong Kong Review of Books</a>, talks through the political potential of new forms of enjoyment. Using Candy Crush Saga, Football Manager, Gangnam Style, Game of Thrones, and the act of reading critical theory itself, the book argues we need to take enjoyment seriously. Enjoyment is understood in relation to work and capitalism, unpacking ideas of productive and unproductive enjoyment and how they might serve or subvert power and control in modern life. The book will be of interest to scholars across philosophy, literary studies, and the social sciences, alongside anyone with a smart phone, tablet or love of the television box set!<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.umass.edu/history/people/faculty/schmalzer.html" target="_blank">Sigrid Schmalzer</a>&#8216;s new book is an excellent and important contribution to both science studies and the history of China. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022633015X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Red Revolution, Green Revolution: Scientific Farming in Socialist China</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016) reframes how we understand the relationships between science and politics in history by looking closely at the &#8220;unique intersection&#8221; of the red and green revolutions in modern China. Thoughtfully integrating a source base that includes interviews, propaganda works, films, memoirs, hand-copied underground novels, and more, Schmalzer offers a history of socialist Chinese agricultural science that is at the same time critical and empathetic. One of the core premises of the book is that &#8220;scientific farming meant different things to different people,&#8221; and so the chapters offer insights into the experiences of very different people and places in order to offer readers multiple entry-points into this crucial period of the history of science and modernity. The book&#8217;s analysis hinges on the importance of a productive binary of tu (here, a constellation of meanings that include &#8220;native, Chinese, local, rustic, mass, crude&#8221;) and yang (a constellation of &#8220;foreign, Western, elite, professional, ivory-tower&#8221;), following the work of individuals and groups of various sorts and sizes in navigating, producing, and troubling this binary. The chapters not only offer sensitively-wrought case studies of particular sites and contexts of socialist and post-socialist Chinese history, but also speak directly to a number of key debates and concepts that currently animate the field of STS. This is absolutely first-rate work that is highly recommended for anyone interested in the histories of modern science and/or China.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Teenagers live in their phones. As an educator you can try to pull them away or meet them where they are. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421418746/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The 160-Character Solution: How Text Messaging and Other Behavioral Strategies Can Improve Education</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) urges educators to meet teens on their must-have device.<br />
Author <a href="http://batten.virginia.edu/school/people/benjamin-castleman" target="_blank">Benjamin Castleman</a> of the University of Virginia shows how text messaging combined with insights from behavioral scienceâ€•more specifically the fields of behavioral economics and social psychologyâ€•can be leveraged to help students complete assignments, perform to their full potential on tests, and choose schools and colleges where they are well positioned for success.<br />
In his own research, Castleman has studied how to use personalized text messages to reduce &#8220;summer melt,&#8221; in which up to 40 percent of high school graduates who have been accepted to college, mostly from underserved communities, fail to show up for the fall semester.<br />
Behavioral strategies extend beyond texting and even beyond smartphone technology. By focusing on behavioral changes, Castleman demonstrates that small tweaks in how we ask questions, design applications, and tailor reminders can lead to better decision making and have remarkable impacts on student and school success. The 160-Character Solution makes a broader case for employing these behavioral strategies to improve educational outcomes from preschool all the way to college.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Thanks to mobile phones, getting online is easier and cheaper than ever. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262029928/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">After Access: Inclusion, Development, and a More Mobile Internet</a> (MIT Press, 2015), <a href="http://jonathandonner.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Donner</a> challenges the optimistic narrative that mobile phone will finally close the digital divide. How we log on, how long we stay, what we choose to do, what we can do &#8211; all are shaped by our environments, resources and digital literacies. After Access examines the implications of the shift to a more mobile, more available Internet throughout the developing world. Donner addresses these implications specifically for socioeconomic development and broad-based inclusion in a global society. He offers a note of caution about the Panglossian views of mobile phones arguing that access and effective use are not the same thing, and the digital world does not run on mobile handsets alone.<br /><br />
Donner, a Senior Director of Research at Caribou Digital, a UK-based consultancy focused on building inclusive digital economies in the developing world. After Access draws on ethnographic and survey research in South Africa and India, as well as the burgeoning literature from the ICT4D (Internet and Communication Technologies for Development) and mobile communication communities. It introduces a conceptual framework for understanding effective use of the Internet by those whose &#8220;digital repertoires&#8221; contain exclusively mobile devices. In showing that there is no singular internet experience, Donner argues that both the potentialities and constraints of the shift to a more mobile Internet are important considerations for scholars and practitioners interested in internet use in the developing world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In its introduction, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822359707/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Gut Feminism</a> (Duke University Press, 2015) lays out two major ambitions: it seeks &#8220;some feminist theoretical gain in relation to how biological data can be used to think about minded and bodily states,&#8221; and seeks &#8220;some feminist theoretical gain in relation to thinking about the hostility intrinsic to our politics.&#8221; The book shows that the gut is an organ of the mind via an exploration of melancholia, depression, some fascinating psychoanalytic literature, and contemporary conversations and debates about psychopharmaceuticals. Wilson&#8217;s book unflattens biology, offering an incredibly helpful way to think about anatomy as an ever-changing site of entanglement that enacts &#8220;malleability, heterogeneity, friction, and unpredictability.&#8221; Highly recommended!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

After defining metadata-data that has the potential to provide information about an object-Pomerantz considers the various kind of metadata. This raw material provides descriptions about individuals and most every other thing in the world. This data allows people, places, and things to be found. According to Pomerantz, metadata has become infrastructural as it plays such a pivotal role about in all of the things we do, yet, it is invisible. This invisible foundational material is created and collected all the time, and has vast implications for governments, corporations, and individuals.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

We follow Berkowitz not only into the pages of the works that made Bell famous, but also into the classrooms in which Bell advocated a pedagogy that trained hand and eye together and developed his interest in systems of all sorts, including the nerves, education, and display. Readers will learn about the growth of a new genre of medical weeklies that changed the public face of medicine, the founding of new institutions that changed the teaching of medicine, and the controversy over motor and sensory nerves that accompanied major transformations in the medical science of Bell&#8217;s lifetime. It is a fascinating story that honors the importance of the history of education in shaping the histories of science and medicine.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.colby.edu/directory/profile/prjoseph/">Paul R. Josephson</a>&#8216;s new book explores everyday technologies &#8211; fish sticks, sports bras, sugar, bananas, aluminum cans, potatoes, fructose, and more &#8211; as technological systems that embody vast social, political, cultural histories within relatively small packages. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421417839/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Fish Sticks, Sports Bras, and Aluminum Cans: The Politics of Everyday Technologies</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) traces some major themes through a series of fascinating and engagingly written case studies. As readers explore the chapters, we learn that fish sticks (the &#8220;ocean&#8217;s hot dog&#8221;) were created less as a result of consumer demand, and more as a result of over-production thanks to new technologies related to fishing, refrigeration, materials science, the postwar kitchen, and more. We learn about the invention of the sports bra as a story of &#8220;reverse gender engineering&#8221; that involved the transformation of jock straps. We learn of the colonial and postcolonial histories &#8211; of slavery, exploitation, technological innovation &#8211; staring back at us every time we look at a banana or an aluminum can. We learn to see French fries and high fructose corn syrup as &#8220;self-augmenting technologies.&#8221; We learn that there&#8217;s nothing strictly &#8220;natural&#8221; about natural disasters. And we are offered a glimpse into the use of large-scale technologies as symbols of state power in Russia. The book concludes with two more stories &#8211; of books and bicycles &#8211; that leave us with important lessons to take away from the book after we put it down. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book is a pragmatic philosophical exploration of climate change and the human response to it at the same time that it provides a clear scientific, conceptual, and economic history of the issues involved. Ultimately, the book asks how to &#8220;live in productive relationship with the dynamic systems that govern a changing planet&#8221; (180). Our conversation covers the obstacles to action on climate change, competing economic approaches to addressing climate change, the needed ethical and moral resources, a reflection on the 2015 Paris talks, and more.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When we consider the television, we think not only about how it&#8217;s used, but also it&#8217;s impact on culture. The television, tv, telly, or tube, became popular in the West in the late 1940s and early 1950s and was seen as a form of entertainment and enjoyment for the family. Other &#8220;technology&#8221; that assists with leisure include things like rubber-soled shoes, books, and other digital devices. In their new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enjoying-Machines-Barry-Brown/dp/0262028786">Enjoying Machines</a> (MIT 2015), <a href="http://barbro.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Barry Brown</a> and <a href="http://mobility.dsv.su.se/people/oskar-juhlin/" target="_blank">Oskar Juhlin</a>, both scholars in the <a href="http://www.mobilelifecentre.org/">Stockholm University Mobile Life VINN Excellence Center</a>, the success of a particular technology can be measured by how well it creates pleasure.<br />
The authors argue that pleasure &#8220;is fundamentally social in nature,&#8221; and that to understand how technology supports leisure it is important to &#8220;produce a more sophisticated definition&#8221; of enjoyment. To do this Brown and Juhlin embark on an ethnographic investigation of technology and enjoyment that combines the sociological study of activity and the study of human-machine interaction. Over the course of their examination, the authors are careful to consider both the positives &#8211; enjoyment &#8211; and negatives &#8211; addiction- in relation to devices. Ultimately, Enjoying Machines offers a model of enjoyment useful for better understanding how to design useful machines.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Humans have coped with tragedy using ritual and memorials since the Neolithic era. Doka called a memorial a space invested with meaning, &#8220;set aside to commemorate an event such as a tragedy.&#8221; Memorialization is a ritual of bereavement, the creation of a place, permanent or not, that facilitates the persistence of memory. This space allows for the restructuring of the social network between the living, those who create the memorial, and the dead, those for which the memorial is created.<br />
Memorialization happens in both the analog and digital contexts. In fact, some now decline to recognize a distinction between the on- and offline worlds. In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137465360/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Journalism and Memorialization in the Age of Social Media </a>(Palgrave MacMillan, 2015), <a href="https://www.coker.edu/directory/pgloviczki.html">Peter J. Gloviczki</a>, an assistant professor at <a href="https://coker.edu/">Coker College</a>, conceptualizes online memorials as networked remembrance spaces. These social media posts and groups are &#8220;immediate, interactive and public and they function across a great distance.&#8221; Online memorials are both user-driven &#8211; the users drive the conversations and are responsible for keeping up the sites &#8211; and story-driven &#8211; the sites are places where users tell stories related to the subject(s) of the memorial.<br />
Thorough, fact-based journalism plays an important role in the maintenance of online memorials. According to Gloviczki, news reports provide the foundation for the discussion of events, as well as being central to making sense of those events. So significant is journalism for online memorials that, in some cases, a memorial will cease once coverage of that event ends. But many online memorials continue long after media interests concludes. The persistence of these sites demonstrates how online memorials &#8220;disrupt the notion of a finite end.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The genre of &#8220;platform studies&#8221; offers both researchers and readers more than an examination of the technical machinations of a computing system. Instead, the family of methodologies presents a humanist exploration of digital media from the perspective of the platform itself. That is, this approach contemplates the social, economic and cultural influence and significance of the technology. Although more formally identified by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort in 2007 at the Digital Arts and Cultures Conference,  the decades old platform studies discipline affords an understanding of the material manifestations of culture and creative work produced by computing systems.<br />
In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262028778/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">I Am Error: The Nintendo Family Computer Entertainment System Platform</a> (MIT Press, 2015), <a href="http://metopal.com/">Nathan Altice</a>, a digital media creator and scholar, studies the NES system and the Family Computer, it&#8217;s precursor. More than considering the NES as a single entity, the author investigates the platform as a &#8220;network of objects and texts,&#8221; that go beyond a &#8220;stable configuration of hardware and software.&#8221; In this way, Altice dives deep to unearth the code and design decisions that shape the creative affordances of the NES, how users choose to play using the platform, and how the system was received outside of Japan.<br />
The NES&#8217;s cultural reception is foundational for grasping a key theme throughout the book, that of &#8220;translation.&#8221; For Altice, translation produces errors &#8211; &#8220;new meanings, new expressions, new bodies, and new objects.&#8221; That is, the flaws in hardware and software, including the translation of language from Japanese to English, are not necessarily negative objects to be overcome. Instead, these bugs in the machine add to the performance of the games and the platform, and have very real social, economic, and cultural consequences.<br />
I Am Error is one book in the Platform Studies series from MIT Press.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[After reading Natasha Myers&#8217;s new book, the world begins to dance in new ways. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822358786/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Rendering Life Molecular: Models, Modelers, and Excitable Matter</a> (Duke University Press, 2015) is a sensory ethnography of protein crystallographers that is based on five years of fieldwork conducted between 2003-2008 at a research university on the East Coast of the US. &#8220;Protein modelers are the scientists to watch in order to see what forms of life and what materialities are coming to matter in the twenty-first-century life sciences,&#8221; according to Myers, and the book bears out this statement. Those forms of life and materialities emerge from kinesthetic and affective entanglements created and navigated by the scientists in the course of their modeling work. Understanding that work &#8211; in part thanks to a thoughtful exploration of the notion of &#8220;rendering&#8221; that unfolds over the course of the book &#8211; helps us understand the ways that scientific knowledge is fundamentally embodied and gestural, and refigures scientific cultures as performance cultures. This is an exciting, inspiring book that is simultaneously a careful study of a particular local scientific culture, and a model for how to re-enchant our knowledge of the living world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Belief in magic was pervasive in Greco-Roman times, persisted through the Renaissance, and then fell off the map of intellectual respectability in the Enlightenment. What happened? Why did it become embarrassing for Isaac Newton to have sought the philosopher&#8217;s stone, and for Robert Boyle to have urged the British Parliament to repeal a ban on transmuting base metals into silver and gold? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/110707052X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Magic in Western Culture: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2015), <a href="http://www.philosophy.ucla.edu/people/57-brian-p-copenhaver.html" target="_blank">Brian P. Copenhaver</a> shows that for millenia magic was taken seriously by the learned classes, sustained by a philosophical foundation drawn from Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. In this fascinating account of the historical conceptual framework of magic, Copenhaver, who is distinguished professor of philosophy and history at UCLA, explains the difference between good and bad magic, why Catholic Church fathers endorsed some magical beliefs (but drew the line at amulets and talismans), and how the rise of mechanistic philosophy transformed magic from being reputable to being a joke.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book is an exemplar of the kind of work that can come out of thoughtful and extended scholarly collaboration, here resulting from Tsing&#8217;s work with the <a href="www.matsutakeworlds.org" target="_blank">Matsutake Worlds Research Group</a>. The book treats matsutake mushrooms as objects and companions that are good to think with, offering an exuberant picture of what it might look like to live &#8220;in our messes&#8221; as parts of contaminated and contaminating multispecies worlds and assemblages. Tsing calls for renewed attention to the importance of &#8220;arts of noticing,&#8221; of curiosity, of play, of polyphony, of adventure. And at the same time as it accomplishes all of this, The Mushroom at the End of the World is deeply committed to telling stories, taking us into moments in the lives of individual smellers and sellers and pickers and tasters and bosses and crusaders. It is a wonderful work of ethnography that, in many ways, transcends genre and discipline.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today, sustainability is all the rage. But when and why did the idea of sustainable development emerge, and how has its meaning changed over time?<br />
<a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~intlweb/about/facprofile/smacekur.shtml" target="_blank">Stephen Macekur</a>a&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107072611/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Of Limits and Growth: The Rise of Global Sustainable Development in the Twentieth Century</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2015) explores this question by connecting three of the most important aspects of the twentieth century: decolonization, the rise of environmentalism, and the pursuit of economic development and modernization in the Third World. Macekura, who is an Assistant Professor of International Studies at Indiana University, demonstrates how environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) attempted to promote environmental protection in the post-colonial world, then, after failing to do so, challenged the economic development approaches of the United States, World Bank, and United Nations. The book reveals how environmental activists initially conceived of &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; as a way to link environmental protection with Third World concerns about equality and justice in the global economy, but how, over time, the phrase&#8217;s meaning moved far away from this initial conception.<br />
In addition to exploring the idea of &#8220;sustainable development,&#8221; Macekura also examines the growth and limits of the environmental movement&#8217;s power. He pays close attention to how international political disputes have scuttled major global treaties over issues such as climate change; he also documents the evolution of international development politics and policy since 1945. In sum, Of Limits and Growth offers a new history of sustainability by elucidating the global origins of environmental activism, the ways in which environmental activists challenged development approaches worldwide, and how environmental non-state actors reshaped the United States&#8217; and World Bank&#8217;s development policies.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.people.hps.cam.ac.uk/index/teaching-officers/hopwood" target="_blank">Nick Hopwood</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022604694X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Haeckel&#8217;s Embryos: Images, Evolution, and Fraud </a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) blends textual and visual analysis to answer the question of how images succeed or fail. Hopwood is Reader in History of Science at Cambridge University, and creator on the online exhibition &#8220;<a href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/visibleembryos/s4.html" target="_blank">Making Visible Embryos</a>,&#8221; which display some of the images from the book.<br />
Hopwood&#8217;s ambitious book retraces the social life of drawings of embryos first produced in 1868 by the German embryologist Ernst Haeckel. The book follows the turbulent travels of the images across 150 years and three countries. Some of the perennial controversy surrounding the images centered on debates about Darwinism, for in them Haeckel drew the development of human embryos alongside that of other animals and, in retrospect, seemed to illustrate his famous claim that &#8220;ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.&#8221; But Hopwood argues that, while Haeckel&#8217;s reputation has continued to suffer from repeated allegations of fraud, his images have actually thrived on controversy, appearing in 2010, for example, on the cover of Nature magazine. Hopwood&#8217;s far-reaching and intricate analysis explains how one of the most controversial images in the history of science&#8211;namely, Haeckel&#8217;s embryo grid&#8211;has also been one of its most successful. The book is an essential study in the history of images and is itself a masterpiece of visual argument.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

B. Tauris, 2015) begins by describing a fatwa against Pokemon and opens out into an introduction of the sensitive nature of discussions related to evolution and creation in the Gulf. The ensuing chapters approach and answer a major question: given this sensitivity, what enabled scientists to nevertheless employ evolution in the political, religious, social, and natural environments of the Gulf? At least part of the answer lies in the importance of networks between scientists, plants, princes, local tribes, European businesses, animals, and other historical actors. The history of those networks &#8211; and the botanical, zoological, ornithological, and paleontological research they enabled &#8211; is a transnational and transregional one, and looks carefully at concerns with conservation, climate change, and economies at multiple levels. Determann&#8217;s book avoids telling this story in terms of the common tropes of decline and stagnation, and seeks instead to &#8220;go beyond the wholesale and often negative views of scientific production in the contemporary Arab world.&#8221; Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Who made life risky? In his dynamic new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022625917X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">How Our Days Became Numbered: Risk and the Rise of the Statistical Individual </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2015), historian <a href="http://www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/dbouk" target="_blank">Dan Bouk</a> argues that starting in the late nineteenth century, the life-insurance industry embedded risk-making within American society and American psyches. Bouk is assistant professor of history at Colgate University, and his new book shows how insurers categorized individuals and grouped social classes in ways that assigned monetary value to race, class, lifestyles, and bodies. With lively prose, Bouk gives historical context and character to the rise of the &#8220;statistical individual&#8221; from the Guided Age to the New Deal. Bouk&#8217;s primary argument is that risks did not always already exist, nor was risk invented by the medical establishment. Instead, the threat (and reality) of economic crisis helped insurers to create risk as a commodity, and eventually to control the lives it measured. As Bouk phrases it in the interview, &#8220;Insurers improved their bottom line by improving Americans&#8217; bottom lines.&#8221; Bouk invites readers critically to reflect upon how we have come to see ourselves through a statistical lens in our daily lives&#8211; an issue of continued relevance in the age of big data and vast analytical capabilities.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

W. Norton, 2015) treats the commercial and advertising art of the mid-twentieth century as an archive to explore the social and cultural engagement with electronics technologies during a particularly vibrant moment for the American graphic commercial arts. Incorporating text and image as sources to be read, Prelinger&#8217;s book moves from the beginnings of FM technology and vacuum tubes, to televisions and quartz crystals, to transistors and circuit boards, to digital computing and into space. Of special interest is the attention Prelinger pays to to the importance of graphic designers and staff artists at major labs and research centers. The book models an innovative and inspiring way to read graphic images as historical documents, and the story is a pleasure to read for specialists and non-experts alike.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[By now it is incontrovertible that new technology has had an effect on how regular people get information. Whether in the form of an online newspaper or a Google search, new technology has allowed individuals to access masses of information faster than ever before. What, then, has been the effect of digital tools on research practices? In their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B011F71N6Q/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Knowledge Machines: Digital Transformations of the Sciences and Humanities </a>(MIT Press, 2015), <a href="http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/meyer/">Eric T.

To do this, Meyer and Schroeder use case studies to examine how new technology has, and continues to, change research in various fields, and what this means for the future of e-research.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.case.edu/faculty/peter-shulman/" target="_blank">Peter A. Shulman</a>&#8216;s new book is a fascinating history of the emergence of a connection between energy (in the form of coal), national interests, and security in nineteenth century America. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421417065/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Coal and Empire: The Birth of Energy Security in Industrial America</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) focuses on three groups who helped shape America&#8217;s relationship between energy and security: naval administrators and officers, politicians and policy makers, and scientists and engineers. In clear and persuasive prose, the book advances three main arguments that collectively reframe the way we understand the historiography of energy. First, Americans didn&#8217;t begin thinking about energy in terms of security around oil in the early twentieth century, but instead around coal in the nineteenth. Second, the security need for distant coaling stations in the late nineteenth century didn&#8217;t catalyze the emergence of an American island empire around 1898. Instead, it was the other way around: the establishment of an American island empire created new demands for coal and coaling stations. Third, technological change was integral to American foreign relations. Shulman&#8217;s book shows all of these and much more, in a story that moves from steam power and the postal system, to the development of notions of an economy of time and space, to Commodore Perry, to President Lincoln&#8217;s interest in setting up a colony of free blacks to the calculation of great circle routes, to the study of logistics in early twentieth century classrooms, to the Teapot Dome scandal, and beyond. The conclusion of the book discusses some of the most important ways that the arguments of the book are still relevant today, and pays special attention to the ideal of energy independence.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The journey begins with readers accompanying a dead body to sites of dissection across the city, after which we are introduced to four anatomists &#8211; charter members of the Paris Academy of Sciences &#8211; who will act as focal points for the rest of the story.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022624766X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Courtiers&#8217; Anatomists: Animals and Humans in Louis XIV&#8217;s Paris</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) opens up Parisian bodies &#8211; human and animal, dead and alive &#8211; to argue that dissection played a major role in the development of experimental methods in seventeenth century science. In Guerrini&#8217;s hands, the history of science and medicine in early modern Paris was simultaneously a history of fairy tales and opera, dogs and chameleons, artists and knife-makers, labyrinth-making and oratory. It is a fascinating book that is a must-read for historians of anatomy and of early modern science and medicine, and will be accessible and gripping for readers well beyond those fields.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Milburn explores the spaces of this world, from islands to Second Life to a NanoCity. Incorporating chapters that are counted in binary (0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, etc.) and clues to a game hidden inside the narrative (!), Milburn&#8217;s book embodies the kind of play that the book explores. It&#8217;s a fun and fabulous work that blends literature, STS, and history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

As such, it reveals how websites&#8211;and the communities of discourse that create and read them&#8211;have become important sites of intellectual production, authorship, and exchange. In editorial departments such as &#8220;In the Journals&#8221; and &#8220;Web Roundup,&#8221; authors distill recent scholarly contributions across disciplines and spaces. More recently, the editors have incubated creative digital endeavors such as <a href="http://somatosphere.net/commonplaces">Commonplaces</a>, a &#8220;collaborative cabinet&#8221; that itemizes the technological present, with entries devoted to topics such as the petri dish, the brain, and the waiting room. <a href="http://somatosphere.net/series/book-forum">Book Forum</a> invites commentary from a range of authors, representing not only different scholarly disciplines but offering intriguing, timely, and often original angles on recent important texts. Thanks to its editorial vision and the palpable energy of its contributors, Somatosphere has become informative, creative, and essential reading.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Life must have a father and mother&#8230;Science! I&#8217;m going to plant a bomb under its ass!&#8221;<br />
The author of the line above &#8211; who scrawled it in his private diary in the midst of a series of experiments in which he thought he was creating structures that were some kind of transitional stage between the living and nonliving &#8211; had quite a life. A &#8220;midwife to the sexual revolution of the 1960s&#8221; who was famed for his work on the science of orgasm, was widely maligned as a charlatan and pseudoscientist, did extensive work on the science of cancer, had his books and instruments publicly burned by the US government, and died in prison: it&#8217;s hard not to find Wilhelm Reich fascinating. In his new book, <a href="http://www.fandm.edu/james-strick" target="_blank">James E. Strick</a> reminds us that Reich was also a diligent and accomplished laboratory scientist whose work has potentially important implications for the modern biosciences. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674736095/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Wilhelm Reich, Biologist</a> (Harvard University Press, 2015) takes readers into the making of this modern scientist, from his early relationships with Freud and dialectical materialism, to his work on the orgasm as a kind of &#8220;electrophysiological discharge,&#8221; to his research into potential treatments for cancer. The book concludes by considering why understanding Reich&#8217;s scientific work matters for us today, including a brief introduction to some recent experimental work related to Reich&#8217;s research. It is an absorbing story that&#8217;s also a pleasure to read, and pays careful attention to Reich&#8217;s scientific work while still translating it in clear terms for non-specialist readers.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

She is an assistant professor of new media at Fordham University. Baldwin-Philippi&#8217;s book fits into a larger Oxford series on Digital Politics which has been featured on the podcast in the past. She uses an ethnographic approach focused on understanding how political campaigns in 2010 had incorporated various technologies. She also collects original data on specific digital strategies, especially social media. But the book is not just about technology; Baldwin-Philippi tries to understand how campaigns shape citizenship and democracy through the tools they use.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Indeed the question of value has a range of academic projects associated with it, whether in terms of <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/research/fundedthemesandprogrammes/culturalvalueproject/">specific questions</a> or in terms of <a href="http://valuationstudies.liu.se">emerging fora for academic publications</a>. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019968958X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Value Practices in the Life Sciences and Medicine</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015), <a href="http://katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N9-5">Isabelle Dussauge</a>, <a href="https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-t/medarbetare/helgesson-claes-fredrik?l=en">Claes-Fredrik Helgesson</a>, and <a href="https://www.tema.liu.se/tema-t/medarbetare/lee-francis?l=en">Francis Lee</a> bring together a range of authors to outline a new research programme. Alongside individual essays that range from the allocation of transplant organs, questions of plagiarism in science, the ownership of generically modified organisms though to desire and neuroscience, the book points to a new way to think through questions of valuation. As a result its importance moves beyond an STS audience to establish value practices as a vital framework for understanding contemporary life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book charts transformations not only of natural objects and studies of them in Japan, but also of the professional and social identity of scholars, the disciplinary identity of the field, the popular engagement with natural history, and the illustration of the natural world. The chapters are framed by epigraphs from some of the intellectual and philosophical touchstones of Marcon&#8217;s book &#8211; including Horkheimer, Adorno, and others &#8211; and the text weaves readings and echoes of these thinkers into inspiring readings of Japanese history. It is a must-read for historians of early modern science, natural history, and Tokugawa studies!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.history.ucr.edu/People/Faculty/Simmons/index.html" target="_blank">Dana Simmons</a>&#8216;s marvelous and thoughtful new book takes on a question that many of us likely take for granted: &#8220;What is a need; what is a want, a desire, a luxury?&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022625156X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Vital Minimum: Need, Science, and Politics in Modern France</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) offers an answer that emerges from and is embedded in the particular historical context of nineteenth century France, but has consequences that range well beyond modern French history. Early in this fascinating study, Simmons articulates an argument that threads through the book: &#8220;a science of human needs undergirded the modern wage economy and the welfare state.&#8221; That science was collaboratively built by a diverse community of agronomists, chemists, doctors, anthropologists, economists, sociologists, amateur data gatherers, trade unions, and others who collectively attempted to define and then measure human needs for the sake of better social organization. How to do this was not at all self-evident, and fierce debates were waged that challenged participants to rethink the most basic elements of a notion of society: What were the &#8220;needs&#8221; that must be fulfilled in order to keep persons productive? Were those needs physical and/or psychological? What were the characteristics of a model &#8220;person,&#8221; anyway? The chapters of the book narrate the traces that these debates left on the bodies of workers, the pages of history, and the basic notions (like &#8220;minimum wage,&#8221; like &#8220;citizen&#8221;) that make up modern conceptions of civil society. Highly recommended!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/kris/" target="_blank">Kristin Peterson</a>&#8216;s new ethnography looks carefully at the Nigerian pharmaceutical market, paying special attention to the ways that the drug trade links West Africa within a larger global economy. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/082235702X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Speculative Markets: Drug Circuits and Derivative Life in Nigeria</a> (Duke University Press, 2015) takes reads into a story that is part medical anthropology, part careful analysis of global economy, and shows that understanding one is vital to understanding the other in the modern West African pharmaceutical landscape. Peterson pays special attention to the Idumota market, an area that was strictly residential in the 1970s and has since become one of the largest West African points of drug distribution for pharmaceuticals and other materials from all over the world. Peterson looks at the consequences of major local and global historical factors in that transformation, including civil war in the late 1960s and migration that followed, a 1970s oil boom and bust, and changes in the global pharmaceutical market in the 1980s. By the early 1980s, Nigeria was deep into an economic crisis that had profound implications for the production, circulation, and marketing of pharmaceuticals. The pharmaceutical industry remade itself by becoming tied to the speculative marketplace, with wide-ranging implications that included the rise of new professional relationships &amp; market formations in Nigeria, new relationships with firms in China and India, new forms of speculation, and new questions about the ontology of markets. Peterson demonstrates that these transformations continue to have important consequences for the bodies of individual Nigerians, including major problems with drug resistance and a mismatch between existing drug therapies and existing diseases. The book avoids the usual discourse of corporate greed, instead focusing on the &#8220;structural logics of pharmaceutical capital through which corporate practices can be understood.&#8221; It is a timely and fascinating study.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://gseis.ucla.edu/directory/sandra-harding/" target="_blank">Sandra Harding</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022624136X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Objectivity and Diversity: Another Logic of Scientific Research</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015)  raises new questions about two central concepts in STS &#8211; objectivity and diversity &#8211; and in doing so it allows us to animate them in new kinds of relationships and shows that objectivity and certain forms of diversity can be mutually supportive. Harding does this in two major ways: by considering specific cases where science has been shaped by social values and interests and drawing conclusions about the &#8220;logical positivist legacy&#8221; from them; and by locating these issues within particular historical contexts. Though the &#8220;social&#8221; tends to be treated as an impediment to scientific research rather than a source of new resources and pathways, social and political movements have deeply shaped the practices and philosophy of science. Ch. 1 offers a historical context in which to understand the approaches that dominate today&#8217;s analytic philosophy of science, describing and analyzing the ways in which the social conditions for scientific research and its philosophy were created in two eras of significant institutional change: the postwar era of the 1940s-1950s, and the 1960s-1970s. Three science studies research fields that have emerged since the 1960s &#8211; science studies, postcolonial STS, and feminist STS &#8211; show that sciences and their societies co-produce and co-constitute each other and they deeply influence the project of the book and its remaining chapters. Ch. 2 &#8211; 7 explore six major arguments for the claim that the &#8220;social norm of diversity and the epistemic norm of objectivity can provide mutual support for each other&#8221; and they introduce helpful case studies that both illustrate Harding&#8217;s arguments and model a methodology for bringing about the kind of integration of philosophy and socially-aware STS that the book advocates. It&#8217;s a wonderful, clear read and is highly assignable in undergraduate and graduate courses devoted to science, policy, philosophy, and/or STS!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The role of financial services in individuals&#8217; and communities&#8217; everyday lives is more important than ever. In <a href="https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415694391">Devising Consumption: Cultural Economies of Insurance, Credit and Spending </a>(Routledge, 2014), <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/main/staff/people-profile.php?name=Liz_McFall">Liz McFall</a> charts the rise of one particular element of financial services, door-to-door sales, to understand the role of insurance and credit in society. In doing so McFall aims to &#8216;ventriloquise the lives and consumption practices of the silent poor&#8217;, as well as charting a the history of a very neglected element of the story of finance&#8217;s role in contemporary life. The book contains a wealth of historical data, alongside a theoretical engagement with the meaning of &#8216;the device&#8217; within current social theoretical literature. Moreover the book offers reflections on the role and workings of markets and states, both with regard to finance and more broadly to the government of social life. The combination of these perspectives offers an important new lens through which to understand the sociology of consumption and thus, more generally, the social world itself.<br />

Whitmer</a>&#8216;s new book offers a history of science set in the Halle Orphanage, a building that was founded in the middle of the 1690s in the Prussian city of Halle by a group of German Lutherans known as Pietists. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022624377X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Halle Orphanage as Scientific Community: Observation, Eclecticism, and Pietism in the Early Enlightenment</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015)  understands this orphanage as a scientific community, thereby countering a tendency to approach the history of science in a way that treats science and religion and distinct and oppositional endeavors, and problematizing previous ways of understanding the space as an enclave of Pietists who were &#8220;enthusiastically opposed to rational approaches to knowing the natural world, and to science and the Enlightenment more generally.&#8221; As the fascinating story unfolds, Whitmer&#8217;s account meaningfully contributes to histories of observation, material culture, models and modeling, and education.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In answering that question, Empires of Coal looks carefully at the importance of mining (including state management and legal regulation thereof) to the political economy of late imperial China. As geology developed into an independent discipline separate from geography, it help colonizers cement their power by aiding efforts to extract valuable mineral deposits from the colonies. Wu traces the archive produced in this context as coal became crucial not just to foreign interest in China, but also to China&#8217;s interest in mineral resources, exploring a wide range of maps, translations, letters, essays, journals, textbooks, and other materials. The book also situates this story within a history of mineral sciences, scientists, and engineers in China. It will be required reading for anyone interested in the entanglement of science, technology, and modernity in global history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book revises what we think we know about the infrastructure of global networks: they are not &#8220;wireless,&#8221; but wired; not rhizomatic and distributed, but semicentralized; not deterritorialized, but &#8220;territorially entrenched&#8221;; not resilient, but precarious and vulnerable; and not urban, but rural and aquatic. After providing a broad overview of three major eras of cable development &#8211; the copper cables of the 1850s-1950s, the coaxial cables of the 1950s-1980s, and the fiber-optic cables of the 1990s on, in each case focusing on the importance of security, insulation, and interconnection &#8211; Starosielski analyzes how cables have become embedded into existing natural and cultural environments in a number of specific sites in Hawai&#8217;i, California, New Zealand, British Columbia, Tahiti, Guam, Fiji, Yap, and beyond. Countering the rhetorical pull of terms like &#8220;flow&#8221; that tend to provoke an approach to media that is deterritorializing and dematerializing, Starosielski instead turns readers&#8217; attention to the ecological dimension of media and the fixed, material investments grounding today&#8217;s communication networks. It is a brilliant book that deserves a wide readership.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Drugs exist that are meant to help people feel better. The doctors who prescribe them might believe that they work, while their patients do not. In explaining the drugs to their patients, should those doctors use the medical terminology they themselves use &#8211; which might not be immediately understandable to their patients &#8211; or should they translate the description into terms more comfortable and familiar to the patient? And what are the practical and ethical consequences of each decision? <a href="http://www.sps.ed.ac.uk/staff/social_anthropology/ecks_stefan" target="_blank">Stefan Ecks</a>&#8216; new book carefully considers these problems in the context of health-related practices in modern Calcutta. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814724760/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Eating Drugs: Psychopharmaceutical Pluralism in India</a> (NYU Press, 2013) looks successively at the different and overlapping medical and healing contexts that together make up a significant part of the medical marketplace in Calcutta. Ch. 1 treats popular notions that include the importance of the belly as the &#8220;somatic center of good health,&#8221; the power of the mind to regulate good health, and the connection between modernity and pollution as causes of illness. Ch. 2 looks at Ayurvedic practices in Calcutta. It reflects on some of the most important ways that Ayurveda is changing in India &#8211; especially at the levels of practitioner training, language, and the patient-physician relationship &#8211; despite the fact that the centrality of food and digestion has remained constant. Ch. 3 looks closely at homeopathy, the second most popular type of medicine in Bengal, and focuses on the principles, histories, and pluralities of homeopathic practices in Calcutta. Ch. 4 looks at the ways that Calcutta psychiatrists position themselves with respect to popular beliefs about psychopharmaceuticals, general physicians, practitioners of non-biomedical treatments, and the pharmaceutical industry. This chapter pays special attention to how Bengali doctors use metaphors to help patients understand and respond to psychiatric diagnoses, with comparisons to nature, the Ganges river, fairytales, everyday over-the-counter drugs, diabetes, and food. The conclusion explores a key argument of the book, proposing that &#8220;patients&#8217; suspicions of psychopharmaceuticals are based on suspicions of biomedicine&#8217;s &#8216;magic bullet&#8217; model of drug effects,&#8221; looking at the implications of this conclusion, and considering the possible broader impacts of this study beyond Calcutta. It&#8217;s a fascinating study of potential interest to historians and anthropologists of medicine and healing, as well as readers interested in learning more about the medical marketplace of modern India and anyone interested in modern psychopharmaceuticals.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Callison explores meaning-making in these contexts in a series of beautifully written chapters that collectively narrate the forms of expertise and translation through which climate change comes to matter. The book pays special attention to the ways that these case studies can inform efforts to mobilize greater collaboration across multiple epistemologies, ethical imperatives, vernaculars, and social norms.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Due in part to lobbying efforts on behalf of the human genome project, human genes tend to be thought of in light of the present&#8211;genetic components of human disease and differential risks associated with genetic individuals&#8211;before the future, what gets passed on to later generations. However, public understanding of genetics did not merely radiate from laboratories, as <a href="http://www.minnastern.com/" target="_blank">Alexandra Minna Stern</a>&#8216;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421406683/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Telling Genes: The Story of Genetic Counseling in America </a>(Johns Hopkins University, 2012) shows. Before the age of genetic sequencing and mass-produced tests, physicians from various specialties provided genetic counseling on an ad-hoc basis, most of which took the form of reproductive advice. Medical genetics had only been established in the 1960s, with the shadow of eugenics still looming large over a field that was now more inclined toward description of heritable conditions than prescription of reproductive sanctions and sterilization. The founding of the first master&#8217;s program in genetic counseling in 1969 established the institutional and intellectual basis for a new kind of health care professional, one that would further the reorientation of medical genetics toward patient-centered care.<br />
Stern&#8217;s book connects this emergent professional identity to the broader history of genetic and eugenic programs in the United States. So, while this is a history focused on how the distinct profession of genetic counseling emerged as an alternative to traditional medical authority, it is firmly situated within the conflicts that have persistently plagued the development and application of human genetic knowledge. This orientation toward fundamental tensions is reflected by the book&#8217;s structure. While she begins with a historical overview of genetic counseling as a profession, the rest of the book is organized around issues; genetic risk and the questionable efficacy of disease apprehension; the politics of race inherent in population knowledge; the fundamental role played by disability in the understanding of inherited disorders; the gender politics of genetic counseling as a challenge to the medical establishment; therapeutic ethics; and the emergence of prenatal testing.<br />
This highly readable whirlwind tour through the complex ethical and historical landscape of genetic counseling rewards those new to the history of genetics by virtue of its accessibility, along with those more familiar through the vast amounts of new source material it blends in seamlessly with broader frames. If you enjoy this book, look out for a new edition of Eugenic Nation, Stern&#8217;s first book on the politics of eugenics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://janet.vertesi.com/" target="_blank">Janet Vertesi</a>&#8216;s fascinating new book is an ethnography of the Mars Rover mission that takes readers into the practices involved in working with the two robotic explorers Spirit and Opportunity. Based on two years of immersive ethnography from 2006-2008, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022615596X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Seeing like a Rover: How Robots, Teams, and Images Craft Knowledge of Mars</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) focuses on the visuality of the mission, exploring &#8220;how scientists and engineers on Earth work with the digital images&#8221; sent by their robots to make sense of Mars and to work together to explore it. Vertesi proposes a way of understanding image-making practices as a kind of teamwork: learning to see like a rover, here, is an embodied, skilled, social achievement. Building on Wittgenstein&#8217;s notion of seeing as, Vertesi conceptualizes these imaging practices in terms of an analytic framework of drawing as: the Rover scientists &#8220;use digital tools to draw Mars as consisting of different kinds of materials or surfaces, with implications for future viewings and for team relations.&#8221; From mapping Mars to robot funerals, it&#8217;s a wonderful study for readers interested in space exploration, visual studies, sociology, and STS alike!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When we study the history of a famous scientific figure &#8211; especially one that has gone on to become a cultural icon &#8211; we are dealing not just with a person, but also with an identity or series of identities that have been constructed over time. <a href="http://www.evahemmungswirten.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eva Hemmungs Wirten</a>&#8216;s new book looks carefully at the work that has gone into the making of Marie Curie (1867-1934) as an individual, a celebrity, an icon, and ultimately a brand. Three motifs that thread through the narrative of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022623584X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making Marie Curie: Intellectual Property and Celebrity Culture in an Age of Information </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2015), and they each form the basis for one of its chapters: the impact of intellectual property on science and research; the role of celebrity culture in shaping the image of the scientist; and the &#8220;question of how to organize scientific information as part of the modern infrastructure of knowledge.&#8221; It&#8217;s a compellingly argued book that&#8217;s also a pleasure to read.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[While museums, labs, and botanical gardens have been widely studied by historians of science, field stations have received comparatively little attention.<a href="http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Profile/r.debont.htm" target="_blank">Raf De Bont</a>&#8216;s new book rectifies this oversight, turning our attention to the importance of biological field stations in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in generating new scientific practices, theories, and networks. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022614206X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Stations in the Field: A History of Place-Based Animal Research, 1870-1930</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) focuses on the German- and French-speaking scientific community in Europe, looking at a number of influential case studies that collectively embody what de Bont calls a &#8220;station movement&#8221; in this period. Exploring the relationship between these field stations and a notion of &#8220;experimentalism&#8221; embraced therein, de Bont usefully undermines a tendency to focus on laboratories as sites of experimentation in the history of science. The stations ranged in kind from very technologically sophisticated marine labs to cabins in the woods, from urban Naples to the isolated beaches of France to the birdlands of East Prussia. Some of the practices cultivated at these sites spread into a wider political and intellectual economy, transforming disciplines and spaces of inquiry and education in the process. It&#8217;s a fascinating study that offers readers a more robust and complex understanding of the spaces of modern science and their entangled histories.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.tamu.edu/faculty/coopersmith.shtml" target="_blank">Jonathan Coopersmith</a>&#8216;s new book takes readers through the century-and-a-half-long history of the fax machine and the technologies that shaped and were shaped by it, from Alexander Bain&#8217;s 1843 patent to the computer-based faxing of the end of the 20thcentury. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421415917/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Faxed: The Rise and Fall of the Fax Machine </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) chronicles the transformations of fax wrought by a range of industries and technologies in the context of world wars and global economic changes. In Coopersmith&#8217;s able hands, the history of the fax machine substantively informs a number of fields and disciplines that might not seem immediately related to it: these include visual studies (as newspapers and the military helped drive the development of fax markets and technology thanks to the need for rapid transfer of images in times of war and beyond) and East Asian studies (as fax machines can be traced through the history of modern homes and businesses in Japan). Coopersmith tells a story of fax as a story of repeated failures that were nevertheless productive and germinal, whether they resulted from competition from other technologies and industries, compatibility problems in a fracturing market, or foundation-laying for the acceptance of the email and internet technologies that would ultimately surpass it. It&#8217;s a fascinating and elegantly told story of a technology that was, for many years, a constant element of the living and working spaces of many of our lives.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[According to sixteenth-century writer Moderata Fonte, the untapped potential of women to contribute to the liberal arts was &#8220;buried gold.&#8221; Exploring the work of Fonte and that of many other incredible women, <a href="http://www.udel.edu/fllt/main/Personnel/ActiveFaculty/mkray.html" target="_blank">Meredith K. Ray</a>&#8216;s new book explores women&#8217;s contributions to the landscape of scientific culture in early modern Italy from about 1500 to 1623. Women in this period were engaging with science in the home, at court, in vernacular literature, in academies, in salons, and in letters, and<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674504232/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank"> Daughters of Alchemy: Women and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy</a> (Harvard University Press, 2015) looks both at women&#8217;s practical engagements with science and with their literary engagements with natural philosophy.<br />
Ch. 1 brings us to the Romagna, and to the formidable Caterina Sforza&#8217;s experiments with alchemical recipes as compiled in a manuscript that exists today in only a single manuscript copy. Both recipes and secrets were forms of currency in this context, and Ch. 2 looks at the vogue for printed &#8220;books of secrets&#8221; in sixteenth century Italy. This chapter pays special attention to the influential Secrets of Alexis of Piedmont (1555) and the Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese, while also exploring the influence of books of secrets on other early modern literary genres including vernacular treatises, dialogues, and letter collections. Ch. 3 look at the literature of debate over women, or querelle des femmes that flourished in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, looking particularly closely at the intertwining discourses about women and science in Moderata Fonte&#8217;s writing of chivalric romance and dialogue, and in Lucrezia Marinella&#8217;s epic poetry and pastoral writing. Ch. 4 moves us to Padua and Rome, where women had begun, by the early seventeenth century, to participate in scientific discourse in more formal ways. Here, Ray looks closely at Camilla Erculiani&#8217;s letters on natural philosophy (1584) that defended women&#8217;s aptitude for science, and at her networking with scientific communities in Poland and her eventual questioning by the Inquisition. The chapter then turns to Margherita Sarrocchi&#8217;s work, her epic poem Scanderbeide, and her fascinating relationship with Galileo. It is a fascinating book that will be of interest to readers eager to learn more about the history of science, literature, and/or women in early modernity. If you listen closely to the interview, you&#8217;ll also hear me comparing Caterina Sforza to Doritos. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://jonathaneig.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Eig</a> is a New York Times best-selling author of four books and former journalist for the Wall Street Journal. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393073726/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Birth of the Pill: How Four Crusaders Reinvented Sex and Launched a Revolution</a> (W.W. Norton, 2014) gives us a lively narrative history of the development and marketing of the birth control pill. He presents us with four risk-taking outsiders whose path became intertwined in the pursuit of a reliable and simple contraceptive. The feminist Margaret Sanger, in her campaign for the rights of women, sought a reliable birth control method as a means to sexual and social liberation. The genius scientist Gregory Pincus&#8217;s research stretched the boundaries of law and ethics and tied him to the business interest of Searle pharmaceuticals. The wealthy socialite Katharine McCormick&#8217;s singular focus and funding kept the research going. The handsome promoter John Rock, a Catholic infertility doctor, was willing to go against his church&#8217;s teaching and provide untested drugs to desperate patients. The story begins in the radical and sexually freewheeling Greenwich Village of the early twentieth century. Eig follows Sanger&#8217;s crusade for birth control information, cultural change, scientific victories and defeats, and the marketing of what became the first FDA-approved contraceptive pill in 1960. This is a well-researched and riveting story of four exceptional people and a revolution in the intimate lives of women and men. The birth control pill forever changed how we think about marriage, sexuality, and parenting.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Secord</a>&#8216;s new book is both deeply enlightening and a pleasure to read. Emerging from the 2013 Sandars Lectures in Bibliography at the Cambridge University Library, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022620328X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Visions of Science: Books and Readers at the Dawn of the Victorian Age</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2014) is a fascinating exploration of books and their readers during a moment of intense transformation in British society. Secord brings us into a period of the nineteenth century when transformations in publishing and an expanded reading public helped create a wide-ranging conversation about science and its possible futures. Out of this utopian moment several works emerged that reflected on the practices and prospects of science, and Secord guides us through seven of them in turn: the dialogues of Humphry Davy&#8217;s Consolations in Travel, the polemic of Charles Babbage&#8217;s Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, John Herschel&#8217;s moralizing Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy, Mary Somerville&#8217;s mathematical On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences, Charles Lyell&#8217;s Principles of Geology, George Combe&#8217;s phrenological The Constitution of Man, Considered in Relation to External Objects, and Thomas Carlyle&#8217;s bizarre and wonderful Sartor Resartus. In each case, Secord pays careful attention to the physicality of books and the ways that their readers create and transform them. In addition to being great fun to read, the book will also be helpful for teachers putting together material for undergraduate lecture courses on the history of science and/or book history, and will find a happy home on syllabi for upper-level undergraduate or graduate seminars in the history of books and reading, the sciences and modernity, and many others.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What were Ottomans talking about when they talked about science?<br />
In posing and answering that question (spoiler: they were talking about people), <a href="http://soan.owu.edu/faculty.html" target="_blank">M. Alper Yalcinkaya</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022618420X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Learned Patriots: Debating Science, State, and Society in the 19th-Century Ottoman Empire</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015) introduces the history of science as discussed and debated by nineteenth-century Turkish-speaking Muslim Ottomans in Istanbul. The book compellingly argues that these discussions and debates were not so much about the nature of science than the characteristics of the &#8220;man of science&#8221; and his relationship to Ottoman identity. In the course of YalÃ§inkaya&#8217;s study, readers also learn about the economic and political transformations of nineteenth century Ottoman society, the changes wrought by the gradual integration of the Ottoman Empire into the world capitalist system, and the consequences of those changes for the Ottoman state and its relationship to education and the press. This is a fascinating book for anyone interested in the entangled histories of science and modernity, and the ways that particular forms of identity and subjectivity emerged from inscriptions of that entanglement. I especially recommend it to readers paying special attention to the histories of the press, language, and the state as they are bound up with nineteenth century science and technology.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sousanis" target="_blank">Nick Sousanis</a>&#8216;s new book is a must-read for anyone interested in thinking or teaching about the relationships between text, image, visuality, and knowledge. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674744438/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Unflattening </a>(Harvard University Press, 2015) uses the medium of comics to explore &#8220;flatness of sight&#8221; and help readers think and work beyond it by opening up new perceptive possibilities. It proposes that we think about unflattening as a &#8220;simultaneous engagement of multiple vantage points from which to engender new ways of seeing,&#8221; and beautifully embodies what it can look like to make that happen. Readers will find thoughtful reflections on the possibilities and constraints afforded by working and thinking with different kinds of verbal and visual language, including a consideration of comics as &#8220;an amphibious language of juxtapositions and fragments,&#8221; and some wonderful work on storytelling and imagination. The book includes a wonderful &#8220;Notes&#8221; section that offers some background on the inspiration behind many of the images (including Flatland, Calvino&#8217;s Six Memos for the New Millennium, Deleuze &amp; Guattari, and many others) a bibliography for further reading, and a series of maps of the structure of the book when it was a work-in-progress. It&#8217;s a fabulous book that is a pleasure to read and deserves a wide readership.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://womensstudies.berkeley.edu/about/profile/faculty/34" target="_blank">Charis Thompson</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262026996/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Good Science: The Ethical Choreography of Stem Cell Research </a>(MIT Press, 2013) is an important book. Good Science explores the &#8220;ethical choreography&#8221; of the consolidation of human embryonic stem cell research in the first decade of the twenty-first century, drawing important implications for the possible futures of stem cell research by looking carefully at its past and developing an approach to what Thompson calls &#8220;good science.&#8221; The book compellingly argues that &#8220;a high level of political attention to the ethics of the life sciences and biomedicine&#8230;is a good thing for science and democracy,&#8221; especially as we have now reached &#8220;the end of the beginning of human pluripotent stem cell research.&#8221;<br />
Part I of the book (Stem Cell Biopolitics) explores early attention to the embryo debate. Ch. 2 looks at stem cell research as it&#8217;s widely understood to engage ethical concerns, describing the &#8220;pro-curial frame&#8221; of stem cell research in the period under scrutiny, when promoting stem cell innovation involved aspirations to be pro-cure and there was an ethical focus on the procurement of stem cells and cell lines for research. Pt. II of the book (Stem Cell Geopolitics) looks at what happened domestically as the debate over stem cells moved from the federal to the state levels and back in the US, and then turns to consider transnational circuits that were crucial to those practices and conversations. Ch. 3 looks at three phases that made up the beginning of human pluripotent stem cell research in the US: the time around President Bush&#8217;s 2001 policy, the period when states &#8220;seceded&#8221; from that policy (exemplified by California&#8217;s Proposition 71), and the period around Obama&#8217;s 2009 policy. Ch. 4 looks at the transnational geopolitics of stem cell research in an era when stem cell research became increasingly international and research advocates were deeply concerned with international competition and &#8220;brain drain.&#8221; Thompson takes readers into laboratory environments in South Korea and Singapore in order to undermine a popular rhetorical binary of East/West that contrasted an &#8220;East&#8221; that had a pro-science spirit and lack of concern with the moral status of the embryo, and a &#8220;West&#8221; that had been taken over by anti-science religious fanatics and technophobes.<br />
Pt. III of the book (Thinking of Other Lives) looks carefully at questions of research subjecthood. Ch. 7 focuses on human-human relationships and practices of donation at a time when a number of norms came under renewed scrutiny &#8211; including altruism, anonymity, and the alienation of tissue from donors &#8211; and this led to the conclusion that the old model for donation wasn&#8217;t working. In this context, there were increasing demands for reciprocity in various forms, and Thompson considers various models in California that rethought the relationships between donor/recipient and biomaterial/bioinformation. Ch. 6 focuses on the logic of using animals as substitutive research subjects for human-focused research, and calling for a move away from using animals as research subjects and toward using in vitro systems instead.<br />
To do all of this, Thompson develops a methodology she calls &#8220;triage&#8221; which we talk about early in the interview. Good Science is a wonderful and critical book, and well worth reading and teaching widely!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

To do so, Sharp presents case studies of &#8220;Game Art,&#8221; &#8220;Art Games,&#8221; and &#8220;Artists&#8217; Games&#8221; in an explication of three communities of practice that provide the foundation for the discussion of games and art. Game Art examines the use of games as tools for the creation of art. Sharp, then, examines the Art Game movement that pushes video games into the domain of other humanistic art forms. Finally, Artists&#8217; Games examines the use of video games as an artistic medium that combines the aesthetics of artists and game developers. Sharp also discusses the potential for the the merging of the values of traditional artists and gaming communities.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The chapters of the book trace the forms of media (graphic, photographic, electronic, and digital) that have been crucial forensic mediation since the nineteenth century, a period when the accident became &#8220;technologically modern&#8221; and the relationship between progress and catastrophe was transformed by the rise of &#8220;forensic rationality.&#8221; A series of fascinating case studies guides readers through the nature and implications of this transformation by introducing the rise of the forensic engineer, the inscribing apparatus of Charles Babbage, the &#8220;black box&#8221; technology of the flight-data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder, and the high-speed cinematography that offered a way of mapping and making sense of vehicle collision in the 1950s. There are some extremely moving moments nestled in the narratives of these cases, including a must-read discussion of last words and cockpit voice recorders in Chapter 3. Forensic Media is not only a gripping read, but will make a great addition to the syllabi for upper-level courses that treat any combination of STS, technology studies, media studies, and studies of modernity<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[That privacy in the digital age is an important concept to be discussed is axiomatic. Cameras in mobile phones make it easy to record events and post them on the web. Consumers post an enormous amount of information on social media sites. And much of this information is made publicly available. A common question, then, is what can people truly expect to be be private when so much information is accessible. In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813060583/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Privacy in the New Media Age </a>(University Press of Florida 2015), <a href="http://www.law.ufl.edu/faculty/jon-l-mills" target="_blank">Jon L. Mills</a> (University of Florida, Levin College of Law), discusses another issue related to privacy in the digital environment: the conflict between privacy and freedom of expression. In so doing, Mills examines how the law, particularly in the United States, is always chasing advances in technology, and discusses how countries in the European Union have attempted to tackle this matter. Throughout the book he discusses famous court cases that illustrate the issues with privacy and new media in an attempt to come to a resolution for the dispute.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://depts.washington.edu/history/people/40" target="_blank">Benjamin Schmidt</a>&#8216;s beautiful new book argues that a new form of exoticism emerged in the Netherlands between the mid-1660s and the early 1730s, thanks to a series of successful products in a broad range of media that used both text and image to engage with the non-European world. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812246462/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Inventing Exoticism: Geography, Globalism, and Europe&#8217;s Early Modern World </a>(University of Pennsylvania Press, 2015) takes readers into the Dutch ateliers in which exotic geography was produced by bookmakers, paying special attention to frontispieces and other paratexts through which these editor-printer-booksellers created a new way of looking at the world. Picturing, here, was a kind of performance. Schmidt considers how the exotic, non-European body was produced not just in texts and pictures but also in a range of material arts that depicted the body experiencing pleasure and pain. The book concludes by looking ahead to the middle of the eighteenth century, when there was a backlash against exotic geography, and a call for more &#8220;order and method&#8221; in the geographical description of the world. Inventing Exoticism is a focused, gorgeously illustrated multi-media exploration of a topic of crucial importance to the history of the early modern world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In doing so, Jackson chronicles the challenges to the granting of property rights over materials that occur naturally, and the legal and policy arguments both for and against allowing patents on these materials.<br />
But the book is more than just an examination of the instability of patent law. On the contrary, Jackson provides an interdisciplinary examination of the history of CCR5, which analyzes the role of race, culture, medicine and other fields, to examine of the wider impact of science and science policy on society. Just listen.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[China&#8217;s automobile industry has grown considerably over the past two decades. Massive foreign investment and an increased scale and concentration of work spurred the creation of a new generation of autoworkers with increased bargaining power. At the same time, China entered the global competition in mass-producing automobiles at a stage when the level of that competition was very high and profit margins were very thin. The state, as a consequence, has restructured the industry and increased competition since the late 1990s, and this has forced Chinese automakers to move toward a &#8220;leaner &amp; meaner work regime,&#8221; according to <a href="http://www.cla.temple.edu/sociology/zhang/" target="_blank">Lu Zhang</a>&#8216;s new book. The result for autoworkers has been an increased intensity of work, reduced job security, stagnant wages, a lack of opportunities to advance, and an inferior status in a very hierarchical factory social order.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107030854/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Inside China&#8217;s Automobile Factories: The Politics of Labor and Worker Resistance</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2015)  explores one important consequence of this transformation, the emergence of &#8220;labor force dualism&#8221; (a divide between formal and temporary workers) as a central component of labor relations in the Chinese auto industry. Lu Zhang&#8217;s book is the fruit of 20 months of ethnographic research inside seven large auto assembly factories in six cities in China between 2004-2011 &#8211; spending at least two months in each factory &#8211; in addition to interviews with a range of workers and managers from those factories and archival research. She reminds us of the importance of reading this ethnography with a sensitivity to the specificity of China&#8217;s condition as a &#8220;state-led, late-industrializing nation with strong revolutionary and state-socialist legacies.&#8221; Tracing the roots and mechanics of labor unrest as it has emerged from those conditions, the book argues that widespread grassroots protests among autoworkers in China have succeeded, on some level: they&#8217;ve won workers wage increases, improved conditions on the shop floor, and pressured the government into enacting new labor laws and policy changes. Still, there is work to be done, and the book concludes by considering possible future scenarios for Chinese auto labor relations in the context of labor force dualism.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Struggles over information in the digital era are central to <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/355446">Tim Jordan</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745333664/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Information Politics: Liberation and Exploitation in the Digital Society</a> (Pluto Press, 2015). The book aims to connect a critical theoretical reading of the idea of information with the architectures and practices surrounding information. The text begins by setting out how information is not separated from contemporary struggles over liberation and exploitation and points towards the principles of information politics that guide the reader through an engagement with contemporary theories, including the work of Haraway and Deleuze. These principles then inform theories of networks, recursion and the affordances of technologies that are used, in turn, to account for the platforms and battlegrounds of informational politics. The book does not offer up information as a new master discourse for political struggles, but rather shows, through examples including Facebook, the ICloud, the iPad, online gaming, and hacktivism, how information can be connected to, and can shape, other areas of social contestation. The text will be of interest to anyone using the internet, in particular those concerned with who is control of that space and how it might be reimagined.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

From the screen on a mobile, to that on a tablet, or laptop, or desktop computer, screens appear all around us, full of content both visual and text. But it is not necessarily the ubiquity of screens that has societal implications. The significance is in how screens fundamentally change how we ingest information.<br />
In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199315760/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World </a>(Oxford University Press, 2015), <a href="http://www.american.edu/cas/faculty/nbaron.cfm">Naomi S. Baron</a>, professor of linguistics and Executive Director of the Center for Teaching, Research &amp; Learning at American University, asserts that despite the benefits of convenience and monetary savings, reading onscreen has many drawbacks. Using surveys of millennials in the United States, Japan and Germany, combined with anecdotes, and information from writers, Baron provides evidence of the impact of technology on reading, and thinking, in society.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0821420704/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Black Skin, White Coats: Nigerian Psychiatrists, Decolonization, and the Globalization of Psychiatry</a> (Ohio University Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.history.vt.edu/faculty/heaton.htm" target="_blank">Matthew M. Heaton </a>explores changes in psychiatric theory and practice during the decolonization of European empires in Africa in the mid-twentieth century. His story follows the transcultural Nigerian psychiatrists who tried to transform the discourse around and treatment of mental illness in both their local contexts and in global psychiatric circles. The decolonization of psychiatry, Heaton argues, had an &#8220;intensely cross-cultural, transnational, and international character that cannot be separated from local, regional, and national developments&#8221; (5). Heaton shows how, amid these contexts and changes, Nigerian psychiatrists actively participated in negotiating postcolonial modernity and the place of global psychiatry within it. The book begins by tracing the larger story from colonialism to postcolonialism: the first chapter offers an essential, incisive account of &#8220;Colonial Institutions and Networks of Ethnopsychiatry&#8221;; the second chapter lays out the decolonizing of psychiatric institutions and networks in the 1950s and 1960s, a story told mainly through the fascinating figure of Thomas Adeoye Lambo. In the remaining four chapters, Heaton narrows the aperture of historical lens to explore particular cases: Nigerian migrants in the UK who experienced psychiatric issues; debates about culture-bound syndromes such as &#8220;brain fag disease&#8221; and universality of psychiatric diseases; encounters between psychotherapists and &#8220;traditional&#8221; healers; and the ambivalence around the use and meaning of drug therapies by Nigerian psychiatrists. Black Skin, White Coats persuasively shows us that postcolonial psychiatry in particular and postcolonial modernity more broadly are best understood in terms of connectivity and interrelatedness rather than provincial dichotomies. In so doing, he also succeeds in bringing together scholarly areas such as African Studies, the history of medicine and psychology, and postcolonial studies.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Social media and digital technology now allow researchers to collect vast amounts of a variety data quickly. This so-called &#8220;big data,&#8221; and the practices that surround its collection, is all the rage in both the media and in research circles. What makes data &#8220;big,&#8221; is described by the v&#8217;s: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Volume refers to the massive scale of the data that can be collected, velocity, the speed of streaming analysis. Variety refers to the different forms of data available, while veracity considers the bias and noise in the data. Although many would like to focus on these details, two other v&#8217;s,validity and volatility, hold significance for big data. Validity considers the level of uncertainty in the data, asking whether it is accurate for the intended use. Volatility refers to how long the data can be stored, and remain valid.<br />
In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262028565/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Big Data, Little Data, No Data: Scholarship in the Networked World</a> (MIT Press, 2015), Professor <a href="http://christineborgman.info/" target="_blank">Christine L. Borgman</a>, Presidential Chair in Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, examines the infatuation with big data and the implications for scholarship. Borgman asserts that although the collection of massive amounts of data is alluring, it is best to have the correct data for the kind of research being conducted. Further, scholars must now consider the economic, technical, and policy issues related to data collection, storage and sharing. In examining these issues, Borgman details data collection, use, storage and sharing practices across disciplines, and analyzes what data means for different scholarly traditions.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://thomvandooren.org/" target="_blank">Thom van Dooren</a>&#8216;s new book is an absolute must-read. (I was going to qualify that with a &#8220;&#8230;for anyone who&#8230;&#8221; and realized that it really needs no qualification.) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231166184/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Flight Ways: Life and Loss at the Edge of Extinction</a> (Columbia University Press, 2014) is a beautifully written and evocative meditation on extinction. The book offers (and implicates us in) stories about five groups of birds &#8211; albatrosses, vultures, Little Penguins, whooping cranes, and Hawaiian crows &#8211; that build upon one another and collectively enable us to explore and re-imagine what, where, and how extinction is, and why that matters. Van Dooren emphasizes the importance of storytelling to understanding and inhabiting the world, and the book&#8217;s five &#8220;extinction stories&#8221; each bring to life the entanglements of avian, human, and other beings to ask readers to consider a series of questions that can best be explored, understood, and engaged through attentiveness to these entanglements. &#8220;What is lost,&#8221; van Dooren asks, &#8220;when a species, an evolutionary lineage, a way of life, passes from the world?&#8221; How does this loss mean, and what does it mean, within the particular multispecies community formed and shaped by that way of life? And how might storytelling, conceived as an act of witnessing, help draw us into new relationships and accountabilities within our multispecies communities? Flight Ways is deeply concerned with the ethical questions that emerge &#8211; and that must be sustained &#8211; in the course of thinking through these crucial questions, and it is committed to moving us away from a position of human exceptionalism as we work with and inside of that ethical troubling. Deeply interdisciplinary, van Dooren&#8217;s book brings together approaches in animal studies and the environmental humanities, but it speaks to and from many more fields.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439910340/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reverse Engineering Social Media: Software, Culture, and Political Economy in New Media Capitalism</a>  (Temple University Press, 2014) by <a href="http://www.robertwgehl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Gehl</a> (University of Utah, Department of Communication) explores the architecture and political economy of social media. Gehl analyzes the ideas of social media and software engineers, using these ideas to find contradictions and fissures beneath the surfaces of glossy sites such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter. The book draws upon software studies, science and technology studies, and political economy to contextualize the institutionalization of user labor in our growing social media landscape. Looking backward at divisions of labor and the process of user labor, he provides case studies that illustrate how binary &#8220;Like&#8221; consumer choices hide surveillance systems that rely on users to build content for site owners who make money selling user data, and that promote a culture of anxiety and immediacy over depth. Gehl also goes beyond a critique of these inherently undemocratic systems to outline proposals that can shape our collective online future for the better. An idealized social data system, he argues, should be &#8220;decentralized, transparent, encrypted, antiarchival, stored on free hardware, and geared toward collective politics over atomization and depth over immediacy and surfaces.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Developers-Dilemma-Videogame-Creators-Technology/dp/0262028190">Developer&#8217;s Dilemma: The Secret World of Videogame Creators </a>(MIT Press, 2014), <a href="http://caseyodonnell.org/">Casey O&#8217;Donnell</a>, an assistant professor in the department of Media and Information in the College of Communication Arts at Michigan State University, takes the reader inside the game development process. An ethnographic study of the people and the process of videogame creation, Developer&#8217;s Dilemma considers the interactions between engineers and designers, publishers and executives, all motivated to ship out the completed product to the public. The dynamics of these relationships are shaped by the organizations, policies, and the marketplace, leading to a system of creative and collaborative practice that is not always in balance.<br />
O&#8217;Donnell uses the imagery of the videogames in his book, breaking the chapters into levels that include &#8220;bosses&#8221; and final rants. Both the book design and O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s masterful storytelling provide much-needed insight into the obscure world of videogame development. Just listen.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Mark Smith</a>&#8216;s new book is a magisterial history of optics over the course of two millennia. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022617476X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">From Sight to Light: The Passage from Ancient to Modern Optics </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2015) suggests that the transition from ancient toward modern optics was accompanied by a turn in optical studies from a concern with explaining sight to a focus on light by optical scholars. The book argues that Kepler&#8217;s theory of retinal imaging was instrumental in this turn. In the course of an amazingly comprehensive narrative of optical studies from Aristotle through the seventeenth century, From Sight to Light offers clear and persuasive discussions of the historical understanding of color and of visual illusions, the use of mirrors as optical devices, the relationships between physical and psychological theories of visual perception, and the study of reflection and refraction. Smith pays special attention to explaining the mathematical bases of optical theories, and he highlights the formative role that Arabic scientists and translation played in the history of optics. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the history of sight, vision, light, and the study thereof<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The result is a fascinating history of the construction of vision and cognition after WWII that looks carefully at the impact of early cybernetics on American design, urban planning, psychology, political science, management, and governmentality. Along the way, readers are treated to explorations of the &#8220;smart city&#8221; of Songdo Korea, the 1964-65 World&#8217;s Fair, labs at MIT, tricks played on porpoises, images of Marilyn Monroe, experiments on frog eyes, gardens designed by Isamu Noguchi, and much more. It&#8217;s a deeply thoughtful, wonderfully trans-disciplinary book that&#8217;s also a lot of fun to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/anthropology/people/fulltime/lisastevenson" target="_blank">Lisa Stevenson</a>&#8216;s new book opens with two throat-singing women and one listening king. Whether we hear them sitting down to a normal night&#8217;s dinner (as the women) or stalking the pages of a short story from Italo Calvino&#8217;s Under the Jaguar Sun (as the king), listening to these voices can potentially transform our notion of listening itself, as well as our understanding of what a &#8220;self&#8221; is and could be. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520282949/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Life Beside Itself: Imagining Care in the Canadian Arctic </a>(University of California Press, 2014) shows us this by exploring formulations and practices of life, death, and care in a history and ethnography of Canadian policies and attitudes toward the Inuit during two epidemics, a tuberculosis epidemic (1940s-early 1960s) and a suicide epidemic (1980s-present). In juxtaposing those two cases, the book considers different forms of &#8220;care,&#8221; bureaucratic and otherwise. In her archival and ethnographic research, Stevenson works as a collector of images, paying careful attention to the ways that they give meaning to life itself, even and especially amid conditions of uncertainty and confusion. The first three chapters of the book trace the practices of anonymous care that characterized the two epidemics in question, considering how the Canadian North has functioned as a massive laboratory for transforming Inuit into Canadian citizens. Whether the biopolitical project operated on tubercular or suicidal subjects, Inuit people were conceptualized as serialized bodies that needed to be brought back to health. Life Beside Itself shows that despite this, Inuit were never fully made into biopolitical subjects: instead, we come to know the friends and acquaintances that animate Stevenson&#8217;s work as they cultivate multiple forms of life and of care. This is a beautiful and thoughtful book that will reward a wide range of readers, whether they come to it with an interest in health care and its histories, in the Canadian North, in forms of life and death, or simply in a moving and generously narrated story.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://kimberlyhamlin.com" target="_blank">Kimberly A. Hamlin</a> is an associate professor in American Studies and history at Miami University in Oxford Ohio. Her book from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022613461X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Eve to Evolution: Darwin, Science and Women&#8217;s Rights in Gilded Age in America</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2014), provides a history of how a group of women&#8217;s rights advocates turned to Charles Darwin&#8217;s evolutionary theory to answer the eternal &#8220;woman question.&#8221; Hamlin&#8217;s fascinating intellectual history uncovers how the new evolutionary science provided multiple arguments by which to advance the cause of women&#8217;s rights in the home and society. Many scholars are familiar with the Enlightenment, religious, and socialist origins of feminist thought. Hamlin suggests another significant strand of thought offered by the science of human origins. She argues that Darwinism, often with unorthodox interpretations, was effective in overturning a central ideological obstacle to women&#8217;s equality&#8211;the biblical story of Eve. Charles Darwin&#8217;s theory, against his own conservative views, turned upside down traditional ideas about women. Freethinkers, socialist, sexologist seized on evolutionary science to build arguments against recalcitrant traditional views. They asserted that their contemporary culture was a construct of erroneous ideas calling for change, in order to live in accordance to the evolutionary laws of nature. As &#8220;reform Darwinists,&#8221; Hamlin&#8217;s subjects stood against social Darwinism, religious teaching, and custom. Yet, evolutionary science under male control was deployed to reassert women&#8217;s subordination. Sex difference as interpreted by many male scientists pointed to female intellectual inferiority. Women, mostly outside the science establishment, called on the evidence of &#8220;woman&#8217;s experience&#8221; against claims of scientific men.Hamlin offers a lucid narrative of how a group of women intervened in a period between the demise of Eve, as the metanarrative for the meaning of womanhood, and the masculinist consolidation of evolutionary science.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Imperial Illusions describes and explains a range of visual images and objects that were meant to trick the eye and delight the viewer, from illusionistic murals in tombs and temples, to massive wall- and ceiling-mounted paintings, diagrammed treatises on optics and vision, copperplate engravings, and more. Not only do these illusions help us understand Qianlong &#8211; especially when read alongside his poems &#8211; but they also inform a broader history of Sino-European artistic and technological exchange and help broaden the very notion of &#8220;Chinese painting.&#8221; This trans-disciplinary book is relevant not just to the history of art and of the high Qing, but also to the history of science and technology!<br />

The chapters explore the significance of volcanic activity, cave geology, lightning, gemstones, the healing powers of amber, underwater cities, and much more as they inform how we understand the histories of painting, religious practice, entombment, and the work of authors including Virgil, Dante, and Leonardo Da Vinci, among others. A pair of chapters focuses particularly closely on demonstrating how analyzing Da Vinci&#8217;s art from the perspective of geology and botany has helped to identify and authenticate his work and that of his students.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Show me how it doos.&#8221;<br />
Such were the words of a young James Clerk &#8220;Dafty&#8221; Maxwell (1831-79), an inquisitive child prone to punning who grew into a renowned physicist known for his work on electromagnetism. After learning to juggle and conducting experiments on falling cats, Maxwell went on to have an intense conversion experience that brought him to evangelicalism. The young T.H. Huxley (1825-95), on the other hand, busied himself at &#8220;delivering sermons from tree stumps&#8221; as a young boy, before joining the navy, studying jellyfish, eventually launching an assault against the Anglican Church and gaining world renown as the biologist who was &#8220;Darwin&#8217;s Bulldog.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/ms5100.html" target="_blank">Matthew Stanley&#8217;</a>s wonderful new book introduces us to Maxwell and Huxley as they embodied theistic and naturalistic science, respectively, in Victorian Britain. Moving well beyond the widespread assumption that modern science and religion are and always have been fundamentally antithetical to one another, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022616487X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Huxley&#8217;s Church &amp; Maxwell&#8217;s Demon: From Theistic Science to Naturalistic Science </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) offers a history of scientific naturalism that illustrates the deep and fundamental commonalities between positions on the proper practice of science that began to diverge relatively late and in very particular historical circumstances. Beginning at a point when Maxwell&#8217;s theistic science was the &#8220;standard&#8221; and Huxley was the &#8220;challenger,&#8221; and ending at the point when Huxley &#8220;won,&#8221; Stanley goes on to guide readers through some of the major topics of debate that characterized Victorian science (including the nature of miracles and of consciousness, the limits of science, the origin of the universe, the question of intellectual freedom, the morality of education, the possibility of free will) to show the gradual divergence of perspectives that were always rooted in concerns about scientific practice, and to consider the ramifications of this history for how we understand and conduct debates over Intelligent Design and related issues today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Based on a documentary archive that includes oral history interviews and corporate documents resulting from patent litigation, Rasmussen&#8217;s book emphasizes the agency of the biologists in in driving the development of first-generation recombinant DNA drugs like insulin, human growth hormone, and interferon. After an introduction to the development of basic molecular biology in a Cold War context &#8211; and paying special attention to the ways that Kuhn&#8217;s notion of &#8220;normal science&#8221; helped shape the discipline &#8211; the ensuing chapters each present a case study that illustrates an important aspect of the history of biotech&#8217;s rise as manifest in laboratories, courtrooms, universities, freezers, markets, and the public arena.

Museums of Science &amp; Natural History in the Twentieth Century </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) guides readers through a transformation in American science and nature museums as museums moved from a nineteenth-century focus on research and specimen collections to a twentieth-century emphasis on public engagement and display. Written collaboratively over nearly a decade, Life on Display simultaneously develops an argument for a &#8220;renegotiation of the relationship between display, research, and education in American museums of nature and science,&#8221; and opens up an archive of fascinating (and at times hilarious and moving) stories of members of the museum-going public (some of who gifted dog fleas and dead pets to their local museums), non-human inhabitants of interactive museum displays (including an owl with a penchant for riding in cars and &#8220;trim, up-on-their-toes cockroaches&#8221;), and museum professionals who painted, debated, made dioramas, invented &#8220;Exploratoria,&#8221; and occasionally wrote limericks. This is a book for anyone interested in American history, museum studies, visual culture, science studies, the history of education, grasshopper surgery, or Jurassic Park (among many, many other fields it contributes to). It&#8217;s a wonderfully engaging history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Hidden algorithms make many of the decisions that affect significant areas of society: the economy, personal and organizational reputation, the promotion of information, etc. These complex formulas, or processes, are thought by many to be unbiased and impartial and, therefore, good for automated decision-making. Yet, recent scandals, as well as information uncovered by researchers and investigative reporters have uncovered that these algorithms may not be as neutral as believed. At the same time, there is no mechanism, legal or otherwise, that would force organizations to make these hidden processes transparent for evaluation.<br />
In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674368274/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information</a> (Harvard University Press, 2015), <a href="https://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=984" target="_blank">Frank Pasquale</a>, a professor of law at the University of Maryland, and affiliate fellow at <a href="http://isp.yale.edu/">Yale Law School&#8217;s Information Society Project</a>, explores the significant influence that hidden processes have on finance, search, and reputation. Pasquale examines the increasing corporate, and government, surveillance of consumers, and the incongruity between the secrecy allowed to corporations in comparison to that allowed to regular citizens. In so doing, he calls for greater oversight, transparency, and enforcement to help restore organizational trust and to combat the possible deleterious effects that technical secrecy may have.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Words have meaning. More specifically, the definitions attached to words shape our perspective on, and how we categorize, the things that we encounter. The words of &#8220;technology&#8221; and &#8220;innovation&#8221; are exemplars of how definitions impact perspectives. Ask most people what they think of when they hear these words, and most often they will respond pictures of computers, the Internet, and mobile systems. But these pictures fail to encapsulate the true meanings of technology and innovation because they are narrow, and reflect bias toward the idea of the digital or information society.<br />
What&#8217;s needed is a broad view of technology and innovation that encompasses a wide variety of the ways that different communities solve problems. In Transient Workspaces: Technologies of Everyday Innovation in Zimbabwe (MIT 2014), <a href="http://web.mit.edu/sts/people/mavhunga.html" target="_blank">Clapperton Chakanetsa Mavhunga</a>, an associate professor of Science, Technology, and Society at MIT, asserts that technological innovations are ways in which regular people solve the problems that they face in everyday life. Focusing on communities in Zimbabwe, Mavhunga demonstrates how innovation happens not only in laboratories or studios, but also in the spaces where individuals encounter obstacles.<br />
To do so, Mavhunga details how creativity can be found in the mobilities of African people. In addition, he makes evident the folly in ignoring and sometimes criminalizing traditional knowledge when that technology has, time and again, proven indispensable.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.johannadrucker.com/" target="_blank">Johanna Drucker</a>&#8216;s marvelous new book gives us a language with which to talk about visual epistemology.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674724933/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production </a>(Harvard University Press, 2014) simultaneously introduces the nature and function of information graphics, awakens readers to the visual interfaces prevalent in our daily work, and considers how paying careful attention to visual interpretation can serve a broader humanistic agenda. Drucker urges us to think of graphic forms of knowledge not as mere presentation, but as interpretation, as &#8220;arguments made in graphical form.&#8221; Here, images are not necessarily fixed displays of information:Drucker suggests a way to think about images as producers of knowledge. Once we understand and approach a graphic display as a generative technology, it opens up some fascinating ways of imagining the future of the book, of reading, and of composition. As a thoughtfully and beautifully produced volume, Graphesisalso challenges our visual and material expectations for a book-as-object in its form as well as its argument. This will be a fascinating and compelling read for anyone working in/on/with visual forms of knowledge production in the humanities (digital and otherwise) or the history of the book. It is an excellent and productive book to think with, to create with, and to teach with.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/history/faculty/daniel-margocsy" target="_blank">Daniel Margocsy</a>&#8216;s beautiful new book opens with a trip to Amsterdam by Baron Zacharias Conrad von Uffenbach, and closes with a shopping spree by Peter the Great. These two trips bookend a series of fascinating forays into the changing world of entrepreneurial science in the early modern Netherlands. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022611774X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Commercial Visions: Science, Trade, and Visual Culture in the Dutch Golden Age </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) considers scientific knowledge as a commodity, looking carefully at how the growth of global trade in the Dutch Golden Age shaped anatomy and natural history as commercial practices. Margocsy argues that commercialization stimulated &#8220;a debate over the epistemological status of visual facts in natural history &amp; anatomy,&#8221; transforming the concept of visual representation in the process. While learning about these debates and transformations, readers are guided on a tour through a world of seashells, forgeries, and wax-filled cadavers, evidence of a commercially-driven proliferation of ways to represent living and dead bodies and a series of heated debates about them. Commercial Visions convincingly demonstrates that paying attention to the commercial aspects of early modern science can inform how we think about early modern circulation, the history of &#8220;objectivity,&#8221; and the concept of the public sphere. Don&#8217;t miss the beautiful color plates nestled in the midst of the book!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Carolyn L. Kane&#8217;s new book traces the modern history of digital color, focusing on the role of electronic color in computer art and media aesthetics since 1960. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022600273X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Chromatic Algorithms: Synthetic Color, Computer Art, and Aesthetics after Code </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) places color at the center of media studies, exploring some amazing works of art and technology to understand the changing history of the relationship between color as embodied in machine code and screen interface. Using a methodology called &#8220;media archaeology&#8221; that is informed by the work of Foucault, Nietzsche, Kittler, Heidegger, Stiegler, and others, Chromatic Algorithms traces a transformation of color from optics to algorithms.  The chapters trace a history of synthetic color in Western aesthetics and philosophy, the rise of Day-Glo, the aesthetics of color in video art from the 1960s and 1970s, the technology of color TVs, the connection between color and notions of transcendence and utopia, &#8220;democratic color&#8221; and Salvador DalÃ­&#8217;s urinated-upon pen, the early history of art/engineering at Bell Labs, the technology of digital infrared visualization, the aesthetics of &#8220;Photoshop cinema,&#8221; bioart and its glow-in-the-dark bunnies, and the work of some amazing artists including Lillian Schwartz, Jeremy Blake, and many many others. It is a gorgeous and fascinating study of color, technology, visualization, the digital, and beyond.<br />
As you work through the book, I highly recommend searching the Web for some of the amazing work described in its chapters. I&#8217;m based in Canada and so some of the following links may not work for you: in that case, just try searching on your own for the title:<br />

Shim</a>&#8216;s new book juxtaposes the accounts of epidemiologists and lay people to consider the roles of race, class, and gender (among other things) in health and illness. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814786855/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Heart-Sick: The Politics of Risk, Inequality, and Heart Disease </a>(New York University Press, 2014) integrates several kinds of sources into a theoretically-informed sociological investigation of inequality and cardiovascular disease, including interviews with epidemiologists and people of color who are dealing in different ways with the disease, participant observation at conferences and health education events, and engagement with discourses of cultural and social theory. Shim considers the points of commonality and divergence among lay and epidemiological communities in terms of how each group conceptualizes the nature of social and cultural difference, the significance of difference for health and disease, and the reliability of different forms of knowledge. In the process, Heart-Sick places these accounts into dialogue with theories of biopower and biopolitics, intersectionality (a notion that addresses how &#8220;interlocking systems of oppression shape both the distribution of chances and of risk&#8221;), and fundamental causality (a concept that considers social conditions as fundamental causes of disease). The result is a masterfully articulated and clearly argued study that will be of interest to sociologists of science and medicine, historians, and curious readers interested in becoming better informed about the processes through which we have come to understand our bodies and selves and the consequences of those processes for research and treatment of heart disease.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;In a sense, all life consists of the colonization of an electric world. But to see that, we have to go back to the very beginning.&#8221;<a href="http://history.uwo.ca/People/Faculty/turkel.html" target="_blank"> William J. Turkel</a>&#8216;s new book traces the emergence and inhabiting of an electric world through the span of human history and beyond. Embracing a &#8220;big history&#8221; approach to the archive, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/142140981X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Spark from the Deep: How Shocking Experiments with Strongly Electric Fish Powered Scientific Discovery </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013) is a story of the human understanding and use of electricity through the study of strongly-electric catfish, rays, and eels. It&#8217;s a history of intimacy between life and the electric, humans and instruments, life and death, from the earliest history of human interaction with strongly electric fish through the modern world. Turkel collects a fascinating set of sources and stories on therapeutic, experimental, and conceptual encounters with fish as apparatus, and readers will find wonderful engagements with the work of Darwin, Volta, Galvani, von Humboldt, Faraday, Du Bois-Reymond, and many more writers and thinkers. Spark from the Deep is also the result of a very inventive and thoughtful approach to digital history, and we talk about Turkel&#8217;s research methodology and engagement with digital tools and sources in the course of the interview. As a result, this will be of interest to listeners who seek stories of the electric, as well as listeners interested more broadly in the craft of history. Enjoy!<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Failure by government agencies to share information has had disastrous results globally. From the inability to prevent terrorist attacks, like the 9-11 attacks in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania, to the ill-equipped and ill-fated responses to disasters like the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, and Hurricane Katrina, a common denominator in all of these events, and those similar, was a lack of inter- and intra-government information sharing. In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262027879/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traversing Digital Babel: Information, E-Government, and Exchange</a> (MIT 2014), <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/dataj/controller/ihoker/MOP-STAFF_LINK?sno=5316463&amp;Save_t=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alon Peled</a>, associate professor of political science at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, conceptualizes a platform that would incentivize inter-agency information sharing. Called the Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE), the platform would not only enable the trading of information, but also offers the valuation of information assets. In this way the PSIE creates an inter-government economic system. In detailing of the opportunities and threats to such a system, Peled offers examples of how similar systems have been implemented in governments throughout the world, and uses interdisciplinary training and experience in information technology and political science to describe a system and rationale that could offer assistance to those looking for simplified and efficient government.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the early days of the Internet, optimists saw the future as highly connected, where voices from across the globe would mingle and learn from one another as never before. However, as <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ethan Zuckerman</a> argues in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393082830/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection</a> (Norton, 2013), just because a connection is possible does not mean disparate voices are being heard. Instead, things and not ideas have become more connected; we now live in a world where is easier to get a bottle of water from a tropical island halfway around the world than it is to get (let alone comprehend) news from that island.<br />
Zuckerman, a media scholar and activist based at MIT, suggests despite our perceived &#8220;connectedness,&#8221; the wired world is actually becoming more provincial and narrow, as we shift from professionally curated news and information, to search engines and algorithmically selected information based on previous &#8220;likes&#8221; and those of our homogeneous social circles. In other words, we are getting more and more of what we already know we want with ever-greater efficiency, but not what we need to be informed participants in a global world.<br />
In an expansive analysis that takes on everything from the global response to modern pandemics, to Greek philosophy, to the &#8220;Arab Spring,&#8221; to musical hybridization across cultures, Zuckerman calls for a world of &#8220;digital cosmopolitans,&#8221; where those who can bridge between communities are called upon to foster deeper, more nuanced conversations around the globe in ways that fulfill the promise of expanding technological opportunities.<br />
At once a thoughtful analysis, an engaging history, and a bold call to arms, Rewire offers readers a deep understanding of how media is evolving to shape and be shaped by global voices. As such, it has vast implications at both personal and geopolitical levels for the future of information, technology.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.english.northwestern.edu/people/emeritus/lipkingl.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence Lipking</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080145297X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">What Galileo Saw: Imagining the Scientific Revolution </a>(Cornell University Press, 2014) examines the role of imagination and creativity in the seventeenth century developments that have come to be known as the Scientific Revolution. Whereas some accounts suggest that this period involved the rejection of imaginative thinking, Lipking traces it through the works of Galileo, Kepler, Bacon, Newton, Hooke, and many others, demonstrating that the ability to envision new worlds is as crucial to their critical insights as rational thought.Each chapter of the book approaches a different discipline, from astronomy to natural history and the life sciences, exploring the intersection between imagination and the emerging ideas surrounding the scientific process.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[After the Second World War, the Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs described National Socialism as a triumph of irrationalism and a &#8220;destruction of reason.&#8221; It has since become commonplace to interpret modern European intellectual history as a prolonged struggle between the Enlightenment and Romanticism. The Enlightenment is generally valorized as identical with rationality, mechanism, cosmopolitanism, liberalism, progress, optimism, and secularism, while Romanticism is often connected to holism, irrationality, conservatism, nationalism, myth, pessimism and, eventually, fascism.<br />
<a href="https://hss.sas.upenn.edu/people/tresch" target="_blank">John Tresch</a> (University of Pennsylvania) questions these dichotomies in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022621480X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Romantic Machine: Utopian Science and Technology after Napoleon</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012). In our interview we discuss what made steam engines Romantic, which technical illusions awaited early nineteenth-century Parisian theatergoers and how Saint-Simonians could envisage future society as a Romantic machine.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How did we come to think of spaces for the storage and circulation of body parts as &#8220;banks,&#8221; and what are the consequences of that history for the way we think about human bodies as property today? <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/faculty/directory/swanson.html" target="_blank">Kara W. Swanson</a>&#8216;s wonderful new book traces the history of body banks in America from the nineteenth century to today, focusing especially on milk, blood, and sperm. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674281438/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Banking on the Body: The Market in Blood, Milk, and Sperm in Modern America </a>(Harvard University Press, 2014) takes readers into early twentieth-century America, when doctors first turned to human bodies and their parts as sources of material to help cure their most desperate cases. As these doctors developed an expertise in harvesting body products and sought reliable and cooperative supplies thereof, human milk and blood were first transformed into commodities. Swanson&#8217;s story introduces some of the most crucial actors in this history, including wet nurses, professional blood donors, Red Cross volunteer &#8220;Grey Ladies,&#8221; doctors, blood bank managers, mothers who ran milk banks, sperm donors, and many, many others. The story is deeply satisfying on many levels: as a window into particular human lives, as a conceptual history with material consequences, and as a set of case studies that illuminates and informs today&#8217;s legal and medical landscapes. This is a book that should be on the shelves and in the hands of anyone interested in legal history, medical history, modern notions of &#8220;property,&#8221; and the ways that the past had shaped what happens to our bodies in the present and what might happen to them in the future.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There is no doubt that innovations in technology have had, and are having, a significant impact on society, changing the way we live, work, and play. But the changes that we are seeing are far from novel. In fact, most are a continuation of changes to society and societal structure with roots in the past. So argues  <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/academics/?facid=hc401">Hugh F. Cline</a>, adjunct professor of sociology and education at  <a href="http://www.tc.columbia.edu/">Teachers College</a>,  <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, in his new book,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138016802/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Information Communication Technology and Social Transformation: A Social and Historical Perspective</a> (Routledge, 2014). According to Cline, the technopanics, or strong objections to new technology have happened since the days of Aristotle. In spite of the objections, technological innovations can positively advance societal interests. Mixing history, sociology, anthropology, and technological studies, Cline provides context for the examination of how ICTs are impacting society.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://dappan.net/uva/" target="_blank">Robert Stolz</a>&#8216;s new book explores the emergence of an environmental turn in modern Japan. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822356996/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Bad Water: Nature, Pollution; Politics in Japan, 1870-1950</a> (Duke University Press, 2014) guides readers through the unfolding of successive eco-historical periods in Japan. Stolz charts the transformations of an &#8220;environmental unconscious&#8221; lying at the foundation of modern social and political thought. Bad Water begins by describing the establishment of the autonomous individual as a political unit, tracing the relationship between the Meiji liberal subject and the environment beginning in the 1870s. With the emergence of toxic flows that penetrated the body, and in light of the Ashio Copper Mine incident as Japan&#8217;s first experience with industrial-scale pollution, nature and politics were increasingly difficult to keep separated. Stolz looks closely at the work of Tanaka ShÅzÅ &#8211; Japan&#8217;s famous &#8220;first conservationist&#8221; &#8211; in this context, from Tanaka&#8217;s jikiso appeal to the Meiji Emperor in 1901 through an environmental turn in which he conducted river pilgrimages and developed an ecological philosophy of &#8220;flow&#8221; (nagare) and &#8220;poison&#8221; (doku). Bad Water also considers the work of anarchist Ishikawa SanshirÅ (1876-1956) and Snow Brand Dairy founder Kurosawa TorizÅ (1885-1982), two thinkers who took up the issue of the relationship between nature, the individual, and society after Tanaka&#8217;s death in 1913. It is a fascinating and important study that will be of wide interest to scholars and readers of the histories of Japan, environmentalism, hygienic modernity, and ecology. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Our legal systems are rooted in rules and procedures concerning the burden of proof, the weighing of evidence, the reliability and admissibility of testimony, among much else. It seems obvious, then, that the law is in large part an epistemological enterprise.  And yet when one looks at the ways in which judges have wielded epistemological concepts, there is plenty of room for concern.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107698340/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Evidence Matters: Science, Proof, and Truth in the Law</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.law.miami.edu/faculty-administration/susan-haack.php?op=1">Susan Haack</a> brings her skill as an epistemologist to bear on a series of tangles concerning the legal concepts of proof, evidence, and reliability, especially as they apply in a series of notorious toxic tort cases. Along the way, she exposes several philosophical confusions in the law&#8217;s current understanding of the epistemological concepts it wields, and shows how her own distinctive epistemology&#8211;Foundherentism&#8211;can be useful to the law.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022611452X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Emergence of Tropical Medicine in France </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014), <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/cla/shpr/michael-osborne" target="_blank">Michael Osborne</a> offers a new way to think about and practice the history of colonial medicine. Eschewing pan-European or Anglo-centric models of the history of colonial medicine, Osborne&#8217;s book focuses on the centrality, transformations, and ultimate demise of naval medicine in France in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Motivating the central arguments and narrative of the book is a concern with place, places, and emplacement, and Osborne explores maritime medical practices and the ecology of disease in French provincial port cities, on ships, in prisons, in hospitals and schools, and beyond. The Emergence of Tropical Medicine in France pays special attention to how the study and conception of race, and its connection with health and disease, was formed and reformed in these settings. Readers with a special interest in the relationship between medicine and the military will find much to enjoy here, as will those who come to the book wanting to know more about the maritime history of diseases like Yellow Fever, lead poisoning, and Malaria. There&#8217;s also some wonderful storytelling here, including a fascinating account of a book-bomber in Chapter 4. It is a beautifully written account, and it should be required reading for those interested in the history of medicine and healing, of France, of the colonial medical past, and of place and locality.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://hss.sas.upenn.edu/people/tresch" target="_blank">John Tresch</a>&#8216;s beautiful new book charts a series of transformations that collectively ushered in a new cosmology in the Paris of the early-mid nineteenth century. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226812200/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Romantic Machine: Utopian Science and Technology after Napoleon</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012) narrates the emergence of a new image of the machine, a new concept of nature, a new theory of knowledge, and a new political orientation through a series of chapters that each use the work of a single figure to open up a world of romantic machines.<br />
Part 1 of the book looks at the work of physical scientists whose model of precision experiment and math was transformed by an encounter with romantic philosophy and aesthetics, and introduces the electro-magnetic work of physicist AndreMarie Ampre, the instrumental practices of Prussian geophysical researcher Alexander von Humboldt, and the labor theory of knowledge in relation to the instruments of astronomer and politician Francois Arago. Part 2 looks at the impact of technology on theories of the self and the human, focusing on the fantastic arts and public spectacles featuring new discoveries in optics, mechanics, and natural history. (Readers will find lively discussions of dioramas, hallucinatory opera, symphonies, museums, magic shows, and expositions, here.) Part 3 treats the utopian thinkers and engineer-scientists of the late Restoration and the July Monarchy, looking at religiously-inflected social technologies of conversion, communication, and temporal coordination in the work and thought of Saint-Simon and his followers, printer and literary critic Pierre Leroux&#8217;s work and theories, and Auguste Comte&#8217;s instruments of thought and paper. It is a rich, elegantly argued work that offers not just a history of science and technology, but also a tracing of the roots of some contemporary continental philosophy, as well.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Right now, humanists across very different disciplinary fields are trying to create the kinds of cross-disciplinary conversations that might open up new ways to conceptualize and ask questions of our objects of study. <a href="http://uiswcmsweb.prod.lsu.edu/hss/prs/People/Philosophy%20Faculty/item42719.html" target="_blank">John Protevi</a>&#8216;s new book offers a wonderfully stimulating conceptual toolbox for doing just that. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816681023/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Life, War, Earth: Deleuze and the Sciences </a>(University of Minnesota Press, 2013) creates (and guides readers through) a dialogue between the work of Gilles Deleuze and some key works and concepts animating contemporary geophilosophy, cognitive science, and biology. In doing so, Protevi&#8217;s work also has the potential to inform work in STS by turning our attention to new possibilities of thinking with scale, and with a process-oriented philosophy (among many other things). A first introduction lays out some of the basic conceptual tools and orientations emerging from Deleuze&#8217;s work, and a second introduction uses some of these ideas to explore the work of Francisco Varela in terms of a political physiology of &#8220;bodies politic.&#8221; After this pair of introductions, the following chapters focus on particular case studies, ranging from ancient and modern warfare, to hydropolitics, to the notion of a &#8220;socially mediated neuroplasticity&#8221; in cognitive science, to the role of affect in understanding the Occupy Wall Street movement, to the &#8220;eco-devo-evo&#8221; of Mary Jane West-Eberhard, and much, much else. It&#8217;s a fascinating study that has much to offer for the reader who is interested in the creative and analytic possibilities of bringing continental philosophy to bear in science studies.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.queensu.ca/classics/daryn-lehoux" target="_blank">Daryn Lehoux</a>&#8216;s new book will forever change the way you think about garlic and magnets.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226471144/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">What Did the Romans Know?: An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012) is a fascinating account of the co-production of facts and worlds, taking readers into the sciences of Rome from the first century BC to the second century AD. Masterfully blending approaches from the history and philosophy of science, Lehoux traces the significance of the &#8220;threefold cord&#8221; of nature, law, and the gods in making up the early Roman world. The chapters use the works of Cicero, Seneca, Galen, Ptolemy, and others to explore topics making up the foundation of a history of Roman science, including the importance of divination to Roman politics and natural knowledge, the relationship between optics and ethics in the Roman world, and the entanglements of law, nature, and witnessing.  What Did the Romans Know?  also contributes to philosophical debates over the theory-ladenness of observation, scientific and historical realism, and relativism. Lehoux ends his account as an &#8220;epistemological coherentist,&#8221; suggesting a model for thinking about and with the sciences in history and beyond. On top of all of this, the language of the text sparkles. It&#8217;s a wonderfully enjoyable read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In two recent books, <a href="http://history.psu.edu/directory/gjs4" target="_blank">Gregory Smits</a> offers a history of earthquakes and seismology in Japan that creates a wonderful dialogue between history and the sciences. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0824838173/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Seismic Japan: The Long History and Continuing Legacy of the Ansei Edo Earthquake</a> (University of Hawai&#8217;i Press, 2013) is a deeply contextualized study of the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake and its reverberations into the twenty-first century, arguing that the quake not only played an important role in shaping ideas about politics, religion, geography, and the sciences in Japan, but also generated new ways of thinking about human agency and earthquakes that continue to be influential today. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442220090/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">When the Earth Roars: Lessons from the History of Earthquakes in Japan</a> (Rowman and Littlefield, 2014) is a synthetic account of earthquakes along the Sanriku coast of Japan from early modernity to now, offering a deep contextualization of the 3/11 disaster and some important lessons for how we might cope with the possibilities of further seismic activity (in Japan and beyond) in the future. Both books build on Smits&#8217; expertise in the documents of Japanese history to inform and create a history of science that speaks beautifully to contemporary issues of profound global importance.

These episodes collectively move readers away from understanding Darwin and his histories in terms of &#8220;isms,&#8221; instead looking carefully at the roles of three interrelated factors in shaping public encounters with Darwin&#8217;s ideas: place, politics, and rhetoric. The book concludes with a look at the ways that these factors continue to be pervasive in more recent dealings with Darwin. With its vibrant language, careful research, and compelling argument, Dealing with Darwin will be a must-read for historians of science, especially those interested in evolution, religion, Darwin, and/or locality.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://politicalscience.jhu.edu/bios/william-connolly/" target="_blank">Bill Connolly</a>&#8216;s  new book proposes a way to think about the world as a gathering of self-organizing systems or ecologies, and from there explores the ramifications and possibilities of this notion for how we think about and practice work with markets, politics, daily life, and beyond.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822355841/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Fragility of Things: Self-Organizing Processes, Neoliberal Fantasies, and Democratic Activism</a> (Duke UP, 2013)  opens with a prelude that takes readers into the 1755 earthquake disaster in Lisbon via Voltaire&#8217;s Candide, using this to introduce a critique of neoliberalism that will continue to be so important for the duration of the book. Connolly reframes our understanding of markets in terms of an entanglement of human and nonhuman systems, with main chapters successively offering a critique of current thinking about neoliberalism and clear suggestions for how to move forward from it, a close reading of the work of Friedrich Hayek, and wonderfully productive dialogues between Kant and Hesiod (in Ch. 3) and Nietzsche and Whitehead (in Ch. 4). A series of interludes open up the narrative and ideas from the main chapters in light of contemporary film, bridges and thermodynamic systems, and the idea of human &#8220;fullness&#8221; and vitality. A postlude explores the relations between belief, sensibility, role experimentation, and political activism. In short,  The Fragility of Things  is an inspiring and beautifully written work. For readers interested in STS in particular, it also offers a way to think with self-organizing systems in the service of reorienting our stories about (human and nonhuman) individuals, their relationships, and the larger networks of which they&#8217;re a part. Highly recommended!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Host Jonathan Judaken and author Alice Conklin discuss the thorny relationship between science, society, and empire at the high water mark of French imperialism and European fascism, as well as this neglected chapter in the international history of the human sciences.  In Memphis, and in America generally, we remain haunted by the history of &#8220;race&#8221; as a concept, and racism as a set of social practices. To gain some perspective on our local history, it is useful to take a step back, both in time and place.  <a href="http://history.osu.edu/directory/conklin44" target="_blank">Alice Conklin</a>&#8216;s newest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0801478782/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">In the Museum of Man: Race, Anthropology, and Empire in France, 1850-1950 </a>(Cornell University Press, 2013), tells the story of how the discipline of anthropology and Paris&#8217; ethnographic museum par excellence, the Museum of Man, are wound into the history of racial science and colonial conquest, but also ultimately played an important part in undoing scientific racism.  The book offers new insight into the thorny relationship between science, society, and empire at the high water mark of French imperialism and European fascism, as well as recovers a neglected chapter in the international history of the human sciences.  Alice Conklin is a professor in the Department of History at Ohio State University. Her first book, A Mission to Civilize: The Republican Idea of Empire in France and West Africa, 1895-1930 (Stanford, 1997) examined the ways in which France&#8217;s liberal Third Republic produced a consensus on the legitimacy of imperialism through the notion of a special &#8220;mission to civilize&#8221; &#8211; highlighting the racist and republican elements that together influenced French policy-making. The book won the 1998 Book Prize of the Berskshire Conference of Women&#8217;s Historians.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In the course of making life-and-death decisions, the subjects of Gammeltoft&#8217;s book confronted ethically demanding circumstances through which they forged moral selves. Inspired by the work of Emmanuel Levinas, Haunting Images considers their reproductive choices as acts of collective belonging, producing the subjectivities of both mother and fetus. The book considers these choices in light of the extended repercussions of Agent Orange in Vietnam, the local specificity of biopower, national concepts of &#8220;population quality,&#8221; and the precarity of individual attachments to social collectives. The second half of the book follows the experiences of women who were informed via 3D ultrasound scans that the children they expected would be anomalous, tracing their choices, questions, contexts, and encounters with childhood disability.  It is a powerful and deeply affecting study<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.oakland.edu/?id=25322&amp;sid=288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Craig Martin</a>&#8216;s new book carefully traces religious arguments for and against Aristotelianism from the eleventh through the eighteenth centuries. Based on a close reading of a staggering array of primary sources, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421413167/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subverting Aristotle: Religion, History, and Philosophy in Early Modern Science </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014) in turn subverts several assumptions about the connection between Aristotelian thought and the emergence of the new sciences in early modernity. The book argues that we ought to understand the seventeenth century decline of Aristotle and Aristotelians as an authority in natural philosophy in its relation to the contemporaneous religious readings of Aristotelian texts. In a series of chapters that each look carefully at a particular temporal and philosophical context of debate over the readings of Aristotle, Averroes, and their interlocutors by various religious communities, Martin&#8217;s book offers a compelling and deeply textured account of arguments over the piety, language, translation, and other aspects of the Aristotelian corpus. This is a book that beautifully shows the interrelationships of the histories of science and religion, while taking readings on a journey through the philosophical corpora of some of the most foundational thinkers on the nature of the cosmos and the soul; through transformations in the craft of historical analysis; and through an important period when translation (and debates about it) helped shape the intellectual histories of the medieval and early modern worlds. It is a fascinating book, and an especially important study for anyone interested in the history of early modern science and/or the relationships between the early histories of science and religion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In this way, Prasad deconstructs West/non-West technological and cultural divisions, as well as elucidating Euro/West-centrism in the histories of technology. To do so, Prasad examines five key aspects of MRI research: invention, industrial development, market, history, and culture. In so doing, Prasad provides a critique of the situating of the origin of modern science in the West.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;One doesn&#8217;t so much  read a death certificate, it would seem, as perform calisthenics on one&#8230;&#8221;<br />
From the first, prefatory page of <a href="http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/faculty_bios/view/Lisa_Gitelman" target="_blank">Lisa Gitelman</a>&#8216;s new book, the reader is introduced to a way of thinking about documents as tools for creating bodily experience, and as material objects situated within hierarchies and relationships of labor. Working beautifully at the intersection of media studies and history,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822356570/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Paper Knowledge: Toward a Media History of Documents</a> (Duke University Press, 2014) curates a thoughtful and inspiring collection of moments from the expansion of a modern &#8220;scriptural economy.&#8221; The case studies explore fill-in-the-blank forms in the context of late nineteenth century job printing, typescript books and scholarly communication in the 1930s, photocopies and photocopying in the 1960s and 1970s, and PDF files in the 1990s and beyond. The final chapter is a fascinating exploration of what it might look like to write a situated history of amateurdom and the figure of the &#8220;amateur,&#8221; a theme that recurs throughout the preceding chapters. Though all of these cases are carefully rooted within a US context, the insights gleaned from them potentially apply to a much wider and trans-local conversation about the documentary media of writers and readers. It is a history of documenting as an epistemic practice and documents as instruments, and that history is consistently and productively entangled with concerns about reproduction, access, labor, and the emergence of a bureaucratic self. Along the way,  Paper Knowledge  helpfully opens up some persistent historiographical notions that benefit from such opening, such as &#8220;print culture,&#8221; &#8220;digital humanities,&#8221; &#8220;authorship,&#8221; and other categories that have defined the history of and with communication, and that animate contemporary debates within academia and beyond.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty/faculty-1/faculty-1?lid=220" target="_blank">Mary Terrall</a>&#8216;s new book is a beautifully-written, carefully-researched, and compellingly-argued account of the practices of natural history in the eighteenth-century francophone world. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022608860X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Catching Nature in the Act: Reaumur and the Practice of Natural History in the Eighteenth Century</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2014) explores this world via the work of  Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur and his vast and varied networks of correspondents, assistants, colleagues, and co-naturalists. As we read, we follow this loose network across the bakeries, gardens, tidepools, hedges, studies, academies, kitchens, poultry yards, specimen collections, and other spaces of quotidian life and their associated practices of natural history. As these men and women observed, chased, collected, dissected, preserved, painted, described, and tested, they practiced the production of knowledge about the natural world as a part of their intimate, daily lives. The chapters of Terrall&#8217;s book observe them as they in turn observe aphids, mayflies, sea anemones, chickens, and other creatures as a means to understand larger questions about the nature of generation, metamorphosis, reproduction, and other lived behaviors and processes. They feed material from inside the quills of young pigeon feathers to spiders in order to study spider silk and its commercial potential. They glue glass to cocoons to create windows into the metamorphoses of the butterflies inside. They use hog bristles to turn tiny polyps inside-out and observe how they responded. They draw, they incubate, and they incorporate practices and materials from the physical sciences to do so. Catching Nature in the Act contributes thoughtfully to several interrelated historiographical threads in the history of science &#8211; the histories of practice and place, the importance of the household as a space of observation and experiment, the role of networks of correspondence and collaboration, the relationship between natural science and theology &#8211; and offers helpful revisions of dominant approaches to each of those historiographies of science and its histories. It is a must-read for historians of science, and a fascinating narrative for any interested reader.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;It is a commonplace of social criticism that America has become, over the past half century or so, a nation of narcissists.&#8221;<br />
From this opening, <a href="http://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/elizabeth-lunbeck" target="_blank">Elizabeth Lunbeck</a>&#8216;s new book proceeds to offer a fascinating narrative of how this came to be, exploring the entwined histories of narcissism, psychoanalysis, and modernity in 20th and 21st century America. Narcissism permeated 1970s discourse on America, its decline, the relationship of that decline to material consumption, and the physical and emotional pathologies associated with these transformations. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674724860/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Americanization of Narcissism </a>(Harvard University Press, 2014) takes readers into the deeper history of the emergence, complexities, and metamorphoses of the study of narcissism in the work of psychoanalysts Heinz Kohut and Otto Kernberg in the early 20th century, at the same time offering a wonderfully rich account situating them in the larger context of interlocutors that included Freud, Joan Riviere, and others. The book concludes with a thoughtful reflection on the recent resurgence of the idea of &#8220;healthy narcissism,&#8221; its relationship to the notion of charismatic leaders (like Steve Jobs), and the place of &#8220;Generation Me&#8221; in all of this. Lunbeck&#8217;s book should be required reading for anyone working in the history of the human sciences, of psychoanalysis, and of the modern US. It&#8217;s also an enlightening and very readable story that helpfully and productively problematizes a commonplace (narcissism = bad = American) that permeates contemporary popular culture, from TV shows to online personality quizzes. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Why do we study the history of science?<br />
Historians of science don&#8217;t just teach us about the past: along with philosophers of science, they also help us to understand the foundations and assumptions of scientific research, and guide us to reliable sources of information on which to base our policies and opinions. <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/people/jane-maienschein" target="_blank">Jane Maienschein</a>&#8216;s new book is a model of the kind of careful, balanced, and beautifully written history of science that makes a significant contribution not just to the historiography of science, but also to the public understanding of science and its lived consequences. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674725557/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Embryos Under the Microscope: The Diverging Meanings of Life </a>(Harvard University Press, 2014) traces the historical transformations in the observation and observability of the earliest stages of developing life. Maienschein&#8217;s account is a focused and thoughtfully organized book that gradually reveals aspects of the history of early stages of life, carefully curating the elements of her narrative such that they collectively inform broader debates over embryo-related policy in the contemporary United States. Readers follow animal and human embryos in their metamorphoses from hypothetical to observed entities, seeing them sequentially transform into experimental, computational, and engineered objects. The final chapter considers the implications of the story in light of recent debates on topics such as fetal pain, paying special attention to the distinction between making policy decisions based on metaphysics vs. science. Embryos Under the Microscope is equally well-suited to academic historians of science wanting a clear introduction to the history of developmental biology, general readers seeking an introduction to a crucial topic of social and political debate, and teachers interested in assigning one or more of the chapters in relevant undergraduate courses. Enjoy!<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Inherently problematic in most mainstream discussions of the impact of technology is the dominant western or global northern perspective. In this way, the impact of technology on societies in developing countries, the impact of these societies on technology, and how those technologies are used is often ignored or marginalized.

Nasim&#8217;s approach blends the history and philosophy of science in a study that informs the histories of astronomy, images, and paperwork, and that emphasizes the importance of the philosophy of mind and its history in shaping this heavenly narrative. His transdisciplinary approach spans several media that include maps and portraits, oil paintings and etchings, private drawings and collectively-produced published images. The book helped me see Van Gogh&#8217;s The Starry Night, and the starry night above, with new eyes and a new appreciation for the vision and visioning of nineteenth century astronomical observers.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The &#8220;cloud&#8221; and &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; have been buzzwords over the past few years, with businesses and even governments praising the ability to save information remotely and access that information from anywhere. And an increasing number of organizations and individuals are using the cloud almost exclusively for their computing and storage purposes. The question remains, however, whether there is an actual understanding of what the cloud is, and the issues and implications that surround the growth in cloud storage and computing. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/To-Cloud-Data-Turbulent-World/dp/1612056164">To the Cloud: Big Data in a Turbulent World</a>, <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/sociology/people/emeritusfaculty/mosco.html">Vincent Mosco</a>, a Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Queen&#8217;s University, where he was the Canada Research Chair in Communication and Society, describes the political, social, and cultural issues surrounding cloud computing. According to Mosco, &#8220;cloud computing serves as a prism that reflects and refracts every major issue in the field of information technology and society.&#8221; In To The Cloud, Mosco examines this prism and considers the historic, present day, and future implications of cloud computing.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The work of Charles Darwin, together with the writing of associated scholars of society and its organs and organisms, had a particularly global reach in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/Elshakry.html">Marwa Elshakry</a>&#8216;s new book offers a fascinating window into the ways that this work was read and rendered in modern Arabic-language contexts. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022600130X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860-1950 </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013) invites us into a late nineteenth-century moment when the notions of &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;civilization&#8221; mutually transformed one another, and offers a thoughtful and nuanced account of the ways that this played out for scholars working and writing in Syria and Egypt. The early chapters of Elshakry&#8217;s book focus on the central role played by popular science journals like Al-Muqtataf (The Digest) in translating and disseminating Darwin&#8217;s ideas. We meet Ya&#8217;qub Sarruf and Faris Nimr, young teachers at the Syrian Protestant College who were instrumental in translating scientific works into Arabic there and, later, in Egypt. An entire chapter looks closely at Isma&#8217;il Mazhar&#8217;s work producing the first verbatim translation of Darwin&#8217;s Origin of Species into Arabic, but the book also looks well beyond Darwin to consider broader Arabic discourses on the relationship between science and society, as those discourses were shaped by engagements with the work of Herbert Spencer, and many others. Elshakry pays special attention to the ways that this story is embedded in the histories of print culture, the politics of empire, and debates over educational reform, materialism, and socialism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and concludes with a consideration of the continuing reverberations of these issues into late twentieth century Egypt and beyond. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the entanglements of science, translation, and empire in the modern world, and it will change the way we understand the place of Arabic interlocutors in the history of modern science.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/034553803X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Birdmen: The Wright Brothers, Glenn Curtiss, and the Battle to Control the Skies</a> (Ballentine Books, 2014), <a href="http://www.lawrencegoldstone.com/" target="_blank">Lawrence Goldstone</a> recounts the discovery and mastery of aviation at the turn of the twentieth century&#8211;and all the litigation that ensued. Foremost amongst the legal battles in early aviation was the suits waged between the Wilbur and Orville Wright and Glenn Curtiss. Goldstone offers an in depth view of that struggle.<br />
From the publisher: &#8220;While the Wright brothers&#8217; contributions to aviation are so famous as to be legendary, the ruthlessness with which they stifled their competitors remains largely unknown. The feud between the Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss was a collision of strong, unyielding, profoundly American personalities. On one side was a pair of tenacious siblings who together had solved the centuries-old riddle of powered, heavier-than-air flight. On the other was an audacious young motorcycle racer whose aircraft became synonymous in the public mind with death-defying stunts. For more than a decade, they battled each other in court, at air shows, and in the eyes of the scientific and business communities. At issue were more than just the profits from a patent, but control of the means of innovation in a new age of rapid industrial change. The outcome of this contest of wills would shape the course of aviation history&#8211; and take a fearsome toll on the lives and livelihoods of the men involved.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During the Great Fire of London in September 1666, Samuel Pepys went out to the garden and dug some holes. There he placed his documents, some wine, and &#8220;my parmezan cheese&#8221; for safekeeping as the buildings and streets of his city were licked and then consumed by flames. We know this thanks to a diary in which he recorded these burnings and burials. In his new book, <a href="http://www.griffith.edu.au/humanities-languages/school-humanities/staff/richard-yeo" target="_blank">Richard Yeo</a> contextualizes the diary-keeping and document-organizing practices of men like Pepys within a rich, detailed account of notes and note-taking among early modern English virtuosi. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022610656X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Notebooks, English Virtuosi, and Early Modern Science </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) offers a fascinating glimpse into practices of information management as they allowed English scholars to bridge text and memory, print media and manuscripts, journals and commonplace books, reading and observation, the individual and the collective. Yeo&#8217;s book explores the relationship between early modern methods of collecting and storing information and the larger project of Baconian natural history, paying special attention to the ways that Bacon and several Fellows of the Royal Society used notebooks and other note-keeping technologies. Beyond this, Notebooks, English Virtuosi, and Early Modern Science is also deeply embedded in the history of memory and its (dis)contents, and engages (especially in a chapter on Samuel Hartlib and his circle) the historiography of epistolary networks and early modern histories of correspondence. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://americanstudies.columbian.gwu.edu/jamie-cohen-cole" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie Cohen-Cole</a>&#8216;s new book explores the emergence of a discourse of creativity, interdisciplinarity, and the &#8220;open mind&#8221; in the context of Cold War American politics, education, and society.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022609216X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Open Mind: Cold War Politics and the Sciences of Human Nature</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2014)  considers how open-mindedness took on a political role (as a model of citizenship contrasted with that of totalitarian states), an academic role (as a model of a scientist or thinker), and a broader role as a model of human nature in the mid-late twentieth century. Cohen-Cole&#8217;s book not only offers a fascinating glimpse into the development of mid-century psychology and cognitive science, but also shows the deep connections among what was happening in what might otherwise be considered separate social and political spaces that include laboratories, classrooms, cocktail parties, conferences, academic departments, and various physical and textual loci of political and social engagement. It is exceptionally clear in its narrative structure, prose style, and argument, and it offers a fresh perspective on how we understand the co-creation of science and society in Cold War America.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://english.duke.edu/people?Gurl=&amp;Uil=1071&amp;subpage=profile" target="_blank">Robert Mitchell</a>&#8216;s new book is wonderfully situated across several intersections: of history and literature, of the Romantic and contemporary worlds, of Keats&#8217; urn and a laboratory cylinder full of dry ice. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421410885/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Experimental Life: Vitalism in Romantic Science and Literature </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013), Mitchell argues that we are in the midst of a vitalist turn in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences, and that this is only the latest in a series of eras of what he calls &#8220;experimental vitalism.&#8221; Experimental Life is largely devoted to exploring the first of those eras by tracing an experimental vitalism through a wide range of Romantic textual worlds from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. After a wonderful discussion of the meanings of the &#8220;experimental&#8221; in the arts and sciences, Mitchell&#8217;s book proceeds to look at a series of cases through which we can understand how Romantic thinkers sought out the points of perplexity in vital phenomena, encouraged that perplexity, and often did so by exploring &#8220;altered states&#8221; that seemed to confuse life and death. These altered states included suspended animation, disorientation, digestion and collapsurgence, mediality, and encounters with the uncanniness of plant life, and Mitchell&#8217;s treatment of each case is both beautifully articulated and full of unusual and illuminating juxtapositions. Ultimately, Experimental Life offers readers not just a way of understanding these Romantic contexts, but also engages each case in a way that informs how we think about contemporary biomedical sciences and biopolitics.<br />
Experimental Life has also just won the <a href="http://www.bsls.ac.uk/bsls-book-prize/">annual book prize</a> for the <a href="http://www.bsls.ac.uk/">British Society for Literature and Science</a>. Congratulations, Rob!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://soc.uic.edu/sociology/people/faculty/pbm" target="_blank">Paul-Brian McInerney</a> is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Illinois-Chicago. He is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804785120/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">From Social Movement to Moral Market: How the Circuit Riders Sparked an IT Revolution and Created a Technology Market</a> (Stanford University Press 2014).<br />
McInerney&#8217;s book tells the fascinating history of the Circuit Riders and NPower, the leading organizations in the nonprofit information technology social movement of the late 1990s. He ties together excellent elite interviews with social movement leaders with a clear institutional history of the time period. There is so much for political scientists, sociologists, and economists to learn about how social movements work.<br />
For listeners, McInerney mentions one of the presentations made to funders to support the movement. See Rob Stuart&#8217;s Circuit Rider presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GClabaugh/circuit-riders-to-the-rescue-circa-1999" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://osseo.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Abena Dove Osseo-Asare</a>&#8216;s wonderful new book is a thoughtful, provocative, and balanced account of the intersecting histories and practices of drug research in modern Ghana, South Africa, and Madagascar. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022608602X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Bitter Roots: The Search for Healing Plants in Africa </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) tells the stories of six plants, all sourced in African countries, that competing groups of plant specialists have tried to transform into pharmaceuticals since the 1880s. The leaves and roots and seeds of the book&#8217;s narrative collectively map the contours of a story that emerges from a crucial and germinal tension: on the one hand, much of the history of the plant sciences in these African spaces is motivated by a race for patents and scientific credit; at the same time, the mobility of plants across the borders of Osseo-Asare&#8217;s study has complicated efforts to assign priority of discovery to individuals or groups, and in fact challenges the very notion of a &#8220;traditional&#8221; or &#8220;indigenous&#8221; body of knowledge in the first place. Simultaneously a carefully situated ethnography and a history informed by a material archive that encompasses pages and petals, the book explores that tension in a critical assessment of what it means to talk about &#8220;African&#8221; science or &#8220;local&#8221; knowledge. Bitter Roots will deservedly have a wide audience in African studies, science studies, and the histories of medicine, pharmacy, and botany.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Kaiser</a>&#8216;s recent book is one of the most enjoyable and informative books on the history of science that you&#8217;ll read, full-stop. The deservedly award-winning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/039334231X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How the Hippies Saved Physics: Science, Counterculture, and the Quantum Revival</a> (W.W. Norton, 2012) takes readers into the &#8220;hazy, bong-filled excesses of the 1970s New Age movement&#8221; in order to explain and reveal the origins of some of the most transformative breakthroughs in twentieth-century quantum physics. Kaiser shows how the roots of quantum information science, a field that has given us the technology behind electronic bank transfers and information encryption systems, emerged from a rich soil made up of equal parts playful speculation, sophisticated calculation, and philosophical reflection, all entwined in the practices of the Fundamental Fysiks Group in the 1970s. It is a story that pays careful tribute to Einstein andThe Dancing Wu Li Masters, psychedelic mushrooms and the double-slit experiment, opera and Bell&#8217;s Theorem, quantum entanglement and Uri Geller. It is also a story of transformations in what it has looked, meant, and felt like to be a physicist since World War II. Whether you come to How the Hippies Saved Physics  primarily for the hippies or the physics, you will come away with a sense of awe both for the brilliance of these tricksters and for the deft hand that Kaiser has brought to creating a thoroughly enjoyable account of their lives, work, and legacy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In particular, Russell examines the interdisciplinary historical foundations of openness and open standards by exploring the movement toward standardization in engineering, as well as the communication industry. Paying careful attention to the politics of standardization, Russell&#8217;s book considers the ideological foundations of openness, as well as the rhetoric surrounding this ideology. Notable also is the consideration of standardization as a critique of previous ideology and a rejection of centralized control.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Hunter&#8217;s book pays close attention to the work of Robert Hooke while situating Hooke within a community of painters, architects, writers, customs brokers, telescope makers, and other fashioners of early modern experiments of all sorts. A significant contribution to both the histories of science and of art, Wicked Intelligence pays equal attention to the flat spaces of the imaged page and the built spaces of the museum, the city, and the &#8220;laboratory of the mind.&#8221; It is a beautifully written book based on a gorgeously weird archive.

In addition to a fascinating ethnography of the various kinds of work (by artists, by scientists, by patients and doctors) at IVF and stem cell research facilities, readers will find insightful explorations of the work of Marx and Engels, Haraway, Plato, Strathern, Derrida, Firestone, along with a wide range of authors of feminist texts from the 1980s and after. It is a book full of hands, socks, pipettes, eggs, screens, organisms, and arguments, it is fascinating, and it was a great pleasure to talk with Sarah about it.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[So much of Science Studies, of STS as a field or a point of engagement, is deeply concerned with objects. We create sociologies and networks of and with objects, we study them as actors or agents or actants, we worry about our relationships to them and their relationships to each other. We wonder if humans and their objects are really so different, or whether we are all octopuses shrinking behind our own ink.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816689237/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2013), <a href="http://english.rice.edu/morton.aspx" target="_blank">Timothy Morton</a> offers a way of thinking with and about hyperobjects, particular kinds of things of which we see only pieces at any given moment. (Though by the end of the book, Morton invites us to consider that perhaps every object is a hyperobject.) Hyperobjects have a number of qualities in common, and the first half of Morton&#8217;s book introduces and explores them: they stick to other beings, and they potentially transform our taken-for-granted notions of time, space, locality, causality, and the possibility of ever being &#8220;away.&#8221; How this all happens is explained in a wonderfully personal and engaging narrative voice that ranges from Heidegger to The Lord of the Rings to the Tardis to Op Art, and the second half of the book introduces some of the consequences of and opportunities created by thinking with hyperobjects. It is about global warming and intimacy and object-oriented ontology and modern art and the possibilities of a phenomenology after we get rid of any notion of &#8220;the world&#8221; as something out-there and beyond-us. For those who are interested in STS and its environs, it offers a very different and very thoughtful language for articulating narratives beyond a simple &#8220;object agency&#8221; frame or a human/object binary. It&#8217;s also a great pleasure to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Parapsychology. You may have heard of it. You know, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis. Spoon-bending and that sort of thing. If you have heard of it, you probably think of it as a pseudoscience. And indeed it is. But it wasn&#8217;t always so. There was a time in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when practitioners and advocates of parapsychology abounded. William James, one of the very founders of modern psychological science, was a fan. Most of the founders of modern psychology, of course, weren&#8217;t fans. They considered the parapsychologists frauds peddling cheap tricks to gullible people. These con-men, they said, gave true psychological science a bad name.  There was only one thing to do: unmask them.<br />
As <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/health/people/index.php?dept=P&amp;mid=645753" target="_blank">Michael Pettit</a> shows in his fascinating book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226923746/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Science of Deception: Psychology and Commerce in America</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2013), that is precisely what the scientific psychologists did, or at least tried to do. They worked hard to create a firm boundary between their legitimate practice and what they considered illegitimate trickery. In so doing, they developed a science of deception, one that had far reaching implications for science, the law, and commerce in the United States. Listen in.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When you open <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/anthropology/people/fulltime/eduardokohn/" target="_blank">Eduardo Kohn</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520276116/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">How Forests Think: Toward an Anthropology beyond the Human </a>(University of California Press, 2013), you are entering a forest of dreams: the dreams of dogs and men, dreams about policemen and peccaries, dreams prophetic and dreams instrumental. In this brilliant new ethnography of a village in Ecuador&#8217;s Upper Amazon, those dreams are woven into the lives and deaths of a bookful of selves (both human and non-human) to help readers reconsider what it means to be a thinking, living being and why it matters to anthropology, science studies, and beyond. In creating this &#8220;anthropology beyond the human,&#8221; Kohn calls into question our tendency to conflate representation with language, rethinking the relationship between human language and other forms of representation that humans share with other beings. Here, human lives are both emergent from and contiguous with a wider semiotic community of were-jaguars and sphinxes, barking dogs and falling pigs, men and women alive and dead, walking stick insects and tanagers, spirit masters and rubber trees. It is a transformative, inspiring, and critically meticulous book that deserves a wide readership and rewards close reading.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

As computers were introduced into biology, they changed the nature of biological questions. Hallam traces the resulting reshaping of the practices, problems, and objects of biology, guiding readers through the pipeline to watch the transformation from material to digital as biological samples move through computational programs, get translated into ontologies, and become data. The histories of biology, computing, database technology, and bioinformatic imaging all play a role in this wonderfully trans-disciplinary story.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Richards</a> explores the history of biology and so much more. The eight essays collected in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022605893X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Was Hitler a Darwinian?: Disputed Questions in the History of Evolutionary Theory</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2013), include reflections on  Darwin&#8217;s theories of natural selection and divergence, Ernst Haeckel&#8217;s life and work, the evolutionary ideas of Herbert Spencer, the linguistic theories of August Schleicher, and the historical tendency to relate Hitler&#8217;s Nazism to Darwinian evolutionary theory. Individually, the essays are models of close and careful reading of the documentary traces of the life and work of Darwin, Haeckel, and others, and include some exceptionally affecting and tragic moments. Many of them touch on evolutionary theory&#8217;s moral character, its roots in Romanticism, and its conception of mankind. In addition to offering a fascinating set of case studies in the history of biology, the essays and appendices also collectively raise some important questions about how historians understand the past and bring it into narrative existence. What kind of thing is the past? What sets the history of science apart from other historical disciplines? Is it reasonable to use contemporary science to help construe the past? What is a scientific theory and where is it located? What does it mean to ask (and what might it look like to carefully answer) a question like, Was Hitler a Darwinian? The essays in Richards&#8217; collection are wonderfully reflective considerations that reward the time and attention of both specialists in the history of biology and thoughtful general readers alike.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;A good wife and a healthy child are better for one&#8217;s temper than frogs.&#8221;<br />
For <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/CLAS/Departments/history/faculty/Pages/GabrielFinkelstein.aspx" target="_blank">Gabriel Finkelstein</a>, Emil du Bois-Reymond was &#8220;the most important forgotten intellectual of the nineteenth century.&#8221; Most famously in a series of experimental works on electricity, but also in a series of public lectures that generated very strong, furious responses, du Bois-Reymond galvanized (ha! see what I did there? galvanized? electricity?) nineteenth century publics of all sorts. In Emil du Bois-Reymond: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262019507/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany </a>(MIT Press, 2013), Finkelstein considers how someone so famous and so important could end up so forgotten, and he does a masterful job in rectifying that situation. The book traces du Bois-Reymond&#8217;s life and work, from a childhood in Berlin, to an early life and schooling in Bonn, and then back to Berlin and beyond in the course of a mature career in laboratories and lecture halls. We meet the scientist as teacher, as writer, and as public and university intellectual, and follow his transformation from Romantic to Lucretian and his dual existence as simultaneously staunch individual and product of his class and culture. The chapters are beautifully written, and range from exploring diary pages and love letters to laboratory equipment, with stopovers to consider frog pistols and hopping dances of joy along the way. Whether du Bois-Reymond was accepting the advice of his friends (as offered above) or avoiding his underwear-proffering mother-in-law (of which you&#8217;ll hear more in the conversation), he emerges here as not just an important historical figure, but also a fascinating person who&#8217;s a joy to read about. Enjoy!<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.princeton.edu/history/people/display_person.xml?netid=creager" target="_blank">Angela Creager</a>&#8216;s deeply researched and elegantly written new book is a must-read account of the history of science in twentieth-century America. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022601780X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Life Atomic: A History of Radioisotopes in Science and Medicine </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013) traces a history of radioisotopes as military and civilian objects, for experimentation and therapeutic use, from the 1930s through the late twentieth century. Creager follows the emergence of a political and economic market for radioisotopes, looking carefully at their use as controversial political instruments, as representations of the benefits of atomic energy for US citizens, and as commodities.<br />
After six chapters that trace these broader contexts of the production and circulation of radioisotopes, the second half of the book offers a set of fascinating case studies that explore representative users and uses of the technology in biochemistry, molecular biology, medicine, and ecology. Aspects of the story touch on the history of scientific and medical research using human and animal subjects, the early history of radiation therapy, and the history of ecology and environmental science. Not only is it a historiographically important and meticulously crafted work based on exhaustive research, but it&#8217;s also a great set of stories. The pages of Life Atomic are full of guinea pigs, scientific vaudeville, and stories and characters from many different fields of the modern life sciences, expertly weaving them together into a compelling set of arguments. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The story begins with Davy Crockett and his hunting dogs chasing a bear in 1826. The bear gets caught in an earthquake crack, an effect of the great Mississippi Valley earthquakes of 1811-1812 that are now collectively known as the New Madrid earthquakes. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022605389X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lost History of the New Madrid Earthquakes</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.umb.edu/academics/cla/faculty/conevery_bolton_valencius" target="_blank">Conevery Bolton Valencius</a> beautifully narrates a riveting tale of the production and forgetting of knowledge surrounding these earthquakes, massively disruptive events that liquefied the soil in much of the Mississippi floodplain and briefly made the Mississippi River flow backward. Valencius situates these events in the New Madrid seismic zone within their past, present, and possible futures. We are treated to the perspectives of those who experienced the quakes and their transformation of New Madrid into a hinterland, from river travelers and writers to the &#8220;Shawnee Prophets&#8221; Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa. Because of the wide range of historical actors treated in the book, the account is of relevance not only to the histories of early American science and environmental studies, but also to the histories of religious practice and native American politics and culture. Undoubtedly a rich and fascinating story, The Lost History of the New Madrid Earthquakes is also a special pleasure to read, thanks to the warm (and often very funny) asides and anecdotes with which Valencius peppers the book. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Men and women are different, there&#8217;s no doubt about it. And you might well want to know what the root of that difference is. What makes a man a man and a woman a woman? Before the beginning of the twentieth century, most answers to this question were rather unsatisfying, unless of course you like your answers religio-mythical or pseudo-scientific. Then scientists discovered a genetic difference that seemed to correspond to sexual dimorphism: the 23rd pair of chromosomes was XX in (almost all) human females and XY in (almost all) human males. Thus was a research program born, one prefect for the age of molecular genetics: the search for &#8220;sex itself.&#8221;<br />
In her fascinating book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022608468X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Sex Itself: The Search for Male and Female in the Human Genome</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hsdept/bios/richardson.html" target="_blank">Sarah S. Richardson</a> explores the ways in which molecular geneticists pursued this program and, just as importantly, the ways in which their &#8220;findings&#8221; were molded by contemporary attitudes toward sex and gender. The science we see in Sex Itself is not just about &#8220;the facts&#8221;; it&#8217;s about facts embedded in culture. She shows how the two&#8211;sexual science and culture&#8211;did a sort of dance, each leading the other about the floor of public discourse. Sometimes the dance is beautiful; other times the dancers stumble all over each other. Listen in to our lively discussion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Collectively, they blend approaches from ethnography and science studies. Readers who are interested in historical ontologies, the concretion of new diseases and illnesses, the history of pharmaceutics and drug use, local styles of medical and clinical reasoning, the politics of healing, and the spaces of experimentation will find much of interest here. Eugene and Will generously made time to talk with me about the volume itself the workshop with which it began, and their own fascinating contributions on addiction medicine in Russia and methamphetamine addiction in rural West Virginia.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I always learn something when I interview authors, but in this chat with  <a href="http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofHistoryandAnthropology/Staff/AcademicStaff/DrToddWeir/" target="_blank">Todd H. Weir</a> I learned something startling: I&#8217;m a monist. What is more, you may be a monist too and not even know it. Do you believe that there is really only one kind of stuff and that everything we observe&#8211;and our powers of observation themselves&#8211;are made of that stuff? If so, you&#8217;re a monist.<br />
But what kind? As Todd explains, the history of monism is not monistic: since its birth in the nineteenth century, there have been multiple monisms (which, you must admit, is a diverting irony). You can read about many of them in  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0230113737/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Monism: Science, Philosophy, Religion, and the History of a Worldview</a> (Palgrave, 2012), the edited volume Todd and I discuss in the interview. Despite their differences, all the monisms were radical, for they implied that there was no God and that religion was essentially an evolved superstition. This being so, monism was always controversial. It still is. Stephen J. Gould didn&#8217;t like it, but his colleague E.O. Wilson and most of the &#8220;New Atheists&#8221; do. Listen in and see where you stand.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Is genetic testing a new national obsession? From reality TV shows to the <a href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/genetics/magazine/15-12/ff_genomics?currentPage=all" target="_blank">wild proliferation</a> of home testing kits, there&#8217;s ample evidence it might just be. And among the most popular tests of all is for so-called &#8220;Native American DNA.&#8221;<br />
All of this rests upon some uninterrogated (and potentially destructive) assumptions about race and human &#8220;origins,&#8221; however. In <a title="Native American DNA" href="http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/native-american-dna" target="_blank">Native American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2013), Kim TallBear asks what&#8217;s at stake for Indigenous communities and First Nations when the premises of this ascendant science are put into practice.<br />
<a title="Kim TallBear's Website" href="http://www.kimtallbear.com/" target="_blank">TallBear</a>, an Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Texas-Austin and enrolled <a title="Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate of The Lake Traverse Reservation" href="http://www.swo-nsn.gov/" target="_blank">Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate</a>, conducted years of research on the politics of &#8220;human genome diversity,&#8221; decoding the rhetoric of scientists, for-profit companies, and public consumers. The result is a vital and provocative work, tracing lineages between racial science and genetic testing, &#8220;blood talk&#8221; and &#8220;DNA talk,&#8221; and the undemocratic culture of a field which claims it can deliver us from racism.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Thomas traces the history of self-released audio from its origins in mail-art networks of the 1970s to the present day practice of using antiquated media &#8211; the humble cassette tape &#8211; for the dissemination of experimental sounds. Net-labels, mp3 blogs, tape traders, and their many casts of characters are examined along the way as changing technologies impact the strategies for resilience among self-releasing audio artists.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[A new understanding of animals was central to how Japanese people redefined their place in the natural world in the nineteenth century. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520271866/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Nature of the Beasts: Empire and Exhibition at the Tokyo Imperial Zoo</a> (University of California Press, 2013), <a href="http://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/miller.php" target="_blank">Ian Jared Miller</a> explores this transformation and its reverberations in a fascinating study of the emergence of an &#8220;ecological modernity&#8221; at the Ueno Zoo in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Miller considers how imperialist expansion reshaped what the &#8220;natural world&#8221; was and how it was represented in the context of the zoo. He also looks carefully at the transformations of the zoological garden in wartime, when the core mission of the Ueno Zoo shifted from public education and imperial entertainment to mobilization for total war, including a &#8220;Great Zoo Massacre&#8221; in which the zoo&#8217;s most famous and valuable animals were systematically slaughtered in the summer of 1943. The zoo was reimagined in the postwar period, including the establishment of a new children&#8217;s zoo and a repopulation with gift animals from China, the US, and beyond.<br />
In addition to its compelling arguments and affecting narratives of Japan&#8217;s modern animal ecologies in the context of empire and beyond, The Nature of the Beasts also offers a paper bestiary of dancing bears, Bactrian camels proudly displayed as war trophies, horses that served as &#8220;animal soldiers&#8221; in wartime, a chimpanzee named Suzie who met the emperor, pandas who functioned as &#8220;living stuffed animals&#8221; and biotechnologies, and two beloved elephants that were deliberately starved to death as part of a series of wartime animal sacrifices. It is a wonderful book and it was a pleasure to talk with Ian about it. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We tend to understand the nuclear age as a historical break, a geopolitical and technological rupture. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262017261/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Being Nuclear: Africans and the Global Uranium Trade</a> (MIT Press, 2012), <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hechtg/" target="_blank">Gabrielle Hecht</a> transforms this understanding by arguing instead that nuclearity is a process, a phenomenon, a property distributed among and across objects. In this multi-sited study of several localities in Africa, Hecht weaves together narratives of atomic history, African history, and the histories of mining, economies, and health. Part I of the book looks carefully at the invention of a global market in uranium, exploring the place of African ores in a worldwide uranium trade in a series of accounts of the market and technopolitics in areas that include Niger, Gabon, Namibia, Europe, and the US. Part II focuses on the bodies and work of African mine workers and the production of nuclearity in the context of occupational health in locations that include Madagascar, Gabon, South Africa, and Namibia. Being Nuclear is grounded on several years of research extending across multiple media of historical evidence, including interviews, archives of very different sorts in different places, and experiences in underground mine shafts, haul pits, and other spaces of the story. It is a fascinating, transformative, and important study.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How does conducting fieldwork on another planet, using a robot as a mobile laboratory, change what it means to be a scientist? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/026201775X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Working on Mars: Voyages of Scientific Discovery with the Mars Exploration Rovers</a> (MIT Press, 2012), <a href="http://bill.clancey.name/" target="_blank">William J. Clancey</a> explores the nature of exploration in the context of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) missions of the first decade of the twenty-first century.<br />
From 2002-2005 (and with additional interviews thereafter), Clancey led a group of computer and social scientists who acted as participant observers of the MER science team. The resulting book is a fascinating study of the scientists and engineers on the team, their living and working conditions, the relationship of their project to other exploratory and laboratory contexts in the history of science, and the implications of their work for current and future interplanetary missions. Working on Mars beautifully uses rich ethnographic fieldwork to open up larger conceptual issues for the field of science studies, while never losing sight of the aesthetic, personal, and professional lives of MER scientists as individuals. Readers will learn about what it&#8217;s like to live on local Mars time, how virtuality is crucial to the experience of MER scientists and engineers, what it means for a scientific team to share a robotic laboratory-body, and why understanding and communicating the poetics of this research may be crucial to realizing the goals of space exploration in the future. It is a wonderful, rich, and sensitively-wrought account.<br />
Working on Mars was recently awarded the Gardner-Lasser Aerospace History Literature Award by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Congratulations, Bill!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Craig</a>&#8216;s beautifully written and carefully argued new book about Tibetan medical practices and cultures: How is efficacy determined, and what is at stake in those determinations?<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520273249/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Healing Elements: Efficacy and the Social Ecologies of Tibetan Medicine </a>(University of California Press, 2012)guides readers through the ecologies of mind, body, and society within which Sowa Rigpa is practiced, understood, and transformed from rural Nepal to New York City. The first two chapters each chronicle a day spent in one of the main ethnographic sites featured in the book: a rural clinic and school in Mustang, Nepal; and a major medical institution in urban China. After this grounding in the wide varieties of experience that might collectively fall under the category of &#8220;Tibetan medicine,&#8221; the following chapters explore how associated people, objects, and practices engage with the opportunities and challenges posed by encounters in very different contexts. These contexts range from warehouses meant to prepare drugs for the global pharmaceutical market, to government-supported medical facilities in Nepal and China, to dissertation defenses, to private clinics in a variety of towns and cities, to fields in which medicinal drugs grow wild, to randomized clinical drug trials. It is a fascinating story, a moving and engaging narrative, and a pleasure to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

What you&#8217;ve just read (assuming that you&#8217;ve gotten here via the list above) is a very particular form of knowledge-making. It is a list, a catalogue, a community of things. It is also a kind of travelogue, a &#8220;Latour litany&#8221; that maps some of the objects populating <a href="http://www.bogost.com/" target="_blank">Ian Bogost</a>&#8216;s beautifully written and wonderfully stimulating new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816678987/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Alien Phenomenology, or What It&#8217;s Like to Be a Thing</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2012). Opening with a piece of a They Might Be Giants song and ending with a part of a poem by Charles Bukowski, Bogost&#8217;s book introduces readers to the field of object-oriented ontology by asking us to consider a fundamental question: why do we ignore &#8220;stuff&#8221; in scholarship, poetry, science, or business as anything more than a way to continue talking about humans? Is there a way to think and live with stuff in the world that doesn&#8217;t reduce it to that which concerns people, but instead considers and lives with it on its own terms? Alien Phenomenology helps us explore this question and understand the stakes of the problem in five chapters that each introduce a key concept informing a discussion of the being of objects in our world: &#8220;tiny ontology&#8221; as a model for thinking with things, ontography as a means of mapping them as parts and wholes, metaphorism as a way of getting at the experiences of nonhumans, carpentry as a philosophical practice, and wonder. Though it will be of special interest to readers with an interest in literature, philosophy, and the humanities, the book itself speaks beyond any single disciplinary frame. From the perspective of science studies or STS, it offers a way of moving with and beyond the language of Actor-Network Theory and &#8220;agency&#8221; of the non-human world, potentially helping us to reframe our questions about objects and the narratives of science, medicine, technology, and modernity in innovative ways. (At the very least, it has been transformative for this historian of science.) Not only is it thoughtfully argued and elegantly (at times, gorgeously) written, but it&#8217;s also a lot of fun.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We tend to understand the modernization of Japan as a story of its rise as a techno-superpower. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804785392/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">East Asia: Technology, Ideology, and Empire in Japan&#8217;s Wartime Era, 1931-1945</a> (Stanford University Press, 2013), <a href="https://webapp4.asu.edu/directory/person/1268757" target="_blank">Aaron Stephen Moore</a> critiques this account in a study of the relationship between technology and power in the context of Japanese fascism and imperialism. Moore traces the emergence of a &#8220;technological imaginary&#8221; in wartime Japan, exploring how different groups (including intellectuals, technology bureaucrats, engineers, and state planners) invested the term &#8220;technology&#8221; with ideological meaning and power in the course of discussing and shaping national policy. Paying careful attention to the ways that technological and colonial development co-produced and challenged each other, Moore&#8217;s story respects the archives of both text and practice: the book deeply cuts into into the intellectual history of technology in the context of Japanese empire, while also following the activities, material difficulties, and large-scale products of many thousands of engineers as they traveled to Korea, Taiwan, Manchukuo, and China to build roads, canals, ports, dams, cities, irrigation, sewage and water works, and electrical and communications networks. It is a fascinating case study that informs a larger global historiography of the modern technosciences, while also using the social study of technology to extend the historiography of Japanese empire.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Between WWII and the 1970s, prominent researchers from various fields established and defended a view that emotions are integral to the self, and that a mother&#8217;s love determines an individual&#8217;s emotional development. In <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/vicedo/vicedoca/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Marga Vicedo</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022602055X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Nature and Nurture of Love: From Imprinting to Attachment in Cold War America</a>  (University of Chicago Press, 2013), Marga Vicedo explores the emergence of the science of children&#8217;s emotional needs in the twentieth century. Masterfully bringing together approaches from the history and philosophy of the biological sciences, Vicedo&#8217;s book focuses on British psychoanalyst and psychiatrist John Bowlby (1907-1990), whose ethological work became one of the most influential and controversial psychological theories of the 20th century. Vicedo uses the story of Bowlby&#8217;s science to explore a broader modern history of work on animal and human behavior that includes Konrad Lorenz, Anna Freud, Benjamin Spock, and Niko Tinbergen, among others. Along the way, The Nature &amp; Nurture of Love chronicles the emergence of a kind of anthropomorphic material culture of the human sciences, inhabiting its story with a fascinating cast of robots, dolls, geese, monkeys, and stuffed animals, as well as humans. It is a fascinating and gripping trans-disciplinary story and an absolute pleasure to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During the 1924-25 school year, John Scopes was filling in for the regular biology teacher at Rhea County Central High School in Dayton, Tennessee. The final exam was coming up, and he assigned reading from George W. Hunter&#8217;s 1914 textbook A Civic Biology to prepare students for the test. What followed has become one of the most well-known accounts in the history of science and one of the most famous trials of twentieth-century America.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022602945X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Trying Biology: The Scopes Trial, Textbooks, and the Anti-Evolution Movement in American Schools </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/history/our-staff/full-time-academic-staff/dr-adam-shapiro" target="_blank">Adam R. Shapiro</a> urges us to look beyond the rubrics of &#8220;science&#8221; and &#8220;religion&#8221; to understand how the Scopes trial became such an important event in the histories of both.  The story begins with a pair of Pinkerton detectives spying on a pair of textbook salesmen in the Edwards Hotel in Jackson, Mississippi. Shapiro brings us from that hotel room into a series of classrooms, boardrooms, and courtrooms while exploring the battle over textbook reform in the twentieth-century US. Based on a close reading of high school curricular materials around the discipline of botany, with special attention to the emergence of &#8220;civic botany&#8221; as a pedagogical field, Shapiro&#8217;s book uses the debates over pedagogy, evolution, and the textbook industry to explore a number of issues that are of central importance to the history of science: the construction of authorship, the histories of reading practices, the co-emergence of economies and technologies, and the ways that urban and rural localities shape the nature of sciences and their publics. It is a gripping, moving, and enlightening story. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For a patient choosing among available forms of healing in the medical marketplace of mid-20th century South Korea, the process was akin to shopping. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804784116/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Reconstructing Bodies: Biomedicine, Health, and Nation-Building in South Korea Since 1945 </a>(Stanford University Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/hist/about/hisjpd.htm" target="_blank">John DiMoia</a> explores emergence of that marketplace in the context of a confluence between biomedicine, bodies, and the nation in South Korea since the last half of the 20th century. In a series of case studies that range from quarantine efforts after the arrival of the U.S. Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) to plastic surgery in today&#8217;s South Korea, DiMoia traces a number of themes through his history of biomedicine and healing: the gradual transition from German/Japanese academic medicine to American and international models of medicine; a corresponding embracing of diverse forms of bodily intervention; and the ultimate adoption of private models of health care in modern South Korea. We meet several fascinating characters in the course of the narrative, from practitioners of traditional Korean medicine, to groundbreaking vascular surgeons, to men and women whose bodies became the testing grounds for reform in birth control technologies.<br />
DiMoia&#8217;s account introduces public health practices that included spraying of human bodies with DDT, surgical practices that transformed the spaces and bodies of medicine mid-20th century South Korea, and antiparasitic practices that saw thousands of children bring stool samples to school. It is a rich account of a hybrid medical ecology with moments that would collectively make up a riveting fictional novel if they weren&#8217;t all true. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In our digital world, it does seem like paper is dying by inches. Bookstores are going out of business, and more and more people get their news from the internet than from newspapers. But how irrelevant has paper really become? As <a href="http://www.iansansom.net/" target="_blank">Ian Samson</a> argues in his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062241435/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Paper: An Elegy</a> (Harper Collins, 2012), not only is paper still vital in our society, it pretty much dominates all our lives. From advertising to currency, to board games and origami, paper still revolves around most business and leisure. Even &#8220;post-paper&#8221; products, such as e-readers, imitate the aesthetics and feel of paper, mirroring it in spirit if not in product. And how many of us have heard, &#8220;yes, I have an e-book reader, but I just really like the feel of a book in my hand&#8221;? In this interview, Ian Samson tells us about the history of paper, its uses throughout time, and our love affair with the &#8220;ultimate man-made material.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/timmaudlin.html" target="_blank">Tim Maudlin</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691143099/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time </a>(Princeton University Press, 2012) is a clear, approachable, and engaging introduction to the philosophy of physics that focuses on fundamental notions of space and time. The book expertly interweaves the history and philosophy of science in the course of its narrative; readers will explore the historical development of ideas about space and time in the course of learning the outlines and intricacies of some of the most powerful physical concepts in the history of science. Maudlin is an expert teacher in these pages, using material examples to explain and explore aspects of the philosophy of physics from the geometrical structure of space to the topology of time. Over the course of our conversation, we talked about the place of the volume within the larger trajectory of Maudlin&#8217;s work, the ways that his experience as a student and a teacher of the philosophy of physics has shaped the volume, and some of the ways that the work significantly departs from similar introductions to the field.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226731707/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Gaia Hypothesis: Science on a Pagan Planet </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013), <a href="http://philosophy.fsu.edu/content/view/full/35805" target="_blank">Michael Ruse</a> offers a fascinating history of the Gaia Hypothesis in the context of the transformations of professional and public engagements with science and technology in the 1960s. Based on an archive that spans texts, oral histories, and interviews with some of its major figures, The Gaia Hypothesis charts the development of the idea of the earth as a self-regulating organism. Ruse explores the development of the idea by Lynn Margulis and James Lovelock, and analyzes the nature and bases of the reactions to Margulis and Lovelock&#8217;s ideas from within different scientific and public communities. All of this is contextualized in a deep history of the different world concepts and philosophies of nature that informed the heated debate over Gaia, considering the idea of the earth as organism and nature as a self-regulating system in a range of texts that include Plato&#8217;s Timaeus, the work of German idealists, and the anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner, among many others. (The attentive reader will also note a surprising connection between Gaia and William Golding&#8217;s Lord of the Flies.) The book is full of empathetic, insightful, and often very funny portraits of Margulis, Lovelock, and a community of other figures associated with Gaia and its histories. It is also a wonderfully lively and readable narrative. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Prentice offers a fascinating window into the aspects of medical education that produce the technical, ethical, and affective modes of the medical and surgical self. It is a sensorily-grounded, embodied ethnography that considers its bodies &#8211; of cadavers, of surgeons, of computer programs, of students, of patients &#8211; simultaneously as material entities and active participants in the narrative.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Like it or not, the American Psychiatric Association&#8217;s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) has an enormous influence in deciding what qualifies as a mental health disorder in the United States and beyond. The each revision of the DSM directly influences people&#8217;s lives, guides treatment, and has important legal and economic consequences.  In her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195382234/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Making of DSM-III: A Diagnostic Manual&#8217;s Conquest of American Psychiatry </a>(Oxford University Press, 2013), history professor <a href="http://www.uh.edu/class/history/faculty-and-staff/decker_h/index.php" target="_blank">Hannah S. Decker</a> explores the history of the important third revision of DSM. DSM-III was revolutionary at the time because it changed the field of psychiatry from a generally psychoanalytic approach to a more symptom-based, medical model of diagnosis. Through the use of archival sources and interviews with people who were involved in its creation, Dr. Decker paints a picture of the DSM-III in the 1970s. She also explores the landscape of psychiatry before, during, and after the creation of DSM-III. Dr. Decker&#8217;s work is important in understanding the context and controversies that surround the DSM, which continue to this day with the recent release of DSM-V. This book will be of interest to people interested in the history of medicine and psychiatry, clinicians and researchers in any mental health discipline, and anyone who is interested in ongoing debates about the field of psychiatry.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How do you measure a star?<br />
In the middle of the 20thcentury, an interdisciplinary and international community of scientists began using radio waves to measure heavenly bodies and transformed astronomy as a result. <a href="http://johnjay.jjay.cuny.edu/profiles/history.aspx?key=%5Bemail%5D='dmunns@jjay.cuny.edu'" target="_blank">David P. D. Munns</a>&#8216;s new book charts the process through which radio astronomers learned to see the sounds of the sky, creating a new space for Cold War science.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262018330/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">A Single Sky: How an International Community Forged the Science of Radio Astronomy</a> (MIT Press, 2012) uses the emergence of radio astronomy to upend some of the commonly-held assumptions about the history of the modern sciences. Munns emphasizes the relative freedom of radio astronomers that stands in contrast to the popular meta-narrative of Cold War scientists bound by the interests of the military-industrial complex. He also shifts our focus from the more commonly-studied individual local and national contexts of science to look instead at scientific communities that transcended disciplinary and national boundaries, blending accounts of Australia, the UK, the Netherlands, and the US into a story that emphasizes the importance of cooperation (not  competition) in driving scientific development. In addition to this,  A Single Sky  pays special attention to the importance of material culture (especially that of big radio telescopes) and pedagogy in shaping modern radio astronomy. It&#8217;s a fascinating story. Enjoy!<br />

Each chapter is supplemented by short vignettes that introduce noteworthy texts, important concepts, or examples relevant to and contemporary with the material in the chapter. Taken together, the resulting volume can be used and enjoyed by a wide range of readers, from instructors and students in a university classroom to interested browsers on a Sunday afternoon in the park. It&#8217;s a phenomenal accomplishment and makes for an enjoyable and compelling read. In the course of our conversation, we talked about a wide range of issues germane to the volume, the research and writing of each of the editors, and the wider field of medicine and healing in China.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Dorothea was a widow who treated Martin Luther, the Duke of Saxony, and throngs of poor peasants with her medicinal waters. Anna was the powerful wife of the Elector of Saxony who favored testing medical remedies on others before using them on her friends and family. Elisabeth was an invalid patient whose preferred treatments included topical remedies and ministrations from the &#8220;almighty physician,&#8221; but never &#8220;the smear.&#8221; We meet these three lively women in the pages of <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/history/faculty/rankin.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alisha Rankin</a>&#8216;s wonderful new book on the medical practices of noblewomen from the last decades of the sixteenth century. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226925382/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panaceia&#8217;s Daughters: Noblewomen as Healers in Early Modern Germany</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2013) considers the intellectual and social contexts of healing practices in early modern Germany, focusing on elite women who spent much of their adult lives devising and administering medicinal remedies. The book argues that noblewomen were celebrated as healers not despite their gender, but because of it, offering a useful corrective to the historiography of gender and the sciences in early modernity. Rankin situates three in-depth case studies within a careful exploration of some of the main factors that enabled the kind of success that noblewomen-healers like Dorothea of Mansfield and Anna of Saxony enjoyed in sixteenth-century Germany: more opportunities for information exchange through local communities and wider epistolary networks; an increasing focus on empirical knowledge in its many forms; and the foundation role of written medicinal recipes as a form of kunst. It is a thoughtfully written and very clearly argued work that informs many aspects of the history of gender, of science and medicine, and of practical epistemologies.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;This is a history of promises.&#8221;So begins <a href="http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/histmed/people/faculty/comfort.html" target="_blank">Nathaniel Comfort</a>&#8216;s gripping and beautifully written new book on the relationships between and entanglements of medical genetic and eugenics in the history of the twentieth century. Based on a rich documentary and oral history archive, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300169914/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine</a> (Yale University Press, 2012) reframes the histories of early and contemporary human genetics. Rather than treating eugenics as &#8220;a contaminant of good, honest biomedicine,&#8221; the book shows that early human genetics had many of the same basic goals &#8211; human improvement and the relief of suffering &#8211; as genetic medicine today. At the same time, contemporary genetic medicine emerges as much less benign than it has often been depicted.<br />
All of this is accomplished through a sensitive historical tracing of two major approaches to understanding human heredity through the twentieth century: a Galtonian approach characterized by a concern with quantification, public health, and populations; and a Garrodian approach characterized by an interest in conceptualizing the human as individual, and in synthesizing heredity with other forms of knowledge. As we follow these threads along with Comfort, he introduces us to a bookful of colorful, vibrant characters from the history of medical genetics: the idealistic inventor of a &#8220;Gumption Reviver,&#8221; the sanitarium-operator who was fond of prescribing yogurt-enemas, and the medical geneticist with a talent for boogie-woogie piano, among others. These figures are embedded in an exceptionally carefully-wrought narrative of the spaces, practices, and events by which medicine became genetic, genetics became molecular, and molecules made the engineering of humanity possible in a new way.<br />
In the course of our discussion, we talked about the importance, for Comfort, of paying careful attention to elements of the writer&#8217;s craft when composing a historical work. The John McPhee essay on narrative structure that was mentioned in that part of the interview can be found <a href=" http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/14/130114fa_fact_mcphee" target="_blank">here</a> (A subscription to the New Yorker is required to read the full piece.)<br />

He is Adjunct Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School&#8217;s Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, Harvard University. Mele writes as a technology expert and as a witness to history. He served as a campaign staffer for the Howard Dean for President Campaign in 2003. He and his colleagues implemented many of the web-based campaign innovations that resulted in President Obama winning the 2008 presidential election and define the modern American political campaign. Mele links that experience with radical social changes brought about by the internet. His title thesis, The End of Big, suggest that big institutions in nearly every sector of our lives (business, government, news) have been eroded and, in some cases, supplanted by smallness. An enthusiast for technology, Mele also cautions against the risks associated with this transformation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Zograscope. Say it with me: zograscope. ZooooOOOOOoooograscope.<br />
There are many optical wonders in Maki Fukuoka&#8217;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080477790X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Premise of Fidelity: Science, Visuality, and Representing the Real in 19th-Century Japan</a>  (Stanford University Press, 2012), the zograscope not least among them. The book opens with Fukuoka&#8217;s account of stumbling upon a manuscript of a botanical work called the Honzo shasin (1826) while on a trip to Leiden to see a Japanese zograscope, a device that enhanced the sense of depth when looking through it at otherwise flat pictures. Much of the book centers on the history and work of a small community of nineteenth-century scholars called the Shohyaku-sha, the group that produced the Honzo shashin and were interested in the study of materia medica. This focused case study allows Fukuoka to simultaneously stay anchored while opening up to an expansive history of transformations in modes of understanding visuality and evidence of knowledge of the natural world in Tokugawa Japan. As the book guides readers through the changing meanings of the word shashin, a term used to mean &#8220;photography&#8221; in contemporary Japanese, it demonstrates how knowledge of the spheres of textual knowledge, visual illustration, and physical plant specimens mutually reinforced one another while practitioners of the visual arts sought to define and secure relationships of &#8220;fidelity&#8221; among these very different media. This fundamentally trans-disciplinary book offers much of interest to historians of East Asia, of science, and of art: histories of public exhibitions, of natural history, of photography, of anatomical dissection, of translation and typography, and much more can be found within the pages of The Premise of Fidelity. And if I haven&#8217;t already mentioned it, there&#8217;s also a zograscope. What more reason would you need to read it?<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s getting warmer, there ain&#8217;t no doubt about it. What are we going to do? Most folks say we should cut back on bad things like carbon emissions. That would probably be a good idea. The trouble is we would have to cut back on all the good things that carbon emissions produce, like big houses, cool cars, and tasty food imported from far-away places. We don&#8217;t want to do that.<br />
So what&#8217;s a global citizen to do? One idea is to take control of the environment, engineering-wise. Why cut back when we can simply manage the carbon-cycle a bit like we manage the climate in hothouses? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300186673/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate Engineering</a>(Yale UP, 2013),  <a href="http://www.clivehamilton.com/" target="_blank">Clive Hamilton</a> surveys the proposals big-thinking engineers have dreamed up to control the carbon-cycle on a truly massive scale. Some are wacky, others less so, but all are, well, very bold. Does any of it make sense? Can any of it be done? Hamilton investigates.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;The humans are dead.&#8221;<br />
Whether or not you recognize the epigram from Flight of the Conchords (and if not, there are worse ways to spend a few minutes than by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1BdQcJ2ZYY">looking here</a>, and I recommend sticking around for the &#8220;binary solo&#8221;), <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty.aspx?id=1664" target="_blank">Dominic Pettman</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816672997/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Human Error: Species-Being and Media Machines </a>(University of Minnesota Press, 2011) will likely change the way you think about humanity, animals, machines, and the relationships among them. Pettman uses a series of fascinating case studies, from television programs to films to Sufi fables to pop songs, to explore the notion of Agamben&#8217;s &#8220;anthropological machines&#8221; and the human being as a &#8220;technospecies without qualities&#8221; in a modern mediascape that includes Thomas Edison&#8217;s film Electrocuting an Elephant, Werner Herzog&#8217;s Grizzly Man, and the interplanetary soundscape created by NASA (among many, many others). We recently gathered over Skype to talk about some of the major thematic and argumentative threads snaking through this book and Pettman&#8217;s recent exploration of totems in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1780991398/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Look at the Bunny: Totem, Taboo, Technology </a>(Zero Books, 2013). Both books take on the varied ways that love, technology, identity (both human and not), and economies have been transformed in a world that includes pacifist Orcs, voices without bodies, ecologies without nature, reptile-doctors, and pixelated lovers. Enjoy!<br />
During our conversation, Pettman mentions a film about the zigzag totem that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Przck8-fMzI">can be found here.</a><br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There are pigeons, cats, and Martians here. There are CT scanners, dentures, computers large enough to fill rooms, war games, and neural networks. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421404680/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Biomedical Computing: Digitizing Life in the United States </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2012), <a href="http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/hist/Faculty/novemberj.html" target="_blank">Joe November</a> mobilizes this ecology of instruments and objects, people and programs, in a story that maps out the early years of the introduction of computers to biology and medicine from 1955 to 1965. As computing technology was gradually integrated into different spaces of biomedicine that were characterized by agents with very different agendas (a set of processes not without significant contestation), biomedicine and computing transformed one another. Life itself was changed as a result, as the objects of biomedical computing were translated into the kinds of system-entities that computers could describe. The historian of technology who reads November&#8217;s book will find fascinating stories of machines like LINC, ENIAC, and UNIVAC. The historian of science will find accounts of the ways that military funding shaped the computerization of biomedicine, windows into the mid-century work supported by the NIH, stories of the transformation of diagnostic medicine in the US, and chapters from the history of crystallography and molecular biology. The historian of networks and computing will find analyses of the importance of operations research, expert systems, and transdisciplinary research practices to the work of some of the central figures in the history of the computational sciences. In addition to all of this, November&#8217;s book can also be read as a history of the modern personal computer. (There are also men in RNA-themed neckties sprinkled throughout the early part of the story.) Enjoy the interview, and imagine as you listen that you&#8217;re here with me at the National Humanities Center, Skyping with Joe as a thunderstorm booms overhead, rain falls loudly outside the window, and brilliant humanities scholars share excited conversation about their work outside the door. It was a special afternoon.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[History is in many respects the story of humanity&#8217;s quest for transcendence: to control life and death, time and space, loss and memory. When inventors or companies effectively tap into these needs products emerge that help define their times. The Kodak &#8216;Brownie&#8217; allowed average consumers &#8211; without the knowledge of chemistry or math of a Matthew Brady &#8211; to capture powerful images. Ford&#8217;s Model T gave the &#8216;working man&#8217; the ability to travel further and faster than wealthy aristocrats of previous generations. The Timex watch made time accessible to anyone with a few bucks, whether they had interest in philosophical debates about the meaning of time or not. The Glock handgun is on this list of iconic products and while it did not democratize deadly force like the AK-47 it has made its own mark on the American psyche.<br />
The Glock has become the standard bearer for American handguns, placing it at the center of some of the most important conflicts of our times from gun control to globalization. It was initially invented for the Austrian army, but its many innovations and the growing belief that American cops were outgunned by criminals made it first popular with law enforcement, and then later with gun enthusiasts of all types. Tupac Shakur praised the Glock and was later murdered with one. Municipalities railed against the Glock then later helped flood the streets with them. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/authors/1989-paul-m-barrett" target="_blank">Paul Barrett</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307719952/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Glock: The Rise of America&#8217;s Gun</a> (Broadway, 2013) is the story of a gun, but in a nation of 300 million guns, it tells a much larger story.<br />
Paul was kind enough to speak with us. I hope you enjoy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262018381/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Psychophysical Ear: Musical Experiments, Experimental Sounds, 1840-1910</a> (MIT Press, 2013), <a href="http://www.history.msstate.edu/ahui.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandra Hui</a> explores a fascinating chapter of that history in a period when musical aesthetics and natural science came together in the psychophysical study of sound in nineteenth century Germany. Though we tend to consider the performing arts and sciences as occupying different epistemic and disciplinary realms, Hui argues that the scientific study of sound sensation not only was framed in terms of musical aesthetics, but became increasingly so over time. The book traces a series of arguments by practitioners of the study of sound sensation as they sought to uncover universal rules for understanding the sonic world: How much epistemic weight ought to be placed on the experiences of an individual listener? What sorts of expertise were relevant or necessary for a sound scientist&#8217;s experimental practice? Did musical training matter? Was there a proper way to listen to music? The Psychophysical Ear follows sound scientists as they grappled with these and other questions, struggling with the consequences of understanding the act of listening as a practice that was fundamentally grounded in particular historical contexts as phonographic technology and the increasing number of performances of non-Western music in Europe were transforming the sonic world of Europe. Hui&#8217;s story often involves the reader&#8217;s own sensorium in the story, urging us to imagine or play sequences of musical notes that prove crucial to some of the arguments of the actors in the story.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.wm.edu/as/history/faculty/poppernicholas.php" target="_blank">Nicholas Popper</a>&#8216;s new book is a thoughtfully crafted and rich contribution to early modern studies, to the history of history, and to the history of science. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226675009/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Walter Ralegh&#8217;s History of the World and the Historical Culture of the Late Renaissance </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2012) takes readers into the texture of Walter Ralegh&#8217;s masterwork and the textual and epistemic practices through which he used the past to understand and offer counsel on the events of the present. Ralegh passed seven of his many years of incarceration in the Tower of London excerpting, rearranging, editing, and recopying passages from his 500+ volume library to produce a book that has been read and interpreted in many different (and sometimes conflicting) ways in the hundreds of years since its initial printing.<br />
Popper&#8217;s book uses a very focused account of the texture of this single book as a basis from which to offer a wonderfully expansive account of the practices of history in the Renaissance, and the ways that Ralegh&#8217;s work and associated practices of historical analysis ultimately transformed European politics, religion, and scholarship. Along the way, there are fascinating accounts of the origins of the modern archival mode of historiography, the differences between causal and narrative accounts of the past, and the many ways that early modern historical practices were inextricable from scriptural exegesis. Popper&#8217;s study is both inspired by the methods and insights of the historiography of science, and offers a way to think about the practices of knowledge-production that help identify what we&#8217;re talking about when we talk about early modern &#8220;science.&#8221; Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The story starts on a high-speed train and ends with six men in a crater, with hundreds of years and a number of explosions in between. <a href="http://internet2.trincoll.edu/facProfiles/Default.aspx?fid=1261599" target="_blank">Sean Cocco</a>&#8216;s rich new book uses Vesuvius as a focal point for exploring the histories of natural history, travel, observation, imaging, astronomy, and many other aspects of the places and identities of early modern history. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226923711/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Watching Vesuvius: A History of Science and Culture in Early Modern Italy </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013) pays special attention to the many resonances of emplacement and locality, and to the agency of the Vesuvian landscape, as it explores the continuities and transformations in the seventeenth and eighteenth century volcanic landscape. Volcanology emerged along with Neapolitan identity while volcanoes became emblematic of the south in the writings of European travelers: rumbling, unpredictable, given to heated eruptions. Cocco&#8217;s account shows us the beauty of these transformations as they were embodied in paintings, poems, letters, and other media. Scholars and enthusiasts of the urban and political history of Europe will find much of interest here, as will readers interested in the history of vernacular understandings of nature.

Principe</a>&#8216;s new book explores these questions and some possible answers to them in a wonderfully written and argued introduction to the history of western alchemy. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226682951/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Secrets of Alchemy</a>  (University of Chicago Press, 2012) traces the genealogy of alchemical practices from their early Greco-Egyptian foundations through early modern chymistry, pausing along the way to reflect on the reinterpretation and refashioning of alchemy from the eighteenth century to the present. Principe&#8217;s pages reveal histories of alchemy that are wonderfully rich and diverse, and we meet them in laboratories, recipes, images, dramatic plays, and poems. In the course of our conversation, we talked about aspects of the craft of the alchemist as well as that of the historian, including Principe&#8217;s fascinating attempts to recreate alchemical recipes and practices in his own laboratory.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his compelling and fascinating account of how engineers navigated new landscapes of technology and its discontents in 1960s America, <a href="http://www.sts.vt.edu/faculty/wisnioski/" target="_blank">Matthew Wisnioski</a> takes us into the personal and professional transformations of a group of thinkers and practitioners who have been both central to the history of science and technology, and conspicuously under-represented in its historiography. Between 1964 and 1974, engineers in America wrestled with the ethical and intellectual implications of an &#8220;ideology of technological change.&#8221; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262018268/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Engineers for Change: Competing Visions of Technology in 1960s America</a> (MIT Press, 2012) takes us into the debates among engineers over their responsibilities for crafting a future in a world where nuclear weapons and chemical pollutants were now facts of life, as citizens were rising in support of environmental and civil rights, and in protest of war and violence. Wisnioski introduces us to the changing resonances of and debates over key concepts in the print culture of engineers in mid-century America, key experiments in the pedagogy and training of engineers at major US institutions, and key efforts to promote creativity in the profession by collaborating with artists, social activists, and others. The book situates all of this within a wonderful introduction to the classic historiography of social studies of technology and engineering, and is illustrated with striking images from the visual culture of engineering in the 1960s. Readers interested in how these issues extend into the more recent history of technology will also find much of interest in Wisnioski&#8217;s accounts of Engineers Without Borders and the Engineering, Social Justice, and Peace (ESJP) Network.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[By focusing on food and eating from the dinner table to the laboratory, <a title="Interview with E. C. Spary" href="http://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/people/spary.html" target="_blank">E. C. Spary</a>&#8216;s new book shows how an increasingly public culture of knowledge shaped the daily lives of literate Parisians in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Spary&#8217;s work is at the same time a rich and embodied history of food, diet, and digestion in French Enlightenment science, and an account of how social and epistemological authority were produced amid the emergence of new Enlightenment publics. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226768864/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Eating the Enlightenment: Food and the Sciences in Paris, 1670-1760</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012), controversies over digestion provided a space for the working out of power struggles between political, religious, medical, and culinary thinkers. Faced with a cuisine bursting with new materials and flavors, French society debated various ways of negotiating the opposing poles of indulgence and sobriety, luxury and reform. This is illustrated in several detailed case studies that include coffee and its implication in networks of expertise; cafes as social leveling-grounds, performance spaces, and chemical laboratories; and the production of new liqueurs. Spary&#8217;s work urges us to reconsider the way we write commodity histories, and is well worth reading. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://history.barnard.edu/profiles/deborah-coen" target="_blank">Deborah R. Coen</a>&#8216;s new book chronicles how the earthquake emerged and receded as a scientific object through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Half of the chapters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226111814/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Earthquake Observers: Disaster Science from Lisbon to Richter</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012) treat local experiments in planetary science in Scotland, Switzerland, imperial Austria, and California, all places that relied on networks of ordinary citizens in the course of developing modern seismology. The other chapters look at the international circulation of the stories of earthquake witnesses as evidence for an emerging global science of disaster. Coen&#8217;s book is both carefully argued and full of surprises. We learn of Kant producing what was essentially the first work of modern seismology. We learn of a geologist who studied both global tectonics and the ways that some neighborhood drinking-water supplies came from the drainage of cemeteries. We learn of the connection between evidence for earthquakes and ghosts in Britain. (I learned that my hometown of Closter, NJ was the site of an important earthquake observation in the nineteenth century.) The Earthquake Observers excavates a multilingual documentary archive that spans newspapers, seismographs, cartoons, philosophical tracts, romantic letters, and much more. It&#8217;s a fascinating multi-sited study of the changing nature of material and human instruments through which communities have understood modern disasters, and it is well worth reading.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://audrajwolfe.com/" target="_blank">Audra Wolfe</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/142140771X/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Competing with the Soviets: Science, Technology, and the State in Cold War America</a> (John Hopkins University Press, 2013) offers a synthetic account of American science during the Cold War. Wolfe pulls together a rich and disparate literature to provide a thematic, chronological and accessible story about the distinctive ways that Americans wove science and government together for the five decades after WWII. Beyond the familiar story of physics, Wolfe shows not only how science prospered under federal patronage but how the federal government itself came to depend on science as it tried to deal with the problems it faced around the world and at home. The nature of American science, and the promise of american modernity, was put on display in works and institutions as varied modernization theory and the Apollo missions. Wolfe has written a delightful little book offering the historical state of the art for those interested in thinking about the characteristic relationships forged between science and the state during the Cold War and their lasting consequences.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Imagine the academic world as a beach.<br />
The grains of sand making up the beach are the departments, institutes, and other bodies and related gatherings that make up the officially sanctioned parts of academic institutions and academic life. There is a world between the grains, however &#8211; a world of unofficial, accidental, and trans-departmental conversations and inspirations. And it is within that &#8220;interstitial academy&#8221; that some of the most remarkable work in the history of modern social and humanistic thought has been born.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674065743/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Working Knowledge: Making the Human Sciences from Parsons to Kuhn</a> (Harvard University Press, 2012), <a href="http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/jti20@cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">Joel Isaac</a> takes readers into the interstitial academy of Harvard University in the middle of the twentieth century. Isaac traces a kind of early history of interdisciplinarity in the American academy in the course of an elegantly wrought argument for situating one of the most pivotal texts of the history and philosophy of science, Thomas Kuhn&#8217;s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, within the emergence of what have become known as the human sciences. Twentieth century philosophers and social scientists sought to replace Kant&#8217;s transcendental notions with concepts more firmly rooted in the activities of working scientists and mathematicians, creating an epistemology that was deeply rooted in social practices. Maturing in this context and coming of intellectual age largely in the interstitial academy, Kuhn developed a notion of scientific paradigms that were &#8220;revealed in its textbooks, lectures, and laboratory exercises,&#8221; grounding his philosophy in a fundamental concern with pedagogical practices. At the same time, Isaac&#8217;s book is about so much more than Kuhn: it treats the history of American universities, the sociology of Pareto, the development of the case method in legal education, the changing disciplinary relationships between philosophy and psychology, the development of an idea of &#8220;social sciences,&#8221; among many other themes and stories. It is an exceptionally rich and persuasive story, and well worth reading &#8211; be it on the beach or elsewhere.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691155313/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Warriors of the Cloisters: The Central Asian Origins of Science in the Medieval World</a> (Princeton University Press, 2012), <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~ceus/faculty/beckwith.shtml" target="_blank">Christopher I. Beckwith</a> gives us a rare window into the global movements of medieval science. Science can be characterized not by its content, but instead by its methodology. Starting from this premise, Beckwith focuses on a crucial part of this methodology, the recursive argument method. Developed among Central Asian Buddhist scholars, the recursive method was transmitted along with other core elements of medieval science (including the institution of the college) to Muslims in Central Asia, and from there to medieval Western Europe. Beckwith&#8217;s analysis of this transformation is based on a deep knowledge of disputational texts in many languages, and integrates archaeological evidence in a compelling account of the spatial and institutional relationships of the college, the European cloister, the Islamic madrasa, and the Central Asian vihara. The story of<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691155313/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank"> Warriors of the Cloisters</a> ranges widely across India, Tibet, China, and Greco-Roman antiquity, while focusing on a Central Asian context that has largely been absent from global histories of science. It is an important contribution to what will hopefully become an emerging new field of scholarship on Central Asian science, medicine, and technology. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;No one in the history of the world has ever self-identified as a pseudoscientist.&#8221;<br />
From the very first sentence, Michael D. Gordin&#8217;s new book introduces readers to the characters, plotlines, and crises that have shaped the narratives of fringe science since the early twentieth century. Focusing on Cold War America from the late 1940s to the late 1970s, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226304426/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Pseudo-Science Wars: Immanuel Velikovsky and the Birth of the Modern Fringe </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2012) traces the transformations of science at the margins that were stimulated by Immanuel Velikovsky, &#8220;the first grand wizard of the Universal Order of Mass Pseudo-Scholarship&#8221; and a Russian-born psychoanalyst whose Worlds in Collision triggered an epistemic avalanche among members of the American scientific community. Gordin tracks the surprising relationships of Velikovsky and his work, from Zionism to Creationism, and from Freud to Einstein. It becomes a story of competing attitudes toward historical evidence, as the scientific orthodoxy reacted to threats from the margins and those on the margins sought to preserve their own orthodoxy on the fringes. Gordin&#8217;s book is a multi-layered modern history of problem of scientific demarcation as well as a fascinating read. We talked about many aspects of the book, as well as Gordin&#8217;s approach to the craft of research and writing for a book-length project.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[You were amused to find you too could fear<br /><br />
&#8220;The eternal silence of the infinite spaces.&#8221;<br />
The astronomy love poems of William Empson, from which the preceding quote was taken, were just some of the many media through which people explored the ramifications of Einstein&#8217;s ideas about the cosmos in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. Masterfully incorporating a contextual sensibility of the historian of science with a sensitivity to textual texture of the literary scholar, <a href="http://www.english.qmul.ac.uk/staff/pricek.html" target="_blank">Katy Price </a>guides us through the ways that readers and writers of newspapers, popular fiction, poems, magazines, and essays translated and incorporated Einsteinian relativity. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226680738/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Loving Faster Than Light: Romance and Readers in Einstein&#8217;s Universe</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2012) situates this popular engagement with the physical sciences within the political transformations of early twentieth-century Britain, looking at how the scientific and publishing communities attempted (with different levels of success) to use media coverage of relativity to rally the support of a wider reading public. It is a rich study that has much to offer to those interested in the history of science, of literature, and of popular culture, while helpfully complicating all of those categories.<br />
&#8220;Fly with me then to all&#8217;s and the world&#8217;s end<br /><br />
And plumb for safety down the gaps of stars<br /><br />
Let the last gulf or topless cliff befriend,<br /><br />
What tyrant there our variance debars?&#8221;<br />
*Both quotes above are from William Empson&#8217;s poems, and can be found on pages 167 and 162 of Price&#8217;s book.<br />]]></itunes:summary>
