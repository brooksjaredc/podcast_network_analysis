			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sean Penn wrote a novel to slow things down. He fell out of love with making movies, he is disillusioned by the culture, and he finds it hard to draw hope from current events. Sean explains to Marc how writing makes him feel like he's not part of the noise, how he finds strength from the Parkland students, and how an upcoming movie made him feel like he could actually rekindle his love of filmmaking. Also, Lynn Shelton returns to the garage to talk about directing her new movie, Outside In, and explain what it's like to direct Marc.

They can't get to all of them, so Nick tells Marc the ones about football, farming, irrigation, Martin Scorsese, getting arrested, Marlon Brando, Tropic Thunder, Danny McBride, The Thin Red Line, and an epic prank involving Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Also, for Episode 900, Marc commemorates the last days of the Garage at the Cat Ranch.

The prolific playwright-director-novelist-screenwriter talks with Marc about his Chicago roots and how he learned a lot about drama by watching the improv actors at Second City. They also talk about David's theories on acting (very few are good at it), William H. Macy (one of the very few), Eugene O'Neill (he wasn't that great), Shakespeare (he was),  and marriage (you can take a mulligan on the first one). This episode is sponsored by <a href= "https://www.netflix.com/title/80189653" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Ricky Gervais: Humanity on Netflix</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/view/podcasts-page" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="http://amazonmusic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Music</a>, and <a href= "http://www.ifcfilms.com/films/the-death-of-stalin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFC Films' The Death of Stalin</a>.</p>]]></description>

Tracy tries to disabuse Marc of that concern as they talk about the difficult process of writing plays, the compromises made when turning a play into a movie, the pleasures of being in Lady Bird, the fear he had on the set of The Post, and the benefits of being married to another actor.

It makes sense because, as she tells Marc, she always wanted to perform when she was growing up in Buffalo, catching glimpses of musical theater from touring companies in Toronto. Riki and Marc talk about Shakespeare, Clint Eastwood, depression, and her show Another Period. Also, Laurie Kilmartin is back to talk about her new book and have a few laughs about death. This episode is sponsored by <a href= "http://squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://www.proflowers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Perfectly Paired collection from ProFlowers and Shari's Berries</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedian and actor Fortune Feimster joins Marc in the garage fresh off getting engaged to her girlfriend, which feels pretty far away from the young Southern girl who didn't come out as a lesbian or perform comedy until she was in her mid-20s. Fortune tells Marc how she got the nerve to do both, why her grandmother was her rock, and how a random security guard helped her fix the relationship with her mom.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates is one of America's most celebrated and insightful writers. But there's part of him that would be fine with it all going away. Marc and Ta-Nehisi talk about the impulse to pull back when things start to get good, the burden of being treated as a representative for a larger community, and the reason Ta-Nehisi finds Black Panther so relatable. They also discuss two of Ta-Nehisi's biggest influences: James Baldwin and David Carr. This episode is sponsored by <a href= "http://simplisafewtf.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">SimpliSafe</a>.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>At some point after James Franco became a high-profile movie star, he found himself asking, "What if you get everything you want and nothing changes?" As James explains to Marc, that led to a re-engagement with art and academics, a stint on General Hospital, an infamous hosting experience on the Oscars, and many passion projects that he willed to fruition.

John talks with Marc about the music he makes, Ty Segall, Mitch Hedberg, Cuba, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, rock and roll drug casualties, and what it was like to play a concert where a hole opened up in the floor. This episode is sponsored by the new film <a href= "https://twitter.com/3Billboards?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a>, <a href="http://sonos.com" target="_blank" rel= "noopener">Sonos</a>, and <a href="http://capterra.com/wtf" target= "_blank" rel="noopener">Capterra</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But Tracey tells Marc she doesn't consider herself a comedian or a comic, but rather a character actor. The fact that she started performing as a way to cheer up her widowed mother means she's always trying to find sympathetic notes in the characters she's creating, with an ability to mock and humanize simultaneously. Tracey and Marc talk about her TV shows, her family, The Simpsons, and her brief pop music career that led to a friendship with Paul McCartney. This episode is sponsored by <a href= "http://www.cc.com/shows/the-opposition-with-jordan-klepper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Opposition with Jordan Klepper on Comedy Central</a>, <a href="http://stamps.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stamps.com</a>, and <a href="http://casper.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casper</a>.</p>]]></description>
