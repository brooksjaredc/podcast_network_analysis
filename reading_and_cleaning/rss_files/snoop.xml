      <itunes:summary>This week at the GGN News desk, we welcome back, once again, the originator of the now classic Smoker's Studio answer to the question, &quot;If you could have any super power, what would it be?&quot;. Do you remember the answer he gave? If you don't, just go back and peep his first appearance on the GGN. For now, let us proceed with today's show...
Both K Camp and our host, Nemo Hoes, share an affinity for strip clubs, as can be seen and appreciated in Snoop's video for the song, &quot;Trash Bags&quot;, that features his young neffew. They talk about strip club culture, getting plenty of love from the ladies there, and his favorite strip club in Atlanta.
Speaking of The ATL, they also go in about the influence the legendary Jermaine Dupri had on the city's music, specifically in how he sonically brought Atlanta music up to the level where it was as great as anything out there.
Nemo Hoes passes him something special, to the point where our guest is stuck. Don't worry, the smoke clears and he clicks back in, but if it's a goal at the GGN to get our guests so stoned they forget a question, well.. mission accomplished. Join us, won't you?</itunes:summary>

Legendary comedian, actor, producer, and writer Martin Lawrence joins Uncle Snoop on the GGN Podcast this week! After Do The Right Thing, a new young star in Hollywood was born, and Martin's reel hasn't stopped since, starring in all your favorites - including House Party, Blue Streak, Life (which he got to act alongside his idol coming up, Eddie Murphy), Big Momma's House, Bad Boys, and the list goes on...
He chops it up with our host about what it was like making the wildly popular and hilarious sitcom Martin, including which of his various recurring roles he played on the show was his favorite.

      <itunes:summary>We've had some of LA's finest artists on the GGN in the past, and this week we are bringing you a West Coast rapper that's been on the rise - G Perico. In 2016, his album Shit Don't Stop dropped, and when sources like Pitchfork and Fader showed it a lot of love, it just put a stamp on his name that G Perico was going to be a force in the game.
Now, two years later, he slides thru the GGN and joins Nemo Hoes to talk about music, and much more. 
When he realized the streets weren't for him, he put his whole focus on rap. They chop it up about what surprised him about the first show he did in New York and also, what advice he would have for youngsters coming up who come from the same place as him. And if there was any doubt, he makes one thing absolutely clear - that he will be rocking a Jheri Curl for life! We all win when the Curl is alive and well.</itunes:summary>

This week on the GGN, Nemo Hoes sits down and chops it up with the man responsible for directing Juice and many other classic films - Ernest Dickerson joins us at the desk!
He gives us an insider's look into the making of Juice, including a priceless story of a lady's number Tupac was actually thankful he didn't get! Also, little known fact - he was able to get a role for his mother in the movie, playing the role of Sweets.
Classic Hip Hop flick-heads will also know the movie Ernest specifically cast for Nemo back in the day, when he directed the thriller Bones, starring Nemo in the role of Jimmy Bones, opposite the amazing and timeless Pam Grier. Ernest talks about what he saw in him as a potential lead role, and they reminisce about how much fun they had during the making of the film.
Ernest is still busy as ever, recently directing the drama film Double Play that came out in 2017, as well as numerous episodes of the AMC hit series, The Walking Dead.
This is an all-time, classic episode of the GGN, ya'll, so come through and put one in the air with us. Chuuch.</itunes:summary>

You know her from many of your favorite movies, including her role opposite another legendary actor, James Caan, in the classic suspense/thriller Misery, as well as a slightly less disturbing role playing one Bobby Boucher Jr.'s mother in the hilarious comedy Waterboy.
Nemo Hoes chats it up with her about how she got those roles and even gets her to admit she didn't know who Adam Sandler was prior to Waterboy! They also talk future projects and roles she would like to play, which she skillfully connects back to in our Smoker's Studio questions, with one of the best answers we've ever heard!
You can catch Kathy currently on Disjointed, a new show out on Netflix, where she plays a weed-loving hippy named Ruth Whitefeather Feldman who gets her dream of opening a weed dispensary.
Pass that, Ms. Bates!</itunes:summary>

To kick off the festivities, we invited all our friends, new and old, to celebrate with us - Bishop Don “Magic” Juan, Ha Ha Davis, Too $hort, Luenell, Michael Blackson, Karrueche Tran, Fatboy SSE, Slink Johnson, and Supreme Patty.
It wouldn't be a real Christmas party amongst family if there wasn't a little drama to go with that turkey and sweet potato pie, and Luenell gives it to Karrueche straight! But as you'd expect (or not), the mood is lightened considerably when talk of Hollywood's recent run of sexual allegations come up. Hmmm.
All of the usual traditions of gift giving, sharing a meal together, and a game of Crackers breaks out. Thanks for sharing, Karrueche, but yeah.. we still don't understand the game either.
Pull up with some egg nog and maybe a little mistletoe for you and yours, nephew. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, u-bitch-u!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Chi-Town representative Chief Keef has steadily been flooding the streets with new music, and he took a break from the studio to slide thru the GGN this week. Nemo Hoes asks him about all things Chi' - including being a part of the new wave of artists from the city, getting to work with Kanye West, what he loves most about &quot;Chi-raq&quot;, and being one of the pioneers of a style of music that originated on the South Side - drill music. They also get into more pressing matters, like their favorite ice cream flavors, and he teaches Nemo something new about rolling up - imagine that!?!?!</itunes:summary>
