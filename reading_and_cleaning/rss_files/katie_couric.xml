        <![CDATA[<p>Kara&nbsp;Swisher&nbsp;is perhaps the most feared—and effective—journalist in tech. She first made a splash covering AOL in the 1990s and she's continued to scoop Silicon Valley players ever since. In this crossover episode with Kara’s podcast, Katie and Kara discuss the competition between Instagram and Snapchat, and why Facebook executives have been slow to acknowledge the site's role in the 2016 election. “They don’t want to take responsibility for the fact that their platform was used by a malevolent power to create discord in our country," Kara says. She and Katie also delve into tech addiction in kids, the effect of automation on jobs, and their long careers in journalism. Plus, Kara turns the mic around and asks Katie about her time at Yahoo, and what she'd like to do next.</p>]]>

      <title>26. Sheryl Sandberg: Living Option B</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After her husband died suddenly from a cardiac arrhythmia, Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg (Lean In) thought she would never experience true joy again. Nearly two years later, she is out with a new book, Option B, that delves into how she proved herself wrong— and how others can build resilience in the face of trauma, too. Sandberg wrote Option B with her friend Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist and Wharton professor. They both join Katie onstage at 92Y (92Y.org) in Manhattan to discuss insights from the book, including how to support grieving children, dating after loss, and the "three P's" that can hinder recovery.

      <title>22. Stan Greenberg: Presidential Pollster</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Renowned Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg has advised the likes of Bill Clinton, Tony Blair and Nelson Mandela. But he first made a name for himself studying white working class voters. His seminal 1985 report on so-called Reagan Democrats examined why auto workers were abandoning the Democratic Party in Macomb County, Michigan. Greenberg joins Katie and Brian to discuss how the 2016 election gave him déjà vu, why he's been spending time in Macomb again and what he's hearing from Trump supporters there. Plus, a caller in Chicago gets on the line to explain why she went from being a lifelong Democrat to voting for Donald Trump.

      <title>13. Mike Murphy: Rogue Republican</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[GOP strategist Mike Murphy caught the political bug early: he began his career as a college student making radio ads out of his dorm room for a long-shot congressional race. He's gone on to specialize in winning statewide campaigns for governor and Senate. He's been the lead strategist for many major Republican figures, including John McCain, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mitt Romney. He also had a role in the 2016 campaign season. "I ran the Jeb Bush super PAC," he explains, "which gives me the unique credential of having blown, oh, over 95 million dollars and not winning." Mike joins Katie and Brian to discuss his vocal criticism of Donald Trump, the media's role in modern politics and why he's a hopeless romantic when it comes to presidential races.This episode is brought to you by Sock Club, Aspen Ideas to Go podcast, Hello Fresh, and Omaha Steaks.]]>
