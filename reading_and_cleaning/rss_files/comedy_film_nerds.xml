			<description><![CDATA[<p>*FILMS DISCUSSED: DARKEST HOUR, BATTLE OF THE SEXES, THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX, SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FALLOUT* Chirs, Graham and Aaron talk about how Darkest Hour is a good companion piece to Dunkirk. Graham liked watching Battle of The Sexes on a Plane. Chris wants Netflix to stop making bad films like Cloverfield Paradox. Solo trailer looks good and everyone is as excited about new Mission Impossible as Aaron is. It's the Ras Al Ghoul of episodes. </p>]]></description>

Sandberg, into the ATC studio. Chris expectations of Transformers were very low and still not met. Graham is glad woman can now make lame comedies like men have. David liked the visuals of The Bad Batch. Chris was happy with the simplicity of Paterson. Graham still isn't sure about Beatriz at Dinner. David talks about the making of Annabelle. This  episode is like a Battle of The Sexes for films! </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>*FILMS DISCUSSED: THE CIRCLE, BOSS BABY, SANDY WEXLER, 47 METERS DOWN, ONCE UPON A TIME IN VENICE* Chris and Graham welcome first time guest Steve Byrne into ATC Studios! Graham was not a fan of The Circle. Steve and his kid loved Boss Baby. Chris needed 3 days to watch Sandy Wexler. 47 Meters down is either a great wink at shark terror films or a disaster. Once Upon A Time In Venice might be suffering from bad trailer disease. Some good films out on DVD if you missed them. Even Chuck is going to see Guardians of The Galaxy 2 this weekend! This episode is really America's Julia Roberts. </p>]]></description>

Troy didn't like Colossal until the end. Everyone is pumped for some Last Jedi. Detroit appears to be another solid film from Kathryn Bigelow. Punching Henry rounds out a good DVD list which makes the awful new releases not sting so much. This episode will have you realize that it's all about family...14 times. </p>]]></description>
