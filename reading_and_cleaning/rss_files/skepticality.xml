		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We're tired of pertinent social and science news being buried by clap trap. Our podcast is here to bring you relevant, under reported current events, as well as in-depth discussions from a scientific, critical, skeptical, and humorous point of view.

Derek and Swoopy are your hosts, filling your pod and your brain with skeptical insight and conversation, sometimes heated, on a plethora of topics that are ripe for critical examination. Bringing truth to podcasting, and all who choose to listen.

In our travels we will tackle the beasts of pseudoscience; the paranormal, supernatural, ufo / alien encounters, mis-understood history, and overwrought legends - urban or otherwise.

Our interview shows feature notable skeptics including; leading astronomy speakers, scientists, philosophy experts, and other scientific, secular, humanist, and skeptical book authors, and critical thinkers.]]></itunes:summary>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>With The Amazing Meeting ending only a couple days ago, Derek doesn't wait to give you the first recorded interview from the event. Derek talks with Jim Baggott, author of many books on the nature of reality and physics. His latest work, "Farewell to Reality: How Modern Physics Has Betrayed the Search for Scientific Truth". Baggott argues that there is no observational or experimental evidence for many of the ideas of modern theoretical physics: super-symmetric particles,super strings, the multiverse, the holographic principle,or the anthropic cosmological principle. These theories are not only untrue, it is not even science. It is fairy-tale physics: fantastical, bizarre and often outrageous, perhaps even confidence-trickery.</p>]]></description>

Julien is an associate professor of cognitive psychology and psycholinguistics and Rutgers University and the author of the book "The Soul Fallacy: What Science Shows We Gain from Letting Go of Our Soul Beliefs". In this episode Julien describes why he argues that the existence of the soul is a testable hypothesis Ð one thatÕs failed time and time again to hold up against the weight of scientific evidence. And, despite these findings, why he and everyone else should not be sad, or depressed by this fact, but to embrace it and lead a happier and more productive life.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week Derek talks with Gary Kaskel, film maker turned animal protection advocate. Gary's latest book, "Monsters and Miracles: Henry Bergh's America", is a biographical look into Henry Bergh, a man who founded two social justice organizations directly after the United States Civil War. Almost everyone has heard of the ASPCA and about the same number of people also believe that children should be protected and have the right not to be treated as property. However, what most people don't know is that both of those things were pushed up to the forefront of public understanding due to one man, Henry Bergh. Find out more about the man who can be easily called 'The most famous American you've never heard of'.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week Derek speaks with Raphael Lataster, a secular PhD researcher in religious studies who focuses on philosophy of religion, Christian origins, logic, Bayesian reasoning, and the social impacts of atheism. His Master's thesis dealt with Jesus mythicism, concluding that historical and Bayesian reasoning justifies a skeptical position in regards to any form of 'historical Jesus'. His work led him to write his new book, 'There Was No Jesus, There Is No God'. Derek decided to sit down and talk with Raphael and find out more about how the ideas contained in the book came about and how they fit when so many prominent, modern, religious scholars tend to keep making statements as to the historical certainty of a Jesus figure.</p>]]></description>

In 1979 a group of Iranian students invaded and occupied the US Embassy in Tehran. The United States military decided the best way to try to deal with the event was to use a group of newly 'trained' psychics using remote viewing to determine what was going on within the walls of the embassy.

Derek's latest guest, Heather Dewey Hagborg, is an artist who had a massive curiosity about just how much of our personal information we leave behind in the form of DNA evidence. Heather went on a personal mission to find out if she could artistically replicate portraits of people from the DNA they leave behind everywhere you go.</p>]]></description>

Past Skepticality guest, Randy Olson, has spent his time working on ways to help people to understand and communicate information to a broad audience. Teaming with actors Dorie Barton and Brian Palermo, he has formed a well-proven storytelling methodology, which anyone can learn to use, to engage an audience and help people better understand complex information. In this episode of Skepticality, Derek sits down with Randy, Brian and Dorie to discuss their work, its origins, and how anyone can learn to become a better storyteller.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week on Skepticality, Derek has a discussion with Geoffrey “Thor” Desmoulin, a Biomedical Engineer from Vancouver, Canada. Geoffrey works in accident reconstruction and medical device testing. Most people, however, know him best from his well-loved Spike TV show Deadliest Warrior. Using scientific testing and a bit of investigation, the show featured highly detailed dramatizations of historical combat scenarios to find answers to questions like: ‘Who would win in a toe to toe fight, a Ninja or a Spartan?’ It’s kind of like Mythbusters, but more dangerous.</p>]]></description>

Montgomery about how his work led him to write his latest book The Rocks Don't Lie: A Geologist Investigates Noah's Flood. The book is thoughtful and readable, and attempts to respect both young Earth creationist views and the world of evidence-based geological science. According to the books publisher, with an explorers eye and a refreshing approach to both faith and science, Montgomery takes readers on a journey across landscapes and cultures. In the process we discover the illusive nature of truth, whether viewed through the lens of science or religion, and how it changed through history and continues changing, even today.</p>]]></description>

While most were hearing, or watching the news coming out of California, not many heard there were other, connected, suicides which happened in cities around the country. This week Derek has a chat with Deborah Simpson, the sister of one of the Heavens Gate group, Jimmy, who was living in Atlanta, GA at the time. In his farewell letter he wrote, "It's past time for me to</p>

<p>This week Derek sits with Deb Simpson, author of the new book, "Closing The Gate", a deeply personal book about her brother, and the story about how he got involved with such a destructive, and manipulative group.

Dr. Pete is also a popular stand up comedian who performs science, and rational based comedy at events around the United States.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>In September of 2008 Ben Radford appeared as a guest on the podcast Skeptiko, hosted by Alex Tsakiris.  During that interview he agreed to take up Alex's challenge to investigate the best case of the efficacy of psychic detectives.  What followed was months of research, numerous interviews and a follow-up which ended in acrimony.  Now, three years after the initial challenge, the hosts of MonsterTalk (Blake Smith, Ben Radford and Karen Stollznow) have Alex onto their show to discuss Skeptiko, the interface of skeptics and believers, and to settle the matter of whether or not Ben's investigation disproved the psychic's claims. </p>]]></description>

<p>"Skepticism is the agent of reason against organized irrationalism - and is therefore one of the keys to human social and civic decency." - Stephen Jay Gould </p>
<p>Of the scientists who have left their mark on science, skepticism and indeed the Skeptic's Society, few are more quotable or thought-provoking than the late evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. This week on <em>Skepticality</em>, Swoopy talks with Richard York, co-author (with Brett Clark) of <em>The Science and Humanism of Stephen Jay Gould</em>. This new book offers a unique look at Gould not only as a paleontologist and evolutionary theorist, but also as a humanist and one of the most prolific science historians of our time.</p>

<p>Skeptics are all too aware of the irrationality of human nature and society, and turn to critical thinking to live more happily. But could there be benefits from the commonplace irrationalities of everyday life? Cognitive psychologist and behavioral economist Dan Ariely argues that there are.</p>
<p>This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Professor Ariely (author of the New York Times bestseller <em>Predictably Irrational</em>) about his latest book, <em>The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home</em>. Find out how experiments illuminate the unexpected roles of irrational decision-making in daily life, and in shaping the world around us.</p>

<p>This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Dr. Stephen L. Macknik and Dr. Susana Martinez-Conde, co-authors of <em>Sleights of Mind: What the Neuroscience of Magic Reveals About Our Everyday Deceptions</em> (with Sandra Blakeslee).

Her new book <em>Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void</em> explores how space programs, scientists and astronauts (and even astro-chimps) tackle the unexpected complexity of performing everyday activities when in space. <br /> <br /> As with her previous books <em>Spook</em> (the science of the search for the afterlife), <em>Stiff</em></span></span> <span style="font-family: Verdana, Helvetica, Arial;">(the science of the dead), and <em>Bonk</em> (the science of sex), Ms. Roach's accessible investigation into the science of space travel sparkles with humor and insight.</span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<font face="Verdana, Helvetica, Arial"><span style="font-size:12.0px">This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with geneticist Dr. George C. Cunningham, author of <i>Decoding the Language of God: Can a Scientist Really Be a Believer?</i> This book serves as a point-by-point rebuttal of the 2006 bestseller The <i>Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief</i>, by Dr. Francis S. Collins. <br>
<br>
Dr. Collins was the head of the Human Genome Project during its final phases, presiding over one of the greatest scientific achievements of all time. And yet, some skeptics expressed unease about Dr. Collins' 2009 appointment as the Director of the National Institutes of Health. At issue were the award-winning geneticist's beliefs that our "genetic code is, after all, God’s instruction book" — and that God himself does not need an explanation since he is beyond the universe.<br>
<br>
In this interview, Dr. Cunningham respectfully questions the proof Dr. Collins offers for his beliefs, including the Bible and the writings of C.S. Lewis. Additionally, <i>Decoding the Language of God</i> serves as a primer for good critical thinking, discussing points of conflict between naturalistic explanations of reality (which are anchored in scientific research) and supernatural interpretations (which are not). Cunningham's well-reasoned discussion will appeal to people across a wide spectrum of belief and unbelief.</span></font>

She is among skepticism's most influential pioneers — and yet, she has rarely stepped into the public spotlight.

Among Pat's many groundbreaking innovations was the creation of Junior Skeptic (the 10-page kids' critical thinking insert bound within Skeptic magazine). Joining Pat in this interview is current Junior Skeptic editor and illustrator Daniel Loxton, here to talk about their latest creation: a full-color children's book released this week by Kids Can Press, entitled "Evolution: How We and All Living Things Came to Be".]]></description>

This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with his sister Lois Schadewald, who compiled and published a humorous, insightful volume of her brother's articles, essays and interviews in 2008. 

Entitled Worlds of Their Own: A Brief History of Misguided Ideas; Creationism, Flat-Earthism, Energy Scams, and the Velikovsky Affair, Robert Schadewald's work reminds us that in order to understand the difference between science and pseudoscience we must investigate the unique claims and personalities of some of history's most unorthodox thinkers. Only then can we begin to learn what leads some people to embrace critical thinking and science — and others cling to their own realities despite all the evidence in the universe….]]></description>

This week on Skepticality Swoopy talks with Jon Ronson about his experiences bonding with skeptics at the recent Amazing Meeting London, his bizarre cruise (and rare interview) with psychic Sylvia Browne, and his 2004 auto-biographical book The Men Who Stare at Goats which will be released this November as a feature film starring Ewan McGregor and George Clooney.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[On this week's Skepticality, Derek and Swoopy have just returned from
Charlotte PopFest, a unique music festival with proceeds benefitting
the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Unexpected
local media backlash against the PopFest benefitting a group of
"evolutionists" is further evidence why events like this one, the
first of it's kind, are so important.

These sentiments are echoed in this week's short interviews with
PopFest musician Jill Sobule, members of the Charlotte Atheists and
Agnostics and Keith Williams, a local Charlotte skeptic who wrote a
letter to WBTV Charlotte to express his concern over their reporting
of the PopFest as an example of "Science and religion butting heads".]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[On April 20, 1999, two boys left an indelible stamp on American society when they carried out their plan to kill as many of their high school classmates as they could. The very word "Columbine" has come to represent a specific brand of unthinkable horror: when children make a calculated decision to murder their teachers and peers.

In the chaos and aftermath of that April day, legends and misinformation quickly proliferated. A great deal of what was reported about Columbine was simply not true. 

Author Dave Cullen has spent the last ten years of his journalistic career studying the lives of the residents of Littleton Colorado as they were before, during, and after this shattering event. Cullen's seminal book on the subject, Columbine, delves deep into the psyches of the killers, the victims, and their families — to set the record straight not only about what really happened on that fateful day, but why.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What can regular skeptics actually do to enhance the appreciation of science and skeptical inquiry?
 
This question has been an ongoing theme for Skepticality, and this week's guest has one answer to propose. In his audio essay, "Raising Our Game: The Rationale to Embrace Skepticamp," software architect Reed Esau argues that "Skepticamps" (self-organizing peer conferences of intimate scale) can harness the potential of the "long tail" of the skeptical movement — offering a voice to all of us who have passion and expertise to share but who cannot take on the role of a "professional" skeptic. 
 
These meetings are an experiment in the structure of a movement, and they are capturing the imagination of many new skeptics. What are the true implications for skeptical organizing? Is the advent of social networking technologies really the moment when everything changed?

Also Tim Farley of Whatstheharm.net talks with Swoopy about an effort to help out a fellow Skeptical activist in need.]]></description>

In his audio essay, "Raising Our Game: The Rationale to Embrace Skepticamp," software architect Reed Esau argues that "Skepticamps" (self-organizing peer conferences of intimate scale) can harness the potential of the "long tail" of the skeptical movement — offering a voice to all of us who have passion and expertise to share but who cannot take on the role of a "professional" skeptic. 
 
These meetings are an experiment in the structure of a movement, and they are capturing the imagination of many new skeptics. What are the true implications for skeptical organizing? Is the advent of social networking technologies really the moment when everything changed?

Also Tim Farley of Whatstheharm.net talks with Swoopy about an effort to help out a fellow Skeptical activist in need.]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with Skeptic magazine's resident expert critic of alternative medicine, "SkepDoc" Dr. Harriet Hall. Dr. Hall talks about about her recent memoir Women Aren't Supposed to Fly, which details her life as a family practice specialist, flight surgeon, pilot, and career Air Force officer.

			<title>Skepticality #078 - What the Fossils Say, and Why it Matters - Interview: Dr. Donald R. Prothero</title>

			<description><![CDATA[Just this week, the discovery of the 300-million year old Gerobatrachus hottoni ("Hotton's elder frog") confirmed the previously contentious inference that modern frogs and salamanders evolved from one group of ancient primitive amphibians. The dispute arose because of a lack of transitional forms; but, like so many "missing links," this newly discovered fossil sealed the gap.
 
The fossil record is one of the strongest lines of evidence for evolution, yet it continues to come under attack by present-day creationists and advocates of Intelligent Design.  This week on Skepticality, Swoopy talks with eminent paleontologist and professor of geology Donald R. Prothero about his bestselling Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why it Matters. This comprehensive book explores not only the rich mosaic of fossil discoveries and transitional forms, but also the very nature of science—and the "monkey business of creationism."]]></description>

Dr. Olson strives to improve the reputation of science in the court of public opinion, where the Religious Right and Intelligent Design movements continue to wedge their way in by "teaching the controversy."  On his "Shifting Baselines" blog, Dr. Olson was one of the first scientists to express concern that the well-funded Expelled was likely to succeed in selling its message to a tremendous number of people. The "dodos" of the blogosphere responded with incredulity.

Slavko Halatyn (known to his many fans as simply "Slau") has enjoyed a rich career as both a music producer and award-winning recording artist.  Derek talks with Slau about his work with other artists (like skeptical favorite George Hrab), being an early adopter of podsafe music — and the links between his career, his world view, and his becoming legally blind at the age of 21.

Author Scott Sigler sent a shot across the bow of mainstream publishing when, after first giving away his novel Ancestor for free as a PDF, the printed retail version then broke the Amazon.com top 10.  As a result, Scott earned himself a seat at the table and a deal with Crown books.  We talk to Scott about his new novel Infected — released on April 1st and already a bestseller.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This week Skepticality features Michael Adelson, a staff conductor for the New York Philharmonic, and conductor of the Auros Group for New Music in Boston.

Mr. Adelson had the good fortune to study with the late Rabbi Sherwin Wine. Rabbi Wine founded Humanistic Judaism, a secular movement which provides atheistic and ignostic Jews around the world with a means for organization, mobilization, and a sense of community.

Speaking to Swoopy as a skeptic, Mr. Adelson shares insights from his lecture series, the “Forum for New Thinking‿ (inspired by Rabbi Wine). He also takes a critical look at music history, dispelling some false beliefs about artists — creative humans who are often painted with the brush of divine inspiration.

Building on the musical theme, Swoopy talks to Canadian blue grass trio The Dirty Dishes about their new rendition of “Lily The Pink‿, an ode to the late 1800’s “queen‿ of patent medicine Lydia Pinkham.]]></description>

A far cry from most books that offer up a secret message, A Secret of the Universe is a work of dramatic allegory about how we come to form knowledge about the Big Questions: God, sexual ethics, morals, political ideology—and how those beliefs affect our actions, our lives, and the world around us.

			<description><![CDATA[Recent episodes of Skepticality have touched on issues of outreach and activism in the skeptical community, and how skeptics like Jeff Wagg, Alison Smith and Daniel Loxton are using their particular talents to help nurture science and critical thinking.

This week, Derek and Swoopy are pleased to continue this trend with their interview of evolutionary ecologist-turned-filmmaker Dr. Randy Olson. 

Dr. Olson's film, Flock of Dodos: The Evolution - Intelligent Design Circus, is not your typical evolution versus ID documentary. Rather than simply pitting one camp against the other, this whimsical film explores how the two sides of the debate market their ideas to the public—and, more specifically, how the scientific community has failed to capture their audience as effectively as the Intelligent Design camp has done in recent years.]]></description>

This week, Daniel Loxton (editor of Junior Skeptic) offers his own personal perspective on the future of skepticism as a movement. Presented as an original full-length audio article his op-ed essay argues that the search for a "new skepticism" is misguided—and that the early titans of skepticism had it right in the first place. 

Then, Derek and Swoopy sit down with Daniel to talk about the skeptics paradox: that so many people feel exhausted and fed up by the paranormal, at the very time that the most exciting new developments—from podcasts to conferences to community—are firmly focused on our core paranormal concerns. 

Has classic skepticism run its course? According to Daniel, we're only now getting ready to start.]]></description>

Wealthy nations like the United States have some of the cleanest, cheapest and best tasting tap water in the world.  The US is also the world's largest consumer of bottled water: 8.3 billion gallons in 2006 (about 26 gallons per person)! Will our rising demand for  bottled water harm our nation's aging water distribution and filtration infrastructure?  And why are groups like Presbyterians for Restoring Creation boycotting bottled water?

Wealthy nations like the United States have some of the cleanest, cheapest and best tasting tap water in the world.  The US is also the world's largest consumer of bottled water: 8.3 billion gallons in 2006 (about 26 gallons per person)! Will our rising demand for  bottled water harm our nation's aging water distribution and filtration infrastructure?  And why are groups like Presbyterians for Restoring Creation boycotting bottled water?

Most relevant to skeptics, the gang discusses Brian's recent involvement in a lawsuit against Uri Geller, who recently pressured online video host YouTube to remove a James Randi Nova expose regarding his spoon-bending psychic claims.

Comfort and Cameron claimed that they could prove scientifically, without invoking the Bible or faith, that their god exists. Disappointingly the program that aired (after much editing) ran more like The Debate that Wasn't.

Instead of letting the nonsense get to us, we called upon voices of reason and great debaters Dr. Michael Shermer and Dr. Phil Plait to cheer us up, and help make sense of it all.]]></description>
