      <title>Ep. 168 – David Nichtern: Awakening from the Daydream</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu is joined once again by musician, author, and teacher, David Nichtern. David chats with Raghu about his new book, “Awakening from the Daydream,” which reimagines the ancient Buddhist parables of the Wheel of Life and Samsara. David describes a few of the realms of Samsara and where we see them playing out in our world today. He also gives us practices to overcome these obstacles to our inner balance. This conversation about Buddhism is not one to be missed. Everyone can learn something, as David relates the teachings of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche in a way that is accessible to anyone. “In each of these realms, the peace that you are talking about has been mistaken. You think the peace is, ‘ If I keep competing and keep getting to the top, then I will have peace.’ In The Hungry Ghost realm,’ If I keep consuming if I keep craving things that act will bring me peace.’ But it is exactly that act which keeps you from having peace.” – David Nichtern,Awakening from the Daydream: Reimagining the Buddha’s Wheel of Life   More About David David Nichtern is a senior teacher in the Shambhala Buddhist lineage of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche. This tradition combines a contemporary, secular approach to meditation with the ancient practices and philosophies of Tibetan Buddhism. David was one of the initial American students of renowned meditation master Trungpa Rinpoche and studied closely with him soon after his arrival in the United States in 1970. David has been co-director of the LA Shambhala Center and Karme Choling Meditation Center in Vermont, as well as Director of Expansion for Shambhala Training International and Director of Buddhist Practice and Study for OM yoga. He has been a featured writer and regular contributor to The Huffington Post and leads meditation workshops around the world and online. David also works individually with meditation students in person and via Skype. He does a weekly live broadcast on Ustream (via his Facebook page) and has several online meditation workshops available through creativeLIVE.com. His DVD/CD package OM YOGA & MEDITATION WORKSHOP, created in conjunction with yoga teacher Cyndi Lee, is widely available David Nichtern is also a well-known composer, producer and guitarist – a four-time Emmy winner and a two-time Grammy nominee. He is the founder of Dharma Moon and 5 Points Records. David has recorded and played with Stevie Wonder, Jerry Garcia, Lana Del Rey, Maria Muldaur, Paul Simon and many others. Among his many credits in records, film and tv, David wrote the classic song “Midnight at the Oasis” and composed the score for Christopher Guest’s film “The Big Picture”. As the Beyman Bros, he collaborated with Guest and CJ Vanston on an album “Memories of Summer as a Child” and has produced multiple records for Grammy nominated kirtan performer Krishna Das.

      <title>Ep. 165 - Empathy with Judith Orloff</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[An old friend of the show, Dr. Judith Orloff, returns to have a conversation with Raghu about empathy and sensitivity. We are given a compelling look at the life of an empath and how one might stay spiritually open while protecting themselves from being overwhelmed by what they let in. Judith is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at UCLA, practicing Psychiatrist, and best-selling New York Times author. Her unique approach marries traditional psychiatric practices, intuition, spirituality, and energy medicine, unlike any other practitioner. "People who are sensitive in life may suffer much more than those who are insensitive. But, if they understand and go beyond their suffering, they will discover extraordinary things." - Jiddu Krishnamurti]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Our podcast guru, Duncan Trussell, introduces Raghu to writer and producer Dan Harmon. Dan is known for his cutting humor and honest introspection. Our trio sits down in Dan’s studio for a conversation about work, introspection, and finding happiness.Coming from a background of not making enough money and working undesirable jobs, Dan tries to find balance with his life and workload now that everyone wants to hire him for something.  Dan shares his recent struggle of being aware of, and respecting, the feelings and experience of his employees. The group discusses mindfulness and being aware of the destructive patterns that play out in our lives. Tune in for all this and more on this week’s unique episode of the Mindrolling Podcast with Dan Harmon!Show Notes07:30 – Dan talks a bit about his relationship with work and his “workaholism”. It can be hard to turn away any creative work away when you remember what it’s like not having any. 12:30 – The group discusses the idea of mindfulness and finding satisfaction in even the most menial of tasks. There is fulfillment in being present and at one with our work. Dan reminisces about an impactful conversation with a very honest telemarketer about her place in life.17:05 – Dan romanticizes a future where every person has moral dealbreakers on how they spend their time. In an economy where most are forced into sacrificing more of themselves than they may wish, what would the world look like under different circumstances?19:40 – Duncan accidentally uncovers the anarchist roots of Twitter.21:05 – Raghu talks to Dan more about “workaholism”. Dan is currently working on how his “workaholism” is affecting the people who work for him. He is especially sensitive to his actions because of how much abuse workers in the entertainment industry receive already.26:30 – Duncan expresses what it is like being caught in the machine that is corporate entertainment. How does one acknowledge and respect every individual involved in such a high-intensity position?30:05 – Raghu points out that the first step in approaching the issue of fully recognizing others in the moment is having the intention to make that person a priority.  Dan opens up about his difficulty being mindful of this dilemma.35:40 – We go around everyday projecting what others are thinking and allowing them to influence how we interact with the world. This is why the mindfulness movement is gaining so much popularity. Allowing us to understand what is really going on in our mind and what motivates us. Duncan and Dan share where they are at in their lives on the subject of mindfulness.38:50 – There are these recursive videotapes of habit that we run throughout our lives. Duncan exposes about how uneasy he feels thinking about this concept of the replaying tapes, and the work it takes to break the loop they catch us in.45:30 – Dan has difficulty in putting his finger on what exactly he wants, is that a sign that he may already have it? Duncan relates Dan’s dilemma to Buddhist and Bhakti teachings.50:15 – Forget trying to reach Nirvana while we are still asking, “why am I not happy?” We need to focus on simple steps, looking inside is the first step on that path to happiness. Raghu explains Jack Kornfield’s question of “How do we make friends with suffering?”55:35 – Dan Harmon is known for talking about truth no matter how uncomfortable it may be. He shares his view of truth as a life-saving mechanism. It is difficult for Dan to see the duplicity in so much of our modern world, which fuels his pursuit of honesty and truth.1:00:20 – When we remain blind to our self-centeredness we create deeper layers of complexity to our suffering. Duncan relates Dan’s position to Copernicus’s theory of Heliocentrism. Dan expresses his difficulty in separating himself from the “I”.  Raghu reminds us that we all are going through the same trip and explains how his practice has changed the way he navigates life.Dan Harmon is a writer, show runner, and producer.

Usher into reality the possibility of a world village glued together by a concert of wisdom.” – Malidoma Somé   John Lockley is a fully initiated sangoma (healer and shaman) in the Xhosa lineage of South Africa, having spent 10 years in an apprenticeship with the tribe that gave us Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. His remarkable journey through the constraints of Apartheid is a testament to the human spirit, and to the power of forgiveness and reconciliation.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mindfulness and approaching it from as many practical approaches as possible. In this latest episode, Raghu and Ramesh look at: What does mindfulness really mean? What kind of perspective you can have about it that can change your life, the different practices of it that people can do on a day to day basis without joining anything, you can sit there and work with your breath, so you can bring awareness and the witness into your life so you can see your motivations and have a curiosity on who you really are. Bringing mindfulness into your life so you can just relax into a moment where you’re not judging yourself and can just be. In a world that asks us to be constantly multi-tasking, how do we curb the monkey mind? Ramesh and Raghu explore a variety of practices and perspectives that help to cultivate a less discursive mind. Such as the breath, which brings all your life systems to one place and is critical to focusing. Or Vipassana, also known as Insight Meditation, is a meditation that helps develop concentration and facilitates having clear focus, or one-pointedness. Whatever the practice, it’s about settling the mind and body down, so that one’s consciousness can come together.

      <title>Ep 158 - Caravan of No Despair- Mirabai Starr</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu welcomes Mirabai Starr- famous for her Christian Mystic books and now her memoir- Caravan of No Despair. Raghu asked what in the world she asked for while still in the Bardos between lives - her first few decades in this incarnation being so full of intense suffering! As if she knew what she needed to transform her being but she really asked for the full monty and managed to come through with flying colors! At one point Mirabai talks about how she "fired" God- "...all the teachings I had once embraced I now dismissed as artifacts of magical thinking." Of course this led to our discussion of the dark night of the soul and St John of the Cross whose book she then translated. And in the midst of that work she had a realization. "Tragedy and trauma are not guarantees for a transformational spiritual experience, true, but they are opportunities." Mirabai also explains two key concepts- Radical Unknowingness and Sacred Unraveling. These two form the backbone of a spiritual path that is not pre-digested concepts but more visceral reality.

      <title>Ep. 157 - Trevor Hall and Mother Kali</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu and his Guru pal Duncan Trussell, get together for an illuminating conversation with Trevor Hall at the most recent Ram Dass retreat on Maui. Trevor shares his amazing transformation through discovering the guru, Neem Karoli Baba, by meeting Raghu’s younger brother at the age of 17, and eventually winding up living in a Kali temple in Laguna Beach, CA. Duncan’s infectious curiosity anchors this podcast as Trevor describes the many layers of symbolism found in the image of the fierce goddess Kali. Most people don’t see the significance behind the many layers of this Goddess, usually getting distracted by the gore depicted and not seeing the undertones of motherly unconditional love represented. Trevor draws from his years living at the Kali temple to explain the iconography and the unconditional love behind the Divine Mother Goddess Kali. Duncan’s questions serve as a guide as Trevor elaborates on all facets of the portrayals of Kali: from the reason Kali is seen biting her tongue, to the implications of her holding the sword of discernment in one hand, and a severed head in the other. In the case of Kali’s bloody garland of 50 skulls, Trevor helps to break down the symbolism: “the 50 heads represent the 50 letters of the sanskrit alphabet, which includes all sound. All sounds come from the mother, everything we hear: good, bad, the sound of the ocean, this language, everything is filled with the mother’s presence. So what happens if we have that mindset, everything I hear is just ma, ma, ma…” Or as Duncan summarizes it: “So everything I hear is a severed head on the neck of Kali.” Raghu recounts his experiences with different embodiments of the Divine Mother: with reading the “Gospel of Ramakrishna”; a meeting with Sri Aurobindo’s spiritual partner, “Mother” in Pondicherry; and his interactions with his Indian mother, the saint, Siddhi Ma. Together, they continue to explore their own personal experiences with Divine Mother, their mothers, and the spectrum of both positive and negative attachments Western culture has with the word “Mother.” To wrap up, Trevor chants a prayer to the Divine Mother, or Ma. ]]>

      <title>Ep.156 - Think Less is More</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu is joined by his roommate from back in the day in India, Rameshwar Das Lytton or just plain Ramesh! Ramesh has been Ram Dass co-author on his two latest books- Be Love Now and Polishing The Mirror. Raghu quotes from Ram Dass about those who saw the physical Guru- “None of us knew Maharaji- we just knew our own projections” More fodder for the reality of not needing to meet the Guru in the flesh. Also on the table is; what is a Guru vs a Saint vs a Siddha or perfectly enlightened one. Raghu and Ramesh also delve into the reality of our overactive, busy minds and the effect on our lives. Referring from a NY Times article that corroborated scientifically that “the capacity for original thinking is markedly stymied by stray thoughts, obsessive ruminations and other forms of mental load” and “your internal exploration is too often diminished by an overly occupied mind”. So our only conclusion is Meditate Now!]]>

      <title>Ep. 155 - Failure Free Zone with Gil Fronsdal</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu with his co-host, true blue soul mate wife, Saraswati Markus hang with Gil Fronsdal- newly named Baba Gil. Gil hails from the Insight Meditation family and was discovered by Saraswati during her long nite festivals of Dharama talks. When we talk about the difficulties people have with meditative practice Gil calls out to people to remember that it is a "failure free zone". We talk about the Be Here Now concept and Gil renames it "unconditional acceptance of the present moment". And of course the hosts inevitably have to ask about mindfulness and it's very worldly application in these times- Gil suggests that we use mindfulness to check out our thoughts and motivations and follow and be aware of where our focus wanders. Saraswati engages Baba Gil about the Buddhist No Self teaching which he comments on as " the self is like wind drag- when you eliminate that drag you can become free- no self".    Gil Fronsdal- The Issue At Hand- Essays on Mindfulness http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org   Amazon recommendations;  Radiohead- A Moon Shaped Pool  When Anger Hurts Matthew Mckay]]>

Unfortunately, just before the session Raghu cut someone off in the bathroom line and then was reprimanded by the aggrieved party. Of course there ensued guilt and recrimination which Duncan, in his wisdom, reassured Raghu that we all can't live up to impossible standards all the time- he then drifted into some comparison to the crucifixion.... Lama Surya Das on the other hand came to the table with exemplary explanations of the very difficult Buddhist concept of emptiness in his inimitable practical teaching style.

      <title>Ep. 153 - Polarization</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu chats with Danny Goldberg- a man well versed in culture and politics to discuss the intense polarization in this country in this election year. The discussion circles around an article by Arthur C Brooks entitled Bipartisanship isn’t for Wimps, After All. Even friends are polarized by loyalties to Hillary or Bernie not to mention between Democrats and Republicans. As Mr Brooks mentions in his article- “we don’t like each other very much” and bigotry reigns all the way to contempt. How do we deal with this in our lives and stop the individual tendencies towards this polarization in our society. The Dalai Lama suggests the anti-dotes. Of course looking to ourselves and our behavior and not to governments and institutions to make the necessary changes. The Dalai Lama goes further to suggest a cultivation of warm heartedness towards those with whom we disagree. Sound squishy? No it’s actually tough but practical advice. As Danny says though- I don’t think it’s a contradiction of warm heartedness to say to those you disagree with- I respect your pain, I can love your soul but there are some moral issues that you advocate that I cannot agree with and I will counter in every way that I can. And Danny tells of ride sharing with a Trump supporter that featured two warm hearts!]]>

      <title>Ep. 151 - New Beliefs, New Brain with Lisa Wimberger</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu introduces Lisa Wimberger, who got hit by lightening, blacked out and lost her pulse at 15 years old! Her traumatic event let Lisa to a new path, developing Neurosculpting - a fusion of brain science and mindfulness.
As she says, even the most insidious mental beliefs can be re-written- and boy could we all use a little brain re-wiring!
Lisa and Raghu talk about the flight-fright-freeze survival response and how it takes over our lives and how to protect ourselves from “contagious” emotions.
Also Raghu delights in an article Lisa wrote on the New Age Scourge - she says, “ First stop saying Namaste and bless you when what you really mean is screw you.”
This leads us to a conversation about clearing out toxic beliefs and behavior patterns.
This podcast will change our tune with its mind-altering insights!]]>

      <title>Ep. 150 - Dream Yoga</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu and guest host Michael "Jadu" Daner chats with dream yoga teacher Michael Katz, co-author of an excellent book, "Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light".  
Jadu tells his earliest fearful dream experiences that turned into euphoric flying dreams - and how flying in dreams presages lucid dreaming.
Michael talks about how the mastering of lucidity in the dream state eventually will help master our final transition through the bardos or states of consciousness we enter into when we die.In dream yoga the emphasis is on the possibility of some level of enlightenment experience at the time of final transition.
Michael Katz introduces his teacher, Lama Namkai Norbu (co-author of Dream Yoga) who said once, "I never claimed to be enlightened but I am a really good dream yogi." He is said to be able to return to specific dreams every night!
"Rather than seeing dreams as messages from the psyche the Dzogchen tradition (Liberating Awareness) views them as an opportunity to recognize and interact with the foundations of your life."]]>

      <title>Ep. 149 - Koshin Paley Ellison's Contemplative Care</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu speaks with Koshin Paley Ellison, the founder and partner of the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care, an organization that works closely with people who are passing or ill. Koshin Paley describes his origins and how he was introduced to Zen Buddhism. He talks about the teachers, influences and triggers which geared the direction of his life and practice.  Including; the Aids Epidemic of the 1980’s, Alan Ginsberg, and his first Zen teacher John Daido Loori as well as being exposed to Ram Dass as a very young person.
Koshin Paley tells the moving story of the passing away of his grandmother and the tremendous impact that experience had on his life. (hint: The New York Center for Contemplative Care wouldn’t be here otherwise!)
Raghu and Koshin discuss the blending of Jungian depth techniques with Buddhist psychology and what exactly a Spiritual Bypass is.
Other topics covered are relationships, bearing witness, loving action and what is being brought to light by working with dying people.  ]]>

      <title>Ep. 148 - Rick Doblin's Psychedelic Studies</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu is joined by Rick Doblin, head of (take a deep breath for this one) Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, otherwise known as MAPS!
Rick describes some of the things that helped him to see into a new reality, including his faith-puncturing Bar Mitzvah, which forced him out of what would have been a “manufactured” mystical connection.
Rick then goes on to describe his introduction to LSD in college, and how he discovered a new way of processing information and consciousness from those experiences; it opened him up to the emotional world.
Other topics discussed include:
- The emotional stability of our culture
-  Using psychedelics for healing and therapy
- Using psychedelics to rail against the “us” and “them” rhetoric present between countries, religions, races and creeds.
-  Doblin’s discovery of the underground psychedelic community
- How LSD opened the “Westerners” up to to a visceral understanding of their time with Neem Karoli Baba (Maharaji) when they traveled to India
- How do the subjects of the “Good Friday” experiment look back on their psychedelic experiences today?
- How does MDMA work?
- What is The Theory of Causal Indifference?
- How can psychedelics help with PTSD and other trauma?

      <title>Ep. 147 - Saraswati Markus and the Yogic Dao</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Saraswati Markus finally makes her debut on Mindrolling! Who else could so exquisitely describe all of the incredible facets of the ancient technology of Yoga (she is Raghu's beloved you know!)
 
At the same time Saraswati shows the synthesis she has created with The Dao, Yoga and Chinese medicine and the potential healing modalities they contain. Not just physical but a true path to untangle the knots that form our habitual patterns.
She expands on that idea by showing how we can all access the innate wisdom of our bodies for healing. 
 
Also there is the concept of healing when you change what you like - Not easy and of course Raghu rebels cause he won't give up his toast and Chai with a lot of sugar!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mindrolling and Raghu have a new best friend! Jake Sasseville of the Jake Sasseville podcast is a unique human who has been in show biz from a very early age.
Jake shares a very traumatic family story which eventually tripped him onto the spiritual path in a very substantial way. Raghu shares Ram Dass' words in respect to Jake's reflections on suffering - "Every moment of your life is your vehicle for awakening".
R&J chat about the tension between taking actions in your life and the reality that everything is already written and we just need to relax and let Grace happen.
Also on the table is a discussion around the seven ways spiritual people bullshit themselves. #1 being the power of positive thinking - Raghu admits to his disdain for the new age model and his subsequent reaction to his own judgmental mind. We always have to remember though that there is more than one motivation for every action we take - why not focus on the positive?]]>

        <![CDATA[Duncan joins Raghu and introduces the concept of Ecstasy Talk- an MDMA allusion to the experience of the Ram Dass retreats. Raghu introduces new End Of The World news which send Duncan into a right wing deep south spiral!
The duo also talks about the statistics that this world is far less violent that at any time in history. Can it be true?
Then there is the idea that our current technology is a new organism that is forming a parasitic relationship with the life form called a human being…. Raghu introduces a story of unconditional love through Pete the dog- and how that introduces humans to love without conditions.
Duncan scares Raghu with his concept of the Jihad- of course we settle on the meaning as inner sacred battle with ego and how that’s reflected in the Bhagavad Gita.
Then there is the concept of gratitude - it can change our world!]]>

Duncan scares Raghu with his concept of the Jihad- of course we settle on the meaning as inner sacred battle with ego and how that’s reflected in the Bhagavad Gita.
Then there is the concept of gratitude - it can change our world!]]>

      <title>Ep. 143 - Time to Stand Up</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu and Thanissara explore her amazing book Time To Stand Up: The Buddha's Life and Message Through Feminine Eyes - it serves as a call to action for the engagement of the feminine Shakti principal to transform our planet in every way.
For instance, our current traditional patriarchal zeitgeist is so slow to speak out in defense of our planet. Patriarchal religions that denigrate women, the body and sexuality tend to not challenge the denigration of the earth.
The feminine is of great importance for our awakening and Thanisarra eloquently presents the case that we must make the feminine central in all of our lives, not solely as gender but as a living dimension within each one of us.
Feminine energy is essential, because of it's natural receptivity, inclusivity and empathy.
Fundamental intelligence is the Mother!]]>

      <title>Ep. 142 - Does it Help to Worry?</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu and George “Balaram” Pitagorsky discuss his recent blog on Shedding Light to Combat ignorance: confrontation is necessary when hate mongers spread their message and embellish it with misinformation. Confrontation, in this context, means speaking up and inserting facts and alternative views. It means shedding light to expose and combat ignorance.
George and Raghu also share the facts about how we worry and when it’s beneficial and when it is certainly not! In a recent NY Times article, worry was reported to be beneficial. Those who worried about an outcome tended to have a less stressful reaction when the worrisome outcome occurred and a greater positive response when things worked out well. Those who did not worry, tended to be devastated when their optimism was proven to be unfounded and just mildly satisfied when things worked out as expected. Raghu disputes both of these premises and confesses to his longstanding ungodly worrywart reality!
On the other side of the issue is the attitude expressed by the Rudolf Abel character in "Bridge of Spies" who when asked "Aren't you worried?" in reference to being convicted and sentenced to death for being a Soviet spy, responds coolly "Would it help?" 
And there is Meher Baba - “Do your best. Then, don't worry, be happy."]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kiley Jon Clark joins Mindrolling and introduces us to his amazing work with the homeless - not only offering them food and love but also teaching meditation practice on the streets and in the shelters.
Kiley tell his transformational story from an addictive cowboy lifestyle to the Buddhist path. He tells the a magical story of meeting his Tibetan teacher Lama Tulku Tsori Dechen Rinpoche who literally went home with him right after they first met and turned his life around.
 
The conversations turns around the cultivation of fearlessness and relating with

all One."
 
Kiley also shares the concept of meditation as "becoming familiar with ourselves" -
Kiley is a true original no BS soul walking the path - and his poetry seems like it was written by the ancients!

        <![CDATA[Raghu has a deep chat with Reggie Ray, one of Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche’s first American students.
Reggie shares some very personal moments with Trungpa Rinpoche that illuminate some of the unique qualities of this amazing being:
“In the beginning, naive me would go down to the picnic tables and see Rinpoche sitting alone and I’d sit down next to him and it was like I had just sat down next to the noon-day sun, and I was terrified of what he might do because in his space somehow whatever your little trip was it was going to be exposed.”

      <title>Ep. 139 - Skepticism, Love and Courage</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu is joined by Pete Holmes, Duncan Trussell and Sharon Salzberg in Maui for a  wonderfully entertaining, humorous and enlightening podcast.
Duncan talks about a euphemism for God and how we are constantly barraged by the word “God” - which triggers something negative inside us that’s been cultivated throughout our lives.
How do we deal with the skepticism and doubt that accompanies a lot of spiritual subjects? Is a good dose of skepticism healthy?
Sharon Salzberg elucidates on some Buddhist teachings around experimenting with skepticism and doubt - in order to truly face the power of the truth that comes from within.
In order to find freedom you have to be able to ask questions and explore the world around you for yourself.
What should we do when we can’t remember what love feels like?
What is real love anyway? And how do we find the courage to cross past our obstacles and suffering?]]>

      <title>Ep. 138 - Animal Wisdom with Dr. Linda Bender</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[David chats with Dr. Linda Bender, an advocate, author and educator in the sacred connection shared by humans, animals and nature.
Dr. Linda talks about the reality of our connection to all animals - the root word of animal is "animus" which means soul.
Dr. Linda says, “When we name and have a relationship with that being - be it a dog or a cat - we recognize that being as an individual - we get to know that individual and that individual becomes special. We are all here together as one and we have a sacred connection to all life.”
David quotes from her book, Animal Wisdom: ”We get to know who we are as human beings when we see the reflection of ourself in the eyes of a being that is not human."
Animals have psychic abilities - things happen that cannot be explained logically.How do fish instantly move and never bump into each other - how does homing in birds work?
Gandhi said, "The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way it's animals are treated."
How are we doing in that department?]]>

Rabbi Rami certainly reflects the Mindroller’s central theme which is Neem Karoli Baba’s edict of “All One” - there is only One emanation of the Divine. 
Rabbi Rami says, “To me, religions are like languages - no language is true or false: all languages are of human origin - each language reflects and shapes the civilization that speaks it. Judaism is my mother tongue, yet in matters of the spirit I strive to be multilingual.” 
He talks about his realizations sitting Zazen and awakening to grace. 
The Mindrollers have a lively back-and-forth with the Rabbi around the idea of the Jewish uniqueness of being at home with paradox. Argument and doubt are central themes of the Jewish mystical tradition.

      <title>Ep. 136 - The Cool Breeze of Compassion</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Lama Tsultrim Allione joins the Mindrollers for a deep chat about our current disturbing world events - how do we as world citizens see how we can help to heal, and how do we get right perspective within ourselves? Part of the path of a Bodhisattva (Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings) is not to turn away - to stay present even if it’s painful - to bear witness.
Lama teaches a breath meditation to offer the cool breeze of compassion.
Compassion and Bodhicitta (Awakened Heart) rise easily in extreme situations as in some of the heroic moments in Paris - and we can train to develop that part of ourselves.
Lama also explains the value and concept of Emptiness - It is freeing when we let go of the solidity of ourselves and the world - it can be magical.
And in the Holiday season do we have more pleasure giving or receiving?]]>

      <title>Ep. 135 - Roshi Joan Halifax &amp; “Negative Capability”</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Roshi expounds on the transformation of doubt, rootlessness, suffering and meaninglessness into a true “refuge of truth.” At this time of the horrific terror events in Paris, Beirut and Mali, how do we come to terms with severe crisis, either individual or societal? How does the Romantic poet John Keats’s “negative capability” fit into this unavoidable, desperately difficult dynamic of living? Roshi explores the moment of the shock of recognition and how it can change us from the depths. Even the Dalai Lama spoke of those moments of extreme doubt and pain, or as Mr. Dylan sang “Even the President of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked…” Roshi’s upcoming book “Standing At the Edge” is about just this – it’s not all light and love, and yet somehow things can open up after adversity, “the lucky dark” as Roshi wrote.]]>

      <title>Ep. 132 - From Real Love &amp; Rilke to Real Life Envy &amp; Jealousy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[What is real love?  What isn’t?  The Mindrollers turn for inspiration to HH The Dalai Lama and the super intense poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, who said “For one human being to love another, that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks”…talk of cultivating inner spaciousness as the ultimate antidote. Jumping off from a Tricycle article, David confesses Johnny Depp envy while Raghu remembers the perverse joy in jealousy…the answer to these neurotic pulls seems always around finding the freeing route to the heart, your own heart.  Sometimes, instead of fervently reaching for another soul, a spell of serious solitude might help that journey.  Speaking to youth, Rilke says: “They have to learn it.  With their whole being, with all their forces, gathered close about their lonely, timid, upward-beating heart, they must learn to love.”]]>

        <![CDATA[Raghu The Intrepid takes a trip to the jungles of India and to an extraordinary Baba - Dave quickly calms him down about his hesitation to share the adventure, the yatra, with all comers, fearing self-indulgence – although the Brit pedant in Mr. Silver recoils at the “cuddle puddle ” metaphor. 
Dave introduces the essential reality of the trust everyone has to have to be able to take the inner pathway and hear the true experience. The journey is taken with two millenials - Jyoti and Gagan. They encounter up close the austerities the Baba practices that are seemingly from Rudyard Kipling’s Jungle Book.  Raghu & Co. on location get heavily into the reality of transformational moments, emphasizing that it’s not a matter of collecting them, but rather how they can contribute to our being, simply put, better humans.
And Gagan so aptly recalls a line from the cowboy in the Big Lebowski that rings true about the Baba- “I don't know about you, but I take comfort in knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.”
Enjoy this rare insight into life far from the grid and further into the soul realm.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Embrace everything - bad and good, pleasurable and horrible. Chris’s new book, Everything Mind, comes out today. R & D talk with him about its prescient premise that everything – the whole kit and caboodle – from Trump to Ramana Maharshi to the suffering migrant millions to the iPhone 6S Plus - is a legitimate part of the spiritual reality: G-d, The One, whatever, and that this is a necessary and healing component of the spiritual/philosophical inclusion clause – everything is grist to the mill. Even a harsh and hurtful text insult message, even true pain and adversity, even hideous stuff - within you and without you - even Kimye! Chris’s own words on his book: “What I've Learned About Hard Knocks, Spiritual Awakening, and the Mind-Blowing Truth of It All.” Plus David recalls his amazingly counter-intuitive 9/11 kindness experience.]]>

      <title>Ep. 127 - Ram Dev Explores Deathlessness:  From Fear To Being Right Here</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ram Dev (Dale Borglum) of the Living Dying Project explores surfing the edge of the heart approaching consciousness transformation, in life…and death. Who dies anyway? How do we change annihilation fear to being right here, still confidently in the heart chakra? “All fear is fear of death” he maintains, “being trapped in separateness” and how the deeper fright is resistance to death rather than death itself. We talk through wholeness and healing for the living as well as those passing and those immediately affected. This seems like heavy stuff, but the end product in this hour is light and insight…into living.]]>

        <![CDATA[“My yellow in this case is not so mellow” Jimi Hendrix sang. Is it ever cool to be angry? R & D’s wary warnings about the seductively enjoyable taste of anger. Maharaji’s words about anger’s reality, with the crucial caveat to never throw anyone out of your heart. Raghu’s anger is analyzed by… Raghu. David recalls learning to love right wing friends, especially conservative William F. Buckley Jr. Then we talk about Mark Epstein’s take on anger and his very do-able way of dealing with it.
David reads a Tom Waits poem about Keith Richards. Finally we dive deep into Trungpa’s Gap - "the space between out breaths” (Pema Chodron) the spaciousness between internal chatter and the sudden glimpse of awareness, openness and absence of self - which scares the shit out of us.]]>

      <title>Ep. 123 - Gelek Rimpoche</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Gelek Rimpoche is our honored guest.  A reincarnated tulku, a lucid and unpretentious disperser of essential knowledge, Gelek is a treasured being we are so lucky to have in the U.S.  Because of the ruthless Chinese invasion, Gelek was forced to leave his beloved homeland in 1959.  Tibet’s tragedy became our great fortune.  Hear what he has to say about wiping out negative emotions and achieving equanimity.  His honest-to-the-bone words about his own basic humanity is a balm for all of us.  Rimpoche shares his own Allen Ginsberg stories with David, who was also a friend of the legendary poet/kind soul.  The Mindrollers are so pleased to present this famed and revered Rimpoche, a sacred yet approachable transformative being, there for all of us.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Mindrollers with Duncan Trussell and Noah Lampert host our panel guests from our Indiegogo event. Brian, Brian and George. We get an idea of their awakening triggers, pretty heavy ones at that- and they shine a light on the importance of intention. We all talk about practice and how difficult it is to motivate daily unless you are really up against the wall!
Duncan admits to his fall down on learning the Hanuman Chaleesa when he can’t even remember his phone number. David regales us with sacred chants - Raghu relates his story of doubt - And finally Duncan pulls out his trusty Bible and leads us in a Bible study group.]]>

        <![CDATA[Forgiveness wisdom from George Pitagorsky (Balaram) who demonstrates the huge upside of being able to authentically forgive, and how forgiving often benefits the forgiver maybe even more than the forgiven. Is it weakness for a Holocaust victim to embrace one of her tormentors? Wasn’t it incredible for the afflicted Charleston families to espouse forgiveness immediately?

      <title>Ep. 119 - The Inside Circle</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Raghu and David bring up a very timely topic - prison reform. BJ Wasserman and Jared “Gagan” Levy discuss Inside Circle, a nonprofit organization that helps prisoners and parolees heal from the inside.
We talk about “operational transformation” of men in Folsom prison as a model for the entire prison system. Robert Allbee, founder of Inside Circle, created a concept for the word “spirit” or “God” which the Dagara tribe in Africa call “Yielbongura” - “The thing that Knowledge can’t eat.” This phrase sums up the spiritual core from which Inside Circle operates.
Where are you imprisoned in your life?
The process that the prisoners go through in revealing their deep authentic truths create an atmosphere of trust that is dramatically changing the static model of prison reform.]]>

Does so-called objective, provable truth matter if you are inarguably elevated or awakened?]]>

      <title>Ep. 97 - Walking Home</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[• Exploring Death (It’s all the rage) - The truth is that we have no idea what happens when we drop our body, so it’s hard to say whether any particular reaction is appropriate or not. The sooner we face the reality of our mortality, the more time we have to approach it
• Heart to Heart - Buddha was one heart, and turned on many. As we go deeper into ourselves we radiate that frequency to the world around us. We find balance and share what we learn.
• Finding Balance (Change your conscious) - Even systems like capitalism can function, but only if there is balance. All we can bring to the present situation is greater consciousness
• Sharon Salzberg (Official Badass) - Sharon did the work, and it shows. We all have different approaches to experiment with, but they all involve doing what is necessary to get free. Where we are is just an accumulation of our innate experiential wisdom
• Protective Fashion - Styles of dress can be an attempt to associate oneself with a certain mode of thinking, but can also serve as a simple reminder to stay true to what you value
• Modern Kindness -¬ Raghu and Dave remark on the encouraging level of consideration among the current youth. The greater exposure to the true connectedness of our lives seems to be generating a greater concern for and appreciation of our collective future
• Family Ties (The ties that bind) - Michael points to the influence of tradition and spoon-fed comfort that can perpetuate nefarious actions within powerful families or corporations. What to do? Angry protests, or perhaps more mindfulness oriented actions?
• The Reality of Love (The only reality) - Kindness, compassion - these are the only religions. It doesn’t eliminate suffering, but it allows us to se through it, and to move toward relieving it
• Ganesh (The gateway drug) - We often need to use something to focus our attention on. The deeper we move into the practice, the more we understand that it’s what these objects represent that we are seeking. The best methods seem to self destruct]]>

        <![CDATA[• Exploring Death (It’s all the rage) - The truth is that we have no idea what happens when we drop our body, so it’s hard to say whether any particular reaction is appropriate or not. The sooner we face the reality of our mortality, the more time we have to approach it
• Heart to Heart - Buddha was one heart, and turned on many. As we go deeper into ourselves we radiate that frequency to the world around us. We find balance and share what we learn.
• Finding Balance (Change your conscious) - Even systems like capitalism can function, but only if there is balance. All we can bring to the present situation is greater consciousness
• Sharon Salzberg (Official Badass) - Sharon did the work, and it shows. We all have different approaches to experiment with, but they all involve doing what is necessary to get free. Where we are is just an accumulation of our innate experiential wisdom
• Protective Fashion - Styles of dress can be an attempt to associate oneself with a certain mode of thinking, but can also serve as a simple reminder to stay true to what you value
• Modern Kindness -¬ Raghu and Dave remark on the encouraging level of consideration among the current youth. The greater exposure to the true connectedness of our lives seems to be generating a greater concern for and appreciation of our collective future
• Family Ties (The ties that bind) - Michael points to the influence of tradition and spoon-fed comfort that can perpetuate nefarious actions within powerful families or corporations. What to do? Angry protests, or perhaps more mindfulness oriented actions?
• The Reality of Love (The only reality) - Kindness, compassion - these are the only religions. It doesn’t eliminate suffering, but it allows us to se through it, and to move toward relieving it
• Ganesh (The gateway drug) - We often need to use something to focus our attention on. The deeper we move into the practice, the more we understand that it’s what these objects represent that we are seeking. The best methods seem to self destruct]]>

      <title>Ep. 96 - Dharma Bums</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[• Bums United - Ian explains how he was introduced to the mindrollers, and discusses some of his early transformers, including the discovery of transcendental meditation, and subsequently Buddhism
• Don’t be a Buddhist (Be a Buddha) - There are no rules in Buddhism, just suggestions, which point in the direction of awakening. We can all have unique methods that move us closer to that state of awareness. Ian makes it a point to include Metta as part of his practice, citing it as a major shift on his path. Raghu highlights the synergistic effects of Vipassana in combination with the practice of Metta - Quiet the mind, invoke the heart
• The Last Irish Monk - Ian talks about his initial discovery of U Dhammaloka, and the subsequent inspiration that led to his current film project, through which he hopes to rescue the great sage from obscurity
• ‘Warning to Buddhists’ (Choice words from U Dhammaloka) Ian reads from some of the more controversial work of the late Irish monk, and expresses his deep admiration for the courage displayed throughout his mysterious existence - Engaged Buddhism is underated
• Down with Dogma - U Dhammaloka was well known for his proactive and outspoken nature. His disappearance from history is not so surprising, given his proclivity for exposing untruths that undermine the established order
• Cultural Considerations - Dave inquires about potential parallels between the struggles of Theos Bernard and those of U Dhammaloka in being accepted into these cultures. Raghu explains the greater acceptance in places like Burma, as opposed to the stricter standards of Tibet
• Bum Support - Help Ian share this lost wisdom by donating to his current crowd funding campaign
• Timeless Message - The actions taken by this little known Irish monk are as applicable today as they were in his time - Make your life your message]]>

      <title>Ep. 95 - McMindfulness</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[• Phobias Formed (Blame our ancestors) - Science points to direct experiences in forming phobias that can be found further down the genetic line. Raghu rattles off some of the more interesting fears in the modern age - does ignorance play a role in many of these irrational fears?
• Mindfulness vs. Therapy (Head to Head) - Spiritual circles sometimes frown upon psychoanalysis, citing its potential to perpetuate thought patterns. We have to keep in mind that meditation alone can’t always provide the healing one might need. Some of the deeper wounds and unconscious fears can linger beyond meditations reach. Raghu agrees, and offers some of his own personal experience with therapy, advising to find someone who isn’t attached to any one school of thought. Dave highlights the unique brand of modern neuroses, which may require a multifaceted approach
• Wounds (Deep Cuts) - Dave highlights the unique brand of modern neuroses, which may require a multifaceted approach. Can meditation and therapy adapt to the ever-evolving market of suffering?
• Embrace, Explore and Understand - Working with your shadow is a difficult task, regardless of how you approach it. It requires a deep commitment to be honest and loving with yourself
• Prolonging Mourning Meditation - At times, your practice may be preventing you from fully addressing your suffering. Try to avoid the spiritual bypass of pushing these issues away
• Emancipatory Meditation (Choiceless Awareness?) - “Involves intimacy with oneself as an extraordinary and vital activity in which one attends to whatever one is experiencing without any preconceived conclusions, and without trying to get rid if it” - Don’t encourage, but be aware, without judgment
• Ogre as Guru - Dave comments on one of the ‘Eight Verses of Thought Transformation’ by Kadampa Geshe Langri Tangpa. Through practice we learn to transform what we detest - The teachings are everywhere and everyone. But, how do we actually apply this to real life horror, and when is it appropriate to act? Dave points to the current terror of ISIS, and draws on the teachings of the Dalai Lama in sorting this mess out
• Taking Up Arms (With Brothers in Arms) - How can we remain mindful when using force, and play out our roles without attachment.]]>

      <title>Ep. 92 - Hanging with Jack Carroll</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Sam Harris (In the self-help section) - The gang weighs in on Mr. Harris, and his attempt to make an ‘intellectual case for those skeptical of the whole enterprise’. How should we approach his demand for validation regarding spiritual experiences
The Media’s Role - Dave comments on the media’s false claim that the current youth is rejecting all religion, despite all the evidence that points to an increased interest in yoga, meditation, mysticism and psychedelics. Religion can’t be limited to specific guidelines Jack discusses his fluctuating stance regarding religion and it’s practices. In the end, a direct personal experience is difficult to disqualify. Can we definitively answer these questions?
The Debate Rolls On - There appears to be an endless, ‘Us versus them’, quality to these discussions. The heated debates aren’t even limited to those in opposing fields of study. The good news is that more and more individuals seem to be open to all sides of the argument
‘Self’-Help - Who is really benefiting, and how? These books can sometimes be a distraction from dealing with our true sources of distress
Adaptive Spirituality – Previous civilizations, with far less knowledge of the working universe, espoused certain religious views in an attempt to understand their role. Many of these belief systems are still at work, though clearly limited in scope. An open and contemplative approach toward the truth is crucial in avoiding dogmatic doctrine. If certain facets are proven to be flawed or unsound then we have to accept, and even embrace, the need for change
The Real Initiation (Break your head) – Raghu recounts the story of a Maharaji devotee, and his personal encounter with the profound presence of direct experience. It’s a change in vantage point, not a lobotomy
Judging Faith (Spiritual discrimination) – What about the folks who haven’t experienced the mind melting effects of these mystical encounters? Are they to simply trust those that make these claims? When we calm our mind, through meditation or other practices, our awareness deepens and we are better able to identify with the true Self. From this place, we seem less likely to be fooled or manipulated, in forming beliefs.
Where Are You Coming From? – Rachael describes her recent experience in India, pointing to the heart-centered nature of the culture, as a whole. To them, family is everything, and this shows in their attitudes and traditions. Unfortunately, this sentiment has somewhat dissipated in the cities, and is beginning to resemble the more fractured relationships that are so predominant in the West
People Are the Problem – These age-old arguments have been commonplace for as long as civilization has existed. How can we bridge the seemingly endless gap? Practice, practice, practice!]]>

The Real Initiation (Break your head) – Raghu recounts the story of a Maharaji devotee, and his personal encounter with the profound presence of direct experience. It’s a change in vantage point, not a lobotomy
Judging Faith (Spiritual discrimination) – What about the folks who haven’t experienced the mind melting effects of these mystical encounters? Are they to simply trust those that make these claims? When we calm our mind, through meditation or other practices, our awareness deepens and we are better able to identify with the true Self. From this place, we seem less likely to be fooled or manipulated, in forming beliefs.
Where Are You Coming From? – Rachael describes her recent experience in India, pointing to the heart-centered nature of the culture, as a whole. To them, family is everything, and this shows in their attitudes and traditions. Unfortunately, this sentiment has somewhat dissipated in the cities, and is beginning to resemble the more fractured relationships that are so predominant in the West
People Are the Problem – These age-old arguments have been commonplace for as long as civilization has existed. How can we bridge the seemingly endless gap? Practice, practice, practice!]]>

      <title>Ep. 91 - Skeptiko</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mr. Skeptiko (Skeptical, even of skeptics) - Alex encourages an assiduous examination of consciousness and those who deny it's all-pervasive nature
Debunking the Debunker - How do we know when we are dealing with the Truth? Bias seems to be more common than not in many forms of journalism. When 'the facts' are actually put to light, they don't often shine so bright
NDE (Not limited to the hospital) - Alex explains his takeaway from Eden Alexander's book, 'Proof of Heaven'. These experiences are ubiquitous, across many cultures, through many lifetimes. To truly study them requires a broad examination of the many ways in which they manifest
Imprinting - Many faces, many forms - All of which are manifestations of the One. Maharaji, a Hindu Guru, said to 'meditate like Christ'
Science vs. Consciousness (Epiphenomenon of the Brain?) Science treats consciousness as a byproduct of the brain, in the same way that insulin is a byproduct of the pancreas. But when asked about the necessary precursors to consciousness, they aren't able to pin it down. Science tends to resist the expansion of its current paradigm to encompass the mystery that is human consciousness
Psychedelics (Where do they fit in?) - Alex discusses some of the research being regarding the role of psychedelics in understanding consciousness. These compounds seem to be revealing more of what is already there, rather than simply skewing 'normal' reality
High-Minded Mysticism - Dave points out the prevalence of decidedly intelligent individuals among the outspoken proponents of many mystical and spiritual traditions. Unfortunately, much of Western culture is reluctant to let go of the 'out of sight, out of mind' mantra
Wrong Narrative (Have we all been duped?) - Who do we trust, and how do we trust them?
Science (Weak Samadhi) - The candle held by science seems to only reveal more darkness
Trust - (Being home, and knowing it) - The felt presence of direct experience is crucial, but science is unable to dissect it, and therefore diminishes its relevance
The Maharaji Connection - People, of all ages, all over the world, have been affected by Maharaji and his devotees. How could all of these individual experiences be mere coincidence?
Skeptical Mindrolling - There is a wonderful community unfolding online, with forward-thinking at its foundation. The access is unprecedented and will only continue to expand
Consumerism (A 'natural' byproduct of materialism) - Control seems to be at the center of this issue. "What better way to control your consciousness than to say it doesn't exist?' Much of what we take for granted in our culture is dependent upon this operating system
The Mindrolling Mission - Try not to espouse opinions or beliefs about occurrences you haven't directly experienced]]>

      <title>Ep. 90 - Abundance</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[• Frozen Baba - Ashutosh Maharaj and his sub-zero Samadhi. Does the quality of one’s practice reveal itself in the often-remarkable deaths of great beings?
• Genuine Insights (From a questionable politician) - Do seemingly nefarious actions preclude individuals from benevolent intuitions? Highlights the ongoing, ‘Us vs. Them’, conundrum. We are all complex beings, and we have to remain open to allow space for acceptance • Dave Finds Love (For an unlikely candidate)
• Abundance Without Attachment (The holiday hustle) Prosperity and materialism are a common theme during the often-excessive holiday season. It’s attachment to money, not money itself that is the problem. How to get free? 1. Collect experience, not things. 2. Steer clear of excessive ‘usefulness’. 3. Get to the center of the wheel - What is the transcendental truth at the center of your wheel? Find it and focus. For Raghu and David this comes through the understanding and experience of God, Guru, and Self as One. Their material world revolves around this fundamental truth • Just Do It (For the sake of doing) - Mindfulness and joy result when our actions are motivated by the process rather than the result
• ‘Sticky Desire’ - Our ‘desperate grasping’ fueled by fear of separation from our objects of desire (relationships, social status etc.)
• Welfare (Farewell?) - The distribution of wealth in modern times is staggering and unprecedented. How do we approach this issue without bias?
• The Mindrolling Mission - All these issues come back to the central question of finding balance, and cultivating an all-inclusive attitude toward our lives]]>

      <title>Ep. 87 - Ram Dass On The Near Death Experience</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ram Dass talks with the Mindrollers about NDE, the safety of death, light beings, the Soul Pod, the Tibetan Book of the Dead…and G-d’s extensive wardrobe. He ends with describing his joy at witnessing the awakenings of so many people he has influenced.
Episode Outline:
• Ram Dass’ Impression of the NDE - We are ushered into the perspective of the Soul, and encounter other ‘light beings’ that seek to understand our connection to our previous incarnation. These beings are our ‘Soul Land Companions’
• From Ego to Soul - When we operate at the Soul level, our perception shifts into a heightened state of compassionate awareness
• The Soul comes directly from God - The Atman (the One) is in everything. We move from Ego, to Soul, to the One - from that place of awareness, we are all indistinguishable • The Soulpod Satsang
• The Unifying Bond of the ‘Soul Complex’ (The Undying Soul)
• Drop, Become, Merge - Moving out of the perceptual mind and into the ocean of Love • ‘Death is Safe’ - Approaching death, without being overcome by fear
• Parallels Between Psychedelics, NDE, and The Tibetan Book of the Dead
• Cultural/Religious Imprinting (God’s Extensive Wardrobe) - There are many forms, but the message is consistent
• Approaching the Transition - Ram Dass describes his experience and preparation in moving closer to death. Everything he can say and do is under the control of Maharaji. He witnesses all that comes to him with joy, rather than attachment
• Unending Awakening - Ram Dass continues to awaken through everything and everyone that he encounters. We can always trust in the eternal presence of Love, in whatever form it comes
• Dropping the Body - In death, the Soul drops the body, and moves on, in an intimate relationship with God, with the One]]>

        <![CDATA["The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are. You trade in your reality for a role. You trade in your sense for an act.

It's got to happen inside first." - Jim Morrison]]>

      <title>Ep. 13 - Politics and Spirituality</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Activism without anger, resistance without rancor: it's hard to reach detachment when the political world is making you crazy.  What to do?
Vajravarahi is a spiritual energy deity perceived to transmute the Five Negative Afflictions which represent five obstructions that obscure the true nature of life.  These Five Afflictions are greed, hatred, delusion, jealousy and pride. Like all fearsome figures in Tantric Buddhism, she is protective & simply wrathful for beneficial reasons. 
She fits the bill for helping change the negative emotions that prevent us from balancing ourselves or society.
