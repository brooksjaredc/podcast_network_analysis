			<description><![CDATA[<p>I have been dreaming of going on a motorcycle adventure into North Vietnam since the last time I was in Hanoi and heard of the concept.</p> <div>This was only my fourth time ever driving a motorcycle and I think it will be hard to beat this experience of going the 90 miles round trip journey from Hanoi to the top of Tam Dao Mountain. Yes it was terrifying and yes I felt like a true bad ass with Steve McQueen courage especially after I crashed going up the thin and dusty mountain road. Just as the key to happiness is in lowering your expectations it is equally important to remember that your dreams just might end up killing you if you are not careful. It is a miracle that I was not seriously injured when my motorcycle went sliding out from under me and I was high with joy for hours afterward that I was alive and that I had only lost a swatch of skin off of my elbow.</div> <div> </div> <div>In this episode I recount my journey to the top of the mountain and the dangers one encounters while operating a motorcycle in the countryside of Vietnam and in the city of Hanoi. I'm thrilled to say that I checked this dream off of my lifelong wish list and that so much beauty was captured with my eyeballs and will live on in my memory forever. My life has been unbelievably blessed with magnificent experiences and I'm happy to tell you now in this episode all about my Vietnam motorcycle adventure and my mountain road crash that could have been a lot worse.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Uncle Bob is dead.</p> <div>Getting the news of his death has left me feeling ashamed because I was mean and cruel to him. I had not spoken to Bob in 7 years because I was angry at him for being mean and cruel to my dad. Hate and anger is poison in your life because the person you are holding a grudge against just might drop dead and then your issue with that person will never be resolved.</div> <div> </div> <div>The truth of the matter is that my Uncle Bob was a very important person to me. Had he not done stand up comedy in Washington D.C. in 1978 then my dad would have not taken me to see him and I might not have turned out to be a stand up comedian. After he died I was flooded with good memories of him and I will be forever haunted by the fact that neither one of us reached out to each other to fix the ill feelings that kept us using silence against each other.</div> <div> </div> <div>My Uncle Bob's life was a victory because he found a woman who loved him, he had a successful career and he retired to a lovely farm in Vermont.</div> <div> </div> <div>This episode is a repeat. It was recorded in July 2009 in his back yard just after the sun went down. It was the 2nd podcast I ever posted. We were a little drunk when we recorded this and I only had one microphone that we passed back and forth. It is a happy memory and his advice to me at the end about getting your soul damaged is invaluable.</div> <div> </div> <div>Of the many happy memories I have of him one of them happened while I was visiting him when I was in my 30s. The James Taylor song 'Shower The People' came on the radio and he sang it to me as he hugged me tight. I would give anything to have that moment back now.</div> <div> </div> <div>I wish that he were still alive so that I could tell him "I'm sorry Bob. I love you."</div>]]></description>

Since living in Los Angeles we have invented a game we like to call "Book Roulette." This game consists of us randomly pulling a book from the shelf, cracking it open and reading a few paragraphs or highlights from that book to each other. It is our nerdy way of plucking riches of the written word for the delight of our brains. It is our way of entertaining ourselves on cold rainy nights like tonight when we recorded this episode. Living among thousands of books means nothing if you are not gaining anything from them. That is why we invented this game and share it only with good friends who come to our place and like to get cozy with inspiration. So brace yourself and get ready for explosions of powerful words from the shelves of Tom and Ashna. You will most certainly be enriched with pearls of words and thoughts that will tingle you to the core of your soul.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is part 3 of my French Revolution episodes celebrating the Stanley Loomis book Paris In The Terror. Have you ever wondered how people with differing political opinions would hate each other enough to have each other's heads chopped off by the guillotine? The answer to that can be found in this episode about the end of the road for that shifty dirty bastard Robespierre. Robespierre was a mediocre provincial lawyer who came to Paris and became one of the darkest forces in the drama that was the French Revolution. The enlightenment period was when field workers started to wake up and ask themselves "Why do those rich assholes get to live in the castle and wear fine clothes while we do all of the hard work?" This led to the French Revolution where king Louis XVI and his family all got their heads chopped off, then the citizens found out they loved chopping heads off so much they started cutting everyone's head off who may have disagreed with them. Robespierre out maneuvered Danton to become dictator for one year but there was a man named Fouche lurking in the shadows out maneuvering Robespierre. In this episode you will learn about The Festival Of Reason that turned into a drunken orgy in the most famous churches in Paris. Then with astounding magnitude you will marvel at the blunder that turned out to be the end for Robespierre. Get your smelly French cheeses ready, slice your baguette at an angle and pour yourself a glass of Pierre for this amazing ride that is the blood bath of heads falling into baskets otherwise known as the French Revolution. Just remember that it was all done for the good of the people, as is this podcast. Ashna and I now present to you, your brain food for the day. Bon Appetite! </p> <p> </p> <p>* Become our patron and receive podcast goodies! www.patreon.com/tomrhodesradiosmartcamp</p> <p>* Buy my newest double album All Hail Laughter (2017) tomrhodes.net</p> <p>* More episodes on tomrhodesradio.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I am proud to say now that my eyes do know the glory that is Mongolia.<br /> This past weekend I performed in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and I now rank it among my favorite places. Like all great experiences you have in life it comes down to the people that you spent time with. From the moment I arrived I was greatly by the comedians of Ulaanbaatar and they spent my few days there showing me everything that was magnificent about their country. To prepare for this trip I read the biography of Genghis Khan and I had in my mind all of their glorious history and the many ways that Mongolia shook the world and shaped human history. In this episode I talk about my own experiences performing in Mongolia and the generous loving humans that make up the comedy scene there. I also read the many highlights I made in the book by Jack Weatherford called 'Genghis Khan and the making of the modern world.' Did you know that Genghis Khan had a policy of religious tolerance of all the lands that he conquered? Did you know that ancient Mongolia gave the world ice cream? Did you know that the English word "Hooray" comes from ancient Mongolia? Well, put on your learning hat because you are about to learn many things that will enrich your life as I tell you the tale about my visit to Mongolia and read to you the highlights of this incredibly informative book that I just read. Hooray for Mongolia and hooray for humanity!</p> <p>Tom</p> <p> </p> <p>Become our patron and receive podcast goodies!</p> <p>www.patreon.com/tomrhodesradiosmartcamp </p> <p> </p> <p>Buy my newest double album All Hail Laughter (2017)</p> <p>tom@tomrhodes.net</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

Not every podcast episode can be happy and cheerful but thankfully, Ashna pulls me back from the brink and helps me to see the bright side of life. It all comes down to status anxiety and that is what we discuss at length in this episode from every angle. We also talk about Allan du Botton, the entertainment juggernaut that is Netflix, the poet Pablo Neruda, my favorite Italian movies and the Ken Burns documentary about the Vietnam war. The number one enemy of happiness is envy. Curb your desires now and enjoy the brains and hearts of the Tom and Ashna show! Shalom amigos y amigas!</p>]]></description>

For all the criticism that has fallen on Hugh Hefner for being sexist he doesn't get enough credit for breaking the color barrier in terms of hiring performers at his clubs and models for his magazine at a time when the United States was racially segregated. In this episode we talk about my own personal history with Playboy magazine and how the Playboy interviews were a very important part of my entertainment apprenticeship. We discuss the rise of George Carlin and Lenny Bruce who performed at the Playboy clubs and which entertainer who couldn't keep his hands to himself. This important period in American entertainment history and the history of American censorship is but a distant memory for those who remember and this is a conversation I was happy to capture for the Smart Camp audience. So put on your bunny ears and you fluffy slippers and find out why the  Playboy empire was a crucial component in the history of American comedy.</div> <div>It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Patty Farmer!</div> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I kick off this visit to Amsterdam by celebrating my obsession with the artist Rembrandt! In this episode I talk with noted Rembrandt author Nina Siegal about all things Rembrandt. Why did Rembrandt paint so many self portraits? Why did he own so many turtle shells? What were the poor choices he made that led to his downfall? Why did he fall out of favor with the religious society of Amsterdam? Why was Rembrandts body dug up and where is he buried now? You will learn many details about the fascinating life of one of art history's greatest masters. Nina Siegal wrote the best selling book 'The Anatomy Lesson' about the Rembrandt painting 'The Anatomy Lesson Of Dr. Nicholaes Tulp' and aside from being very knowledgable about the life of Rembrandt she is also an expert on the Jewish history of Amsterdam. As a bonus you will learn why true Amsterdammers when they say goodbye, they say "Mazzel" and why the soccer team of Amsterdam "Ajax" get anti-Semitic slurs when they play around Europe. This episode is full of Smart Camp Knowledge Nuggets and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Nina Siegal!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Bonjour mon amis! In this episode Ashna and I come to Paris for me to do a show and we stretch it out into a week long visit with summer in full swing.</p> <div>We start the episode with the update on the crazy downstairs neighbors we have who got in Ashna's face and challenged me to a fight right before we left for Europe.</div> <div>If you arrive in Paris we are jet lagged and walking the streets until sunrise.</div> <div>Learn why the apartment we are staying in Ashna describes as the Horror Toilet. We have books on philosophy and jazz records but one theme keeps repeating itself over and over of our Parisian home for the week. In this episode you will learn the best travel tips we have discovered like Rue Montorgueil otherwise known as Tasty Street. Learn how we made an art out of collecting items and perfected the joy of picnicking in Paris. Where are the best places to picnic in Paris?</div> <div>We reveal the feature of our neighborhood in Paris that reminds me of every Henry Miller book I have ever read. My show in Paris was in a sweltering hot room and I performed while soaking with sweat. We discuss how the meaning of jokes can change and the best response to this persistent problem. How do you create timeless comedy? How do you choose the best cheeses and pastries in Paris?</div> <div>Where is the best place to watch the Super Bowl in Paris? When is the worst time to try to visit the catacombs in Paris? How best to visit the Pere Llachaise cemetery? After answering these questions I read to Ashna the best quotes by the most famous authors who are buried in Pere Llachaise cemetery. If you can't afford to travel this summer or are planning a trip to Paris you can take a trip with Ashna and I now to the city of love while in the full bloom of summer. I have a long history with Paris and in this episode I try to give all the knowledge nuggets on Paris that will enrich your life, like the secret hidden latin phrase on Jim Morrison's grave. As an insult my brother once said to me "You know Tom, you just want to hang out in cafes in Paris and read books that no one else understands." He was correct and now I'm back and sharing my thoughts on this magic city with you. Bonne Journee!</div>]]></description>

Take a ride out of the doldrums and depression by letting us show you how to look on the bright side. In this episode Ashna and I talk about out trip to New York where we hung out with Dave Attell and Michael Che. Learn how I dealt with following Amy Schumer and her story about paying someone to masturbate her father. Learn how to deal with your buzz kill neighbors the Seneca way and what Netflix really thinks of white guys. Learn who Tony Woods thinks is the second most angry black man that he knows. We also discuss the shooting of Republicans on a baseball field in Virginia and the verdict in the Philander Castille killing. On a happier note we talk about the book Paris, a biography of a city and the excellent Ken Burns documentary The Roosevelts and the lesson to be learned from Teddy Roosevelt's life that can be valuable to all. The Einstein series called Genius gets a favorable mention as does the Jimi Hendrix baby gift we sent to fans of our podcast we met in Texas.

because he has been  such a profound influence in my life. I
was lucky enough to have seen him in concert 4 times. The most

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Barry Katz has dedicated his life to stand up comedy and like anyone who has done so he has experienced many highs and lows. His life's journey has been an epic tale and throughout it all he has remained one of the most positive good humored people I have ever known in this business. He once managed Louie CK, Dave Chappelle and Tracy Morgan. He produced Last Comic Standing for the first 7 years of that shows run and now he hosts his own podcast called The Industry Standard. </p>
<div>On his podcast he talks with agents, producers and television executives about the nuts and bolts of the entertainment industry. In this episode he gives invaluable advice on being a comedian, succeeding in television, succeeding in life and most importantly to me, picking yourself up after you have experienced the devastating tragedy of losing a loved one. This is a must listen to anyone who dreams of being a better comedian and a better human being. For me personally, I was also very happy to finally return to him his bathroom key that I walked away with accidentally when I was a guest on his podcast. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Barry Katz!</div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Gene Sullivan has a life story so incredible it should be made into a movie. His father was the renowned San Francisco Examiner sports writer Prescott Sullivan which got him dedicated to a life in sports. in 1969 he left a promising boxing career to be Evel Knievel's bodyguard before Evel was a household name. After money and fame went to Evel Knievel's head Gene broke out on his own as a daredevil who dedicated his life to Jesus and started his own daredevil ministry Jump For Jesus. jumpforjesus.net To hear Gene tell the story of leaving Knievel he says that "The bible tells us to turn away from evil." His jumps has a deep meaning and his life has a purpose. I met Gene Sullivan the last time I was in Montana 5 years ago on a search for the remnants of my boyhood hero Evel Knievel. Gene turned out to be the kind hearted guy I guess I had hoped Evel would have been had I ever met him. He and Evel Knievel made peace at the end of Evel's life and Gene gave the eulogy at his funeral. He is sought out for any movie or special made about the life of Evel Knievel because he was there for most of it. He can be seen in the new Johnny Knoxville produced documentary called 'Being Evel" He is someone I am proud to call a friend and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Gene Sullivan!</p>

<div>He established himself many years ago as a purveyor of original hilarious songs and tours regularly crushing skulls with his laugh inducing music. Aside from his music he has harnessed his abilities lately with the making of his underground classic comedy clips on youtube.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Henry's Kitchen is his humorous take on the many cooking videos that abound on the internet today, but none with the stinging hilarity that Henry infuses as his main ingredient. You & You're Fu*king Coffee is the other series of excellently written video short series clips that has become so popular that Mike Judge starred in one because he was such a fan of them. I highly recommend Henry's Big Foot episode of You & You're Fu*king Coffee with Rick Overton as the park ranger.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>He is a man of many talents and someone who I am always happy to see because he is always striving for more in his creativity and he is the least pretentious person ever to work in show business and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Henry Phillips!</div>

<div>While doing the Kuala Lumpur International Comedy Festival Matt Davis and I sat down to talk about doing comedy all over the world. Matt was inspired by my years of living the nomadic life of a comedian with no home and now he has thrown caution to the wind and he is on his own epic adventure. It is Matt's plan to tour all over the world for a year if he can set the gigs up to cover the time span and end his journey at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It is a brave ambitious plan and I was happy to meet up with him on his Asian segment of this journey. From here he will go to India and Africa. He needs help to plug in the holes in his calendar and I am just the guy to offer him help and advice. The man from Birmingham, Alabama is expanding his horizons and that is why it is my pleasure to welcome back to my show the one and only Matt Davis!</div>

After having having traveled the world Nebraska is a very exotic place to me. People in lumberjack shirts and Cornhusker hats seem like movie extras to me. Please enjoy the one and only me!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Ron White is one of my favorite comedians and it is for very personal reasons that I am his fan. I started out on the Southern circuits of the United States just as Ron White did and I knew about him years before the rest of the world did because we were doing the same gigs. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I think what I like the most about Ron is I know how hard he worked to get where he is today and it gives me hope that it is possible for older hard working comedians to bust the lid off of show business and "make it."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I watch him perform it is like watching your favorite team play who wins every time because he always delivers the goods. I love hearing him talk about his private jet and when I hear him do so I think to myself "Damn right brother, you deserve your own private jet." </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Through the small world of comedy and the mutual friends we have I got to record this conversation with Ron last month in Las Vegas. I got to watch him from the back stage area of The Mirage casino destroy a sold out house, then I waited patiently as Olivia Newton John stopped by his dressing room to tell him she was a fan before I got to come into his dressing room to have this chat.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">My favorite quote from this conversation is when he said "For change to happen, old people with their stupid ideas need to die." It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Ron White!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>As a member of the Screen Actors Guild I get viewing copies of each film that is nominated for Academy Awards every Oscar season. It is one of the perks I most enjoy about being a member of SAG. However, because of my busy touring schedule I was unable to watch the movies before the actual Academy Awards happened.</p>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Recently when I was home visiting my Mother I caught up on all of the movies I had missed with my Mom and my wife Ashna. I thought it would be funny to get my Mom's opinion on all of these movies since my Mom is a conservative Christian Republican with a much different world view than my own.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">We watched 3 movies at home and then sat down after each one and reviewed them. The 4th movie we watched was nominated for best foreign film and was playing at the Enzian theater in Maitland, Florida. The Enzian is the premiere independent art house theater of Orlando where I have watched movies throughout the years with my family and is one of my favorite places in my hometown of the Orlando area. The 4 movies that we watched and talk about in this episode are:</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Cake</div>

			<description><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Howard Mabie was my Varsity baseball coach at Oviedo high school and he was one of the most influential people I had during my young life.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Coach Mabie had a way of inspiring people and bringing out the best that they had to offer. He is a top quality human being who had a major impact on many lives in his coaching career and he was an integral part of what made Oviedo, Florida such a golden place of memories back in the time period when it was still a charming citrus village. He was not only funny, good natured and made young minds feel valuable but he was also a damn good Science teacher. In today's world with so much perversion, larceny and corruption in our school systems a man like Howard Mabie is hard to come by and that is why I am celebrating him here. Throughout my life whenever there has been a situation where I got to play baseball or softball I am still to this day a deadly hitter and that is because of the skills that he taught me. The wisdom and philosophy in baseball that he taught me I have quoted and applied to my life ever since. </div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">"You should never be trying to hit a homer, a homer should be the accident of a line drive."

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I like his style and his intelligence that he brings to the stage and most importantly in the course of our friendship we never chit chat about insignificant things but always dig deep into each others brains where the best thoughts live.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I have always said that London was the key to getting into the world wide circuits for me but what keeps pulling me back there other than some of the best audiences this planet has to offer is the countless genius comedian friends I have there of which I include Nick without hesitation. I often like to see comedians as gun fighters because of the fearlessness with which they have to stare down threatening beasts.</div>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have been a fan of Eleanor Tiernan since I first worked with her in Dublin many years ago. Since then I have worked with her in London, Chicago and Edinburgh and my strong feelings about her brilliant comedy only gets reconfirmed every time I see her perform. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This past October 2014 I worked with her again in Galway at the Galway International comedy festival. She was doing a shot called the 'National Therapy Project' in which she gives the entire country of Ireland and the entire race of Irish people a therapy session so that they can forgive themselves for past guilt and real or imagined transgressions that have been inflicted upon them. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I loved this show but as I stated earlier I am biased because I love her and think this concept for a show was as joyous of a ride ride as you will ever experience in a comedy or theater festival performance. Even as I type these words her star power is increasing to its brightest wattage and if you are a fan of great comedy and don't know who Eleanor is then you will be pleased to get to know her further here now and see why I am such a believer in her and her comedy.</p>

Jesse not only performed on that show but he was also the main writer for Dave who helped him shape his monologues for that show. I next saw and worked with Jesse when I did @midnight for Comedy Central. Jesse is one of the main writers for @midnight and his comedy writing talents are in great demand. In this conversation we talk about the joys and benefits of not drinking and the many great comedians who have perished or risen above dying by the sword of booze.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I think of Andy Andrist I am reminded of a Bob Dylan quote "Never give anyone a hard time because you don't know what they have been through or what burden they may be carrying."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Andy at one of Doug Stanhope's desert parties and admittedly Andy was whacked out of his skull on psychedelic mushrooms at the time. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We recount this story in this conversation because I was greatly annoyed by Andy at the time. Now looking back it is very comical as to why he was annoying me but that is the thing with drugs, while you are on them you have no idea of the amount of people that you are irritating. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Since then I have gotten to know Andy much better and the incredible life journey he has been on and what it took for him to heal from the heinous experiences of his childhood. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Andy is one of the best friends of Doug Stanhope and it was Doug who was instrumental in helping Andy confront the man who had committed the heinous acts against him that rob him of his childhood innocence. I have come to know Andy very well in the years since we first met and he is the kind of comedian that I love to be around because his is not always "on" and when he does say something funny, it from out of nowhere and is always sharply a direct hit. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Last year in Las Vegas, he and I were on Doug Stanhope's podcast when someone mentioned that hippies don't go to Las Vegas. Andy said "That is because you can't gamble with vibes." That line still cracks me up. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded last summer when I had a week off between shows in San Francisco and Portland.  Ashna and I took a leisurely drive up the California coast into Oregon to enjoy the great Northwest. We stopped off in Eugene. Oregon where Andy lives and he stopped by our hotel to say hello and record this conversation. Eugene, Oregon is a lovable enclave of intellectual learning and is one of the most livable places in America. As for the guest of this episode, you will rarely find a person with more strength of mind, strength of character and who can cut your heart out with a precisely placed funny line and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Andy Andrist!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Ophira Eisenberg is one of the most lovable human beings and powerful performers I have ever met in all my years in entertainment.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is the darling of NPR, being heavily involved in their successful story telling series The Moth and she also hosts the weekly NPR game show Ask Me Anything.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Because of these sterling credits I had expected her to be more of a story based performer, but even though her personal stories do pop up in her live performances I was blown away by her stand up comedy skills and how hard she throws down her comedy thunderbolts. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Ophira briefly last summer in Amsterdam when I finished my week at Toomler and she was just arriving to do hers. Even slightly jet lagged her ebullient personality shined brightly and I liked her instantly. This past weekend we were both doing the Aspen Laff Festival in Aspen, Colorado. There were brilliant comedians galore and the camaraderie was tight with all of us watching each other's sets and enjoying our time together performing at the Wheeler Opera House. I was happy to get to know Ophira and to laugh at her battle tested tales of a life fully lived. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is originally from Calgary, Alberta, Canada but now makes her home in New York City. She is someone I would love to do anything with, be it touring together, working together on a project or just hanging out playing Scrabble. She has a quick wit that is always ready to stab you with a punchline and an easy infectious laugh that is as pleasing as it is calming.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If you are unaware of her presence on this earth, after listening to this conversation you will like her as much as I do and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Ophira Eisenberg!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Richard Leiby is one of the most respected journalists in the United States. He was one of the first reporters to write about Scientology in the 1980s and he has covered the Iraq & Afghanistan wars. For several years he was the bureau chief in Pakistan for the Washington Post. He is now senior writer and editor Style Section of the Washington Post where he has worked for nearly 25 years. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have been friends with him for exactly 20 years now, we met at the first HBO Aspen comedy festival in February 1995 and he also wrote about me and my Dad in April 1995 when I made Viva Vietnam! for Comedy Central and that special premiered in Washington D.C. He is one of the wise Buddhas in my life who I can go to to decipher the chaos of world events or if I need a source of higher world knowledge.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We have gotten together every year when I come to D.C. with the exception of those few years he was based in Pakistan. With all of the heart wrenching world events happening lately it was a perfect time to sit down with him and talk about events and the workings of modern journalism. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was recorded at the Washington Post on a brutally cold February afternoon but it contains the warm glow of two decades of friendship. He is his own library of Congress possessing oceans of valuable information and he is one of my oldest dearest friends whose opinion on important matters I greatly cherish and that is why it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Richard Leiby!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Paul Provenza is a true Renaissance man of comedy.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Having gain worldwide critical success for his film the Aristocrats, the history of the world's dirtiest joke, he went on to create and star as the host of the comedy cult classic series the Green Room. Then if that wasn't enough to solidify a career he thereafter co-produced the show Set List, where comedians go onstage with nothing prepared and are given their set list on the spot to see what they can invent.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Paul is a philosophical good hearted dreamer who has lived in Venice Beach, CA for 30 years. This past year when I have come to LA I have been staying in Venice Beach. We recorded this on a Saturday afternoon in February in Paul's living room, as much as I always enjoy talking with him this recording has the added bonus that I could see the waves of the Pacific ocean crashing over Paul's shoulder.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is currently directing Kelly Carlin in her one woman show about her life and being George Carlin's daughter. I had seen the show 2 nights earlier and asked Paul if we could record this conversation. We talk about how doing comedy and seeing comedy is a defiant act now since world news attacks on humor, we talk about how people are seeking authenticity now because they are fed up with the bullshit they have been spoon fed for so long. We talk about the slaughter at Charlie Hebdo and the geopolitical corporate powers won't let us hear alternative Muslim voices because they need to convey a clear enemy in their propaganda.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">I love Paul because whenever I talk to him it's never not lofty and seeking world turmoil solutions. He is a comedy legend, a brilliant human being and I am proud to present to you now the one and only Paul Provenza!</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Brent many years ago when he was starting out in San Francisco. He is always exciting to watch because you never know where his premises for jokes will come from. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was also at the Edinburgh Fringe festival in 2014 and I got to see him destroy the intelligent European audiences.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Not since Gutenberg's printing press has one human being's inventions improved the quality of life for people as much as Apple co-founder and principle creator Steve Wozniak. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Steve last month when he came to my show in Lake Tahoe. Fortunately for me the Woz loves jokes, humor and comedy in general so after sending him several heart felt e-mails requesting to chat with him he agreed, so last week while I was performing in San Francisco I drove down to Cupertino to record this conversation while him. This conversation was recorded at the Mandarin Oriental restaurant where Steve asked me to meet him. There is pleasant violin based classic music playing in the background because the owner politely delinked my request to turn off the music. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Steve Wozniak is not only a creative genius who has improved human life more than any other human being in the last 300 years, he also loves and cherishes humor and the story tellers who create the jokes. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Steve last month when he came to my show in Lake Tahoe. Fortunately for me the Woz loves jokes, humor and comedy in general so after sending him several heart felt e-mails requesting to chat with him he agreed, so last week while I was performing in San Francisco I drove down to Cupertino to record this conversation while him. This conversation was recorded at the Mandarin Oriental restaurant where Steve asked me to meet him. There is pleasant violin based classic music playing in the background because the owner politely delinked my request to turn off the music. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Steve Wozniak is not only a creative genius who has improved human life more than any other human being in the last 300 years, he also loves and cherishes humor and the story tellers who create the jokes. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">John Cooper Clarke is quite possibly the coolest human being walking the earth and performing on it's stages today. He is the English language's premier punk rock poet who started out in his verbal vocation in the late 1970s performing in clubs with the Sex Pistols, The Buzzcocks, Elvis Costello and Joy Division. For a brief period he lived with Nico from Velvet Underground. He invented the street where street credibility is earned and received. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met John in Edinburgh during the Fringe festival in 1999. I went to see his show with Greg Proops and Greg's wife Jennifer. They knew John Cooper Clarke and we all got to hang out together drinking and laughing all night. I have been quoting for years some of the whip crack smart lines I heard John perform that night. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Cut to October 2014 and I am doing the Galway International comedy festival with John Cooper Clarke and we got to rekindle our friendship and get back to our main business of laughing and joking all night. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Born in 1949 he is getting up there in age which makes it even more powerful that he is playing to sold out rooms full of young people hanging on his every word and screaming their heads off with laughter. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is the personification of cool and his poems always pack a punch that make you howl with laughter. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is the man that I want to be when I am older, he's got style, a love of life and and an impeccable style of dress. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In November 2014 he came to Los Angeles to film a music video for MacArthur Park and I got to hang out with him for a few days while he was in town staying at the London hotel for his first paid work visit to Hollywood.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I'm proud to call him a friend and you will be happy to know him too if you are unaware of his existence. He is historically important to performance art, comedy and spoken word performance and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only John Cooper Clarke.  </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Louis Katz in December 2013 when we were both filming Dave Attell's Comedy Underground for Comedy Central in New York City. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I was impressed with his punching power and how offbeat his topics were. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Like a freight train out of nowhere this peaceful looking guy was coming out with dark twisted melodramatic heroic tales in his joke premises and I found it as refreshing as some people do with watching sunsets with cold Pacific winds.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Louis was raised in Los Angeles, started doing comedy in San Francisco and now lives in New York. I have bumped into him several times in the past year and fate kept pushing us together to sit down and record this conversation. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I think it is perfect to release this now during the harshest point of dark winter because this was one of my most sunny happy moments of last summer.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Of course while we recorded this chat LA police helicopter circled overhead several times and at one point a neighbor dog starts barking mad.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is an audio taste of real life Los Angeles in the background of a conversation loaded with life's greatest wisdom...

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">And how the answer to it all is big brown bulbous ass! </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is one of the most refreshingly dark and twisted comedians I have met in many years and if I am anywhere near when this man is introduced I while be in the back of the room hotly anticipating what will come out of his mouth next.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If comedy were boxing I would rank Paul Ogata in the top ten of the all around, pound for pound, heavy hitters. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first bonded Paul when we did Beerfest in Singapore together years ago. Beerfest is one of the funnest experiences you can plan for yourself on a visit to Singapore, with it's outdoor music and beer tents but as a comedian with loud music blasting through canvas it is one of the toughest gigs that only real pros could muster. Paul and I bonded over the toughness of those circumstances in Singapore, respected each other for not capitulating and have been close friends ever since.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Paul many years ago when we performed together in Honolulu. Paul grew up in Honolulu and has a Hawaiian laid back chill that makes you think he is mild mannered until he gets on stage and rips the heads off of people with his superior jokes. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Paul is huge in Hong Kong, Sydney and some places in the US but he is one guy I believe in and know it is a matter of time before the rest of the world finds out about him. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His humor is accessible on so many levels from his punchlines always pack a kick. He is one of my favorite human beings and he has been around paying his dues getting banged up and proving himself in battle that when his star does one day soon pop you can know for a fact that this man earned his place in the world. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was recorded at the Safari Inn in Burbank, CA were they filmed scenes for the film 'True Romance'. He is a true Samurai master of stand up comedy and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Paul Ogata.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444;"><strong>Robert Hawkins</strong> is not only one of the funniest human beings alive he is also one of my dearest best friends. Robert is of those <strong>rarest creatures in that he is almost as funny off stage as he is onstage</strong>. I first meet Robert in the early 1990s when we were both playing at the River Center comedy club together in San Antonio, Texas. Robert was the MC, I was the middle act and Nick DiPalo was the headliner, what a show! </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444; min-height: 18px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444;">Robert is originally from Hollywood, Florida. I always love to say to him "You are so Hollywood... Florida." Because we both grew up in Florida we can always laugh about the unique and disturbing ridiculousness of our home state.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444; min-height: 18px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444;">He didn't start <strong>doing stand until he got out of the army</strong> in Texas so Texas is also a major factor in his life as is San Francisco as he and I both lived there at the same time. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444; min-height: 18px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444;">Career highlights aside from <strong>Conan</strong> appearances include being a writer for <strong>Christopher Titus' sitcom</strong> and for many years now he has been the <strong>opening act for Ron White</strong>. For me Robert will always be significant because he never fails to make me laugh and he has been a friend to me through thick and thin never once leaving me hanging if I were having troubles. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444; min-height: 18px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 15px; font-family: Helvetica; color: #444444;">Robert and Dan Gabriel were the ones who introduced me to Bikram Yoga in 2004 and we compare notes on that practice and talk about it at great length in this episode. "The best thing about Bikram Yoga is quieting your mind." In this conversation Robert and I talk about the Ice Cream Truck business we thought of starting, why should should pick your favorite team in the playoffs, the gold fish project of Amsterdam, family discounts in Thailand, why you should never have sex with a comedy club waitress on the first night of the week, why you should write and try out two jokes a day minimum and the most brilliant invention of all 'The Smoothie Phone.'</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">The day we recorded this, it was brutally cold rain with heavy winds outside.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;"><strong>Todd Barry</strong> is a perennial force of continuous head busting comedy for many decades now. The fact that Todd grew up in Florida and that he is one of the most respected comedians to have ever have started out there makes him feel like he is a part of my extended family. As long as I have been around, Todd has been around. From the earliest <strong>Comedy Central</strong> and <strong>MTV</strong> comedy shows to all of the best comedy festivals world wide. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has appeared multiple times on <strong>Letterman</strong> and <strong>Conan</strong>, as well as delivering highly acclaimed comedy specials. He is one of the most respected comedians in the business and Louis CK is one of his most ardent supporters, having highlighted Todd as himself as a reoccurring character on the smash hit FX show '<strong>Louie</strong>'.  </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Louis Ck even produced Todd's most recent live audio recording called '<strong>Crowd Work</strong>'. Todd's unique brand of comedy as well as his signature delivery has made him a staple on several animated series voicing characters on <strong>Dr. Katz</strong> and <strong>Squidbillies</strong>. Todd started doing stand up comedy in <strong>South Florida</strong> and moved to <strong>New York City</strong> where he still lives today.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">The day we recorded this, it was brutally cold rain with heavy winds outside.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Todd Barry is a perennial force of continuous head busting comedy for many decades now. The fact that Todd grew up in Florida and that he is one of the most respected comedians to have ever have started out there makes him feel like he is a part of my extended family. As long as I have been around, Todd has been around. From the earliest Comedy Central and MTV comedy shows to all of the best comedy festivals world wide. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has appeared multiple times on Letterman and Conan, as well as delivering highly acclaimed comedy specials. He is one of the most respected comedians in the business and Louis CK is one of his most ardent supporters, having highlighted Todd as himself as a reoccurring character on the smash hit FX show 'Louie'.  </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 16px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Helvetica;">Louis Ck even produced Todd's most recent live audio recording called 'Crowd Work'. Todd's unique brand of comedy as well as his signature delivery has made him a staple on several animated series voicing characters on Dr. Katz and Squidbillies. Todd started doing stand up comedy in South Florida and moved to New York City where he still lives today. This conversation was recorded at the Salt Hill Hotel in Galway, Ireland. Todd and I were both doing the Galway Comedy Festival together and this was the tail end of a European and Scandinavian tour he was on.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;">You are about to experience the creative power of Sananda Maitreya!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The man has been a hero of mine since he first burst onto the scene because I had read that he grew up in Florida and then went on to become an internationally renowned artist living in Europe and still tantalizing the world with his creations.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">With his last release of 'Return To Zooathalon' and his brand new release of 'The Rise Of The Zugebrian Time Lords' he is in my mind the JR Tolkien of Rock & Roll. Zooathalon is the paradise where we once trusted ourselves to be the masters of who we are. The Zugebrian Time Lords are trying to control your life and tell you who you are. As epic as this multilayered concept is, with it's metaphor of how in our modern consciousness and vanity you can be punished by being cast in a state of scrambled pixilation, I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression that these current recordings are not also packed with his ultimate strength of exquisitely articulated and soulfully expressed love songs.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have been a fan of Sananda Maitreya since he first hit the airwaves many years back recording under a different name. In the last few years as Ashna and I have dedicated our off time from touring to exploring Italy I found out that Sananda currently lives in Milan with his amazing wife, two young children and continues to record noteworthy epics. Last year I got to have him as a guest on Tom Rhodes Radio when he released 'Return To Zooathalon.'</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We recorded the conversation over Skype and I found him to be just as witty and charming as his writings that can be found at <a href="http://sananda.org/"><span style="color: #4787ff;">Sananda.org</span></a> so it was my mission this year to meet him face to face and record another episode.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We recorded this in his state of the art recording studio where he records all of his music and plays every instrument on those recordings.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It felt like going to Willie Wonka's chocolate factory and getting a personal audience with Willie Wonka himself. His kind eyes and easy humor instantly evaporated my hero worship and made me feel as if I had been friends with the man for years. It is impressive when you meet people who are solid examples of how to conduct business professionally. Not only was everything set up for us to record when I got there but a photographer was there to capture our togetherness but also a film crew recorded a multi camera shoot of it as well that can be viewed at <a href="http://youtube.com/SanandaMaitreya"><span style="color: #4787ff;">youtube.com/SanandaMaitreya</span></a> . </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was just the tip of the iceberg on the glorious day Ashna and I had with Sananda Maitreya and his glorious family. After this recorded he invited us over to his house for lunch where his wife cooked us a wonderful meal and we got to meet his two sons Elvis and Mingus. If seeing those two perfect joyful children doesn't make Ashna's ovaries start to knock then nothing will. Sananda invited me into his library complete with grand piano where we continued to talk endlessly about everything.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Seeing the titles of his books indicates what a lofty intelligent thinker this man is. Goethe, Balzac, Celine and other philosophers of heights I have yet to comprehend. By the time our evening together ended I felt like I was his blood brother and that I was saying goodbye to a relative. They say that you should never meet your heroes but in this case Sananda is the exception to that rule.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It was worth every Euro cent that it cost to get there and have this personal experience with a man that I have admired and appreciated for many years.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Kevin Meaney is one of my favorites because I will never forget watching him on television with my Dad and he made us both laugh out loud together. From then on my Dad would quote one of Kevin's jokes to me when he thought I might be on drugs "What are you hopped up on goofballs?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">To see Kevin Meaney perform today is to see him funnier than he has ever been.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If Depression, jail time and being stung by hornets can make you funnier in the retelling of those hard luck occurrences than Kevin is at the height of his powers and this episode is going to leave your sides hurting with laughter.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This year has been a tough year on Kevin Meaney especially with the shittiest moment being sent to jail for a misunderstanding at JFK airport when he was on his way to Israel to do shows. As much as I love him and feel terrible for what happened to him I can't help but howl with laughter and that is the gift of a great comedian.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">"You can't cry in jail, you have to be tough. You can't show fear in county jail."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He thought using the toilet in the open shared jail cell was his lowest moment until a school class trip came through to scare the kids by showing them how they shouldn't end up in life. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. I flew in a day early before I was to do a week performing at Brad Garrett's in Las Vegas. Kevin Meaney was closing out his week and I went to see his show that night.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Geechy Guy and Shayma Tash watched the show with me and after Kevin's show we all went back to my room to record this conversation. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is a man that I love very much as a human being. I wish that he would make a musical out of his jail experience. We talk about how depression is a serious medical condition and how the death of Robin Williams made him be more determined to be who he is. At all times through the toughest retelling of his pain he is lovable and hilarious and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Kevin Meaney! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Kevin Meaney is one of my favorites because I will never forget watching him on television with my Dad and he made us both laugh out loud together. From then on my Dad would quote one of Kevin's jokes to me when he thought I might be on drugs "What are you hopped up on goofballs?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">To see Kevin Meaney perform today is to see him funnier than he has ever been.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If Depression, jail time and being stung by hornets can make you funnier in the retelling of those hard luck occurrences than Kevin is at the height of his powers and this episode is going to leave your sides hurting with laughter.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This year has been a tough year on Kevin Meaney especially with the shittiest moment being sent to jail for a misunderstanding at JFK airport when he was on his way to Israel to do shows. As much as I love him and feel terrible for what happened to him I can't help but howl with laughter and that is the gift of a great comedian.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">"You can't cry in jail, you have to be tough. You can't show fear in county jail."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He thought using the toilet in the open shared jail cell was his lowest moment until a school class trip came through to scare the kids by showing them how they shouldn't end up in life. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. I flew in a day early before I was to do a week performing at Brad Garrett's in Las Vegas. Kevin Meaney was closing out his week and I went to see his show that night.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Geechy Guy and Shayma Tash watched the show with me and after Kevin's show we all went back to my room to record this conversation. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is a man that I love very much as a human being. I wish that he would make a musical out of his jail experience. We talk about how depression is a serious medical condition and how the death of Robin Williams made him be more determined to be who he is. At all times through the toughest retelling of his pain he is lovable and hilarious and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Kevin Meaney! </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Pete Johansson is someone I always love to run into because when I see him it always results in intelligent lofty conversation. He has never been one to waste his time on small talk chit chat as his brain has more value to offer and he has never been one to bullshit anyone. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Since I first met Pete we have had epic wine drinking evenings where we dissected the world's problems and laughed ourselves silly until the sunrise. He is a part of the Canadian comedy collective of what I consider to be Canada's finest comedians who make their home currently in London.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The philosophical nature of his comedy is why I am a fan of his work but it is his dedication to squeezing every drop of fun out of life is what attracts me to him as a friend. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was in Edinburgh for this year's Fringe festival where I got to spend many great nights talking and hanging out with him but we did not get to sit down and record this conversation until I was in London performing at the SOHO theater. As The Kings Of Leon sing about London "Those rainy days ain't so bad when you're the king." </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">One of the reasons I love to go to London other than the fact that it is one of the comedy capitols of the world is because of the brain nourishment I get from talking with genius friends of mine like Pete Johansson. He always tours worldwide as I do and aside from that he and I share a curiosity about life and attaining higher plains of love and consciousness. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Rich Hall is to comedy what Johnny Cash is to country music.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The man is a living legend, having won Emmys for his writing for David Lettermen, was on SNL and Not Necessarily The News, he invented his own language with Snigglets and he won the grand prize at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2000. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">For me personally, Rich Hall has been a great friend and someone I look up to who inspires me, especially with the amount of comedy ass he still kicks. Internationally respected and adored everywhere microphones are plugged in. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I filmed Viva Vietnam for Comedy Central years ago I could bring one writer with me and I chose Rich. We bonded in 'Nam baby! I've been to visit him in Montana 3 times and I would not know the unbridled glory that is Montana had it not been for Rich. After Rich moved to London he encouraged me to come over because  he thought I would do well there. Not only did he coach me on the right chess moves to getting in with London but for 5 years he let me keep a key to his phenomenal flat on Fitzroy Square. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">From London I got to springboard to the world so it is safe to say that all of the amazing life I have got to lead might not have happened had it not been for my friendship with Rich. Not only have I been inspired to watch him work and see where his career path choices have taken him but he has also been kind of a wise Buddha to me. Or better yet he is Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Hank Williams and Lee Marvin to me. He is one of the heroes of my life and I am eternally grateful that in a world filled with so many full of shit people I made friends with Rich Hall and that our worldwide golden experiences together continue to multiply. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We recorded this conversation while we were both doing the Galway Comedy Carnival festival last month on a blustery cold grey day inside the Salt Hill hotel.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Amsterdam.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Sander Borst is the quintessential Dutch bad ass. He is one of my oldest friends in Amsterdam. I met him when I first came to Holland to perform at Toomler comedy club where he was a bartender.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was performing in a punk rock band called the Skidmarks when we met and we hit it off easily by talking about music together.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">After I moved to Amsterdam I had many great music experiences with Sander and The Skidmarks. He has been one of my best friends in the city and he has always been there for me through life's ups and downs. No one knows my personal history of Amsterdam better than him and I also know all that he has been through in his life and the different turns his music career has taken that led him to where he is today. As a man I respect him and the way he has always conducted himself as a human being. He is the strong smart handsome Dutch man hero of my book. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">After the Skidmarks came his hard rocking alternative country band called Check 1-2. Sander has given me each of his releases through the years just as I have also give him all my releases as they happen too. I'm a fan! </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I love his dedication to his music and the fun intensity he puts into each songs execution. I am a fan of every project he has committed himself to and the bands he has played in all have an end of the world, end of your life, going the have a good time if we have to wreck the place energy. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">After Check 1-2 He played in a swinging alternative country band called The Pedro Delgados. Because I want you to know his music, Sander has allowed me to take you on a musical journey through the course of this conversation. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Now he has infused whiskey thumping honky tonk into his musical equation and his current band is called The Leadbeaters. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation we talk about his music, our friendship, peculiarities of Dutch culture and why telling a Dutch person I love you produces suck awkward reactions. This episode is about me introducing you to my friend's music that has happily been playing in my eardrums but is also about celebrating friendship. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is one of the truest friends I've ever had and it is my pleasure to present to you the one and only Sander Borst. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Galway, Ireland</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Reginald D. Hunter many years ago in Manchester while hanging out with a group of comedians. It was before he became the comedy superstar that he is today. I liked him when we met so I have been cheering him on through the ensuing years when I saw him on countless British panel chat shows. Because he is from Georgia I felt Southern comedic pride watching him rise and it made me think that I knew him better than I actually did. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Last month we were both in Galway, Ireland to do the Galway Comedy Carnival and it was the first time we got to sit down and talk one on one. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He left his home in Georgia and headed to England many years ago to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic acting. After graduating he started his comedy career in England and as a result he is a much bigger star in the far reaching signals of the BBC than he is on American television. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Reg is an American original subversive thinker and he is a true master of stand up comedy.  In his own words "I want to represent the people who want to have intelligent discourse." Or "I decided a long time ago that I wasn't going to coon on television." I was happy that I got to see Reginald perform several times in Galway. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It was harsh cold wind and rain while while we were in Ireland and it was a perfect comedy festival to stay inside and talk with your friends. His spiritual wisdom and Southern charm will light up any grey day and his advice to comedians is among the best yet given on this program.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">"Seriousness is like arthritis for a comedian." Or "You are there to be laughed at. So check your ego at the door (via Tony Woods)." Also "Words are powerful. Enjoy saying them. Lean into them." He is a man that I'm honored to get to know better in this conversation and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Reginald D. Hunter!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Las Vegas.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I want to pay tribute to the Amazing Johnathan before he drops dead.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We all avoid the thought of death and superstitiously try to avoid the topic but that dirty whore will strike each of us. The Amazing Johnathan has a heart ailment and his doctors have told him that if his medicine doesn't work he only has one year to live.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Imagine what you would do if you were told you only had one year to live.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">After years of touring relentlessly he wants to stay at home, maybe buy a new big screen TV, maybe do heroin, maybe a demolition derby in his back yard?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I drove into his swank neighborhood, gated community with plush lawns and green trees in Las Vegas. Rich people can make it green anywhere. His house is a large sparkling palace with classic cars parked all over the front yard and back. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The 17 year old boy in me can't help but smile to see sitting in his drive way a 1967 midnight blue convertible GTO. His tasteful home has been modified to his specifications and every painting in his house has a trick or joke function hidden that can spring forth at his command. His opulent home is exactly the way you would dream Amazing Johnathan's house would be or a mad scientist with a wicked sense of humor. I'm impressed to see the life that he made for himself and I'm proud of him for being one of the few comedians who was smart with his money.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He earned it! Going from comedy club headliner to doing countless television appearances he opened up The Amazing Johnathan Theater in Las Vegas and his ominous presence could be felt advertised everywhere in the city during his decades run. I would credit Amazing Johnathan with being right at that turning point in Las Vegas history where it went from being a sad joke to the cool upgraded spot it is today. George Carlin was a fan of his and once left him a long complimentary message on his answering machine. He listens to it when he gets depressed he tells me. He attributes everything he has to drugs. He tells me the best and worst times he had on drugs. He is open with me and honest about his lunatic partying days. He tells me that dying is a lazy way to get compliments.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met the Amazing Johnathan doing comedy festival and television tapings and we have been friends from sharing those experiences. Our mad men party periods never met and I only knew him in a professional way that I respected. His comedy for lack of a better description I would call rock & roll comedy magician but whatever you would call it the man always hit the stage like a hurricane with jokes coming at you from everywhere. For me personally the reason I love the Amazing Johnathan is because when I was a young comedian watching every stand up comedy show on television while dreaming of getting there myself that is when I saw him for the first time. Destroying the audience on television and me at home.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was unlike all the other stiff, cookie cutter style comedians, he had his own style and his magic tricks involved fake blood and his eye popping out. Crazy shit! I loved him for his wildness and I respected him before I ever even met him. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Hamlet holds the skull of a comedian and he laments the fact that such a magic human who had made him laugh so hard is no longer of this earth. I ain't Hamlet and I ain't waiting until the man is dead to say how much I appreciate him. This tribute episode is not meant to be sad, it is meant to be alive and celebratory. For this reason I end the episode with a song I love instead of some sad sappy shit. The man left his mark on American entertainment and world wide comedy. I'm grateful that I know him and that he invited me over to his house to have this conversation with him.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Amazing Johnathan!</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I want to pay tribute to the Amazing Johnathan before he drops dead.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We all avoid the thought of death and superstitiously try to avoid the topic but that dirty whore will strike each of us. The Amazing Johnathan has a heart ailment and his doctors have told him that if his medicine doesn't work he only has one year to live.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Imagine what you would do if you were told you only had one year to live.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">After years of touring relentlessly he wants to stay at home, maybe buy a new big screen TV, maybe do heroin, maybe a demolition derby in his back yard?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I drove into his swank neighborhood, gated community with plush lawns and green trees in Las Vegas. Rich people can make it green anywhere. His house is a large sparkling palace with classic cars parked all over the front yard and back. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The 17 year old boy in me can't help but smile to see sitting in his drive way a 1967 midnight blue convertible GTO. His tasteful home has been modified to his specifications and every painting in his house has a trick or joke function hidden that can spring forth at his command. His opulent home is exactly the way you would dream Amazing Johnathan's house would be or a mad scientist with a wicked sense of humor. I'm impressed to see the life that he made for himself and I'm proud of him for being one of the few comedians who was smart with his money.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He earned it! Going from comedy club headliner to doing countless television appearances he opened up The Amazing Johnathan Theater in Las Vegas and his ominous presence could be felt advertised everywhere in the city during his decades run. I would credit Amazing Johnathan with being right at that turning point in Las Vegas history where it went from being a sad joke to the cool upgraded spot it is today. George Carlin was a fan of his and once left him a long complimentary message on his answering machine. He listens to it when he gets depressed he tells me. He attributes everything he has to drugs. He tells me the best and worst times he had on drugs. He is open with me and honest about his lunatic partying days. He tells me that dying is a lazy way to get compliments.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met the Amazing Johnathan doing comedy festival and television tapings and we have been friends from sharing those experiences. Our mad men party periods never met and I only knew him in a professional way that I respected. His comedy for lack of a better description I would call rock & roll comedy magician but whatever you would call it the man always hit the stage like a hurricane with jokes coming at you from everywhere. For me personally the reason I love the Amazing Johnathan is because when I was a young comedian watching every stand up comedy show on television while dreaming of getting there myself that is when I saw him for the first time. Destroying the audience on television and me at home.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was unlike all the other stiff, cookie cutter style comedians, he had his own style and his magic tricks involved fake blood and his eye popping out. Crazy shit! I loved him for his wildness and I respected him before I ever even met him. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Hamlet holds the skull of a comedian and he laments the fact that such a magic human who had made him laugh so hard is no longer of this earth. I ain't Hamlet and I ain't waiting until the man is dead to say how much I appreciate him. This tribute episode is not meant to be sad, it is meant to be alive and celebratory. For this reason I end the episode with a song I love instead of some sad sappy shit. The man left his mark on American entertainment and world wide comedy. I'm grateful that I know him and that he invited me over to his house to have this conversation with him.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Amazing Johnathan!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><i>Intro song: Cutting Room (Hot Pants) – Oceanliners</i></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><i>End song: The Shouting Matches – Gallup, NM</i></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Los Angeles.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Eddie Pepitone is the darling of the underground comedy scene of Los Angeles. For an older man without a full head of hair to kick so much ass in the city where youth and beauty reigns eternal he must be respected for what he has accomplished.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His comedy style is the man yelling to the people who are in the house that is one fire but they cannot see that the house is on fire. He is the angry heckler in the crowd in the crowd who makes perfect sense. He comes from an emotional place as a comedian, he attacks the stage with how he feels. What fuels him now is what is happening in the United States with corporations destroying people. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Anyone who thinks American comedians never talk about anything substantial have never seen Eddie perform. In this conversation Eddie and I talk about how you stay aware of what is happening in the world while remaining sane. Like George Carlin, Eddie Pepitone is an example of how an older man can do his best work in comedy and continue as he ages because he has experienced more in life. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The documentary 'Bitter Buddha' that was about Eddie's life was a huge success. Acting roles continue to role in because he is such a unique funny character who brings his soul and experience to every project he takes part in. A veteran of two Edinburgh Fringe festivals, who I caught up with in Los Angeles just a few weeks after this year's festival. The show he performed this year was entitled 'Rest In Peace America' in which he celebrates the downfall of America and gives him a vent to steam about life in America today. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He loves the modern comfort's of today's technology but thinks it is an exercise in futility with us amusing ourselves to death. He believes entertainers live for fame and affirmation but says if you are not centered at your core the entertainment business will crush you like a bug. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We talk about Hollywood conspiracies, Obama's ineffectual presidency, the lack of gun control in the United States, best New York City film achievements, the collapse of the world economy and the best sources of information. He tells me his best ideas come to him when his brain calms down and he has personal break throughs. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this chat we talk about digesting information and ideas in order to spit out everlasting gobstobbers of thoughts. He is a man that I adore, respect and he makes me laugh out loud very hard. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in London.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Let it be known to the the universe that Tom Rhodes Radio gives Mark Farrelly's one man show 'Quentin Crisp' a 5 star review.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This show invites libation imbibement and encourages you to be yourself whatever you wish that self to be. Being exactly what you are even if that is a bore.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Mark was doing his Quentin Crisp solo show at the Gilded Balloon for the Edinburgh Fringe festival and I met him about half way through the festival's run at the Loft bar, the private bar for the entertainers and artists doing shows there. I had so many deep conversations with him over the last 2 weeks of the festival and I liked his show much I thought it an imperative that he be a guest on my show.  After our Edinburgh run we both went to London, me to do my show at the Soho theater and Mark to do his at the St. James theater.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">My wife Ashna and I went to see his show again in London and then we invited Mark over to have a few bottles of wine and record this conversation in our rented flat.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His show at the St. James theater was brilliant with the verve and excitement of live performance that Mark brought to his character and since it was in the evening with alcoholic beverages flowing each of the excellently written lines of dialogue hit their targets making the room explode with laughter. Mark told me he loved the message of Quentin Crisp because it wasn't about being gay it was about being yourself.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation we talk about the harshness of criticism, the meaning of life and the most interesting people who ever lived. "Writing 87,000 reviews would never feel as good as giving one performance." In today's narcissistic society no one knows who they are and what to believe in. Quentin Crisp's life told by Mark Farrelly is one to gain inspiration from and peppered with Quentin's sharp quotes on life we are reminded of why Quentin Crisp is worth remembering.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">"We live in a pretty dreary world were most people don't even have the decency to be themselves." In this episode you will learn why it is our excessive freedom is what makes us miserable and why having personal style will cure you of your excessive freedom. He is one of the people who I enjoyed speaking with the most on my most recent visit to the Queen's British Isles. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Mark Farrelly!</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Rhys Nicholson is a star waiting to happen. He is visually captivating with his flaming orange read hair, thick black glasses, high cheek bones, chiseled jawline with powdered make up and his smart style of dress. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His comedy is frank, up front, straight forward, unabashed and unapologetic even when he talks about the details of his sex life. In his own words he told his Grandmother "Being gay is not all anal sex and dancing." He can be unsettlingly graphic on stage at times for normal puritan audience members but he always makes me laugh and it is his sincerity on stage that is my favorite thing about his style of comedy.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Rhys 5 years ago when we were performing together at the Comedy Store in Sydney, Australia. Back then you could see that he was destined to do great things as a comedian and it is enjoyable to me, someone who is cheering him on, to see the development he has had and where he is as a performer today.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This being his 4th Edinburgh Fringe festival he has more experience than me in some areas. I love him as a friend, a comedian and as someone I always easily have great conversations with. In this conversation we talk about the power of the pink dollar, how in Edinburgh people value stories above all else, the unnerving feeling of performing when children are in the audience, his hand made bow ties, his fondness for Argentinians and lamas. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is the Priscilla Queen of the desert of stand up comedy. He was born to be in show business and his side comments to himself are gems of performers inside jokes that anyone would laugh at feeling a part of the club. His Australian accent, personal style and self referencing humor subliminally encourages everyone to embrace their uniqueness and fabulousness just by sheer example of his being. He has many brilliant years ahead of him as a performer and I am one of his fans and friend that will be cheering him on all the way. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In my opinion Jo Caulfield has the sexiest speaking voice in all of the English speaking comedy world. Her tone, elocution and educated accent is one that makes me tingle like a comfort food and if I owned my own television network she would be the voice of my channel. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Jo when I first started coming to London in the late 1990s. I have worked with her many times through the years and I respect her not only because she has always been kind to me but because she is funny and has a certain authoritative way of carrying herself onstage.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I've always said that when a comedian steps onstage everyone else in the room should lose rank and title and that comedian should become the sheriff of the room while they have the microphone in their hand. That is one thing about Jo's style that has always impressed me, while she is onstage she is the sheriff of the room.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In recent years more women and ethnically diverse personalities have taken to comedy stages but going way back to when I first met here up until the present Jo has been someone, a female someone who has been slugging it out in a male dominated profession and busting heads in the comedy world. This business is an unforgiving one where only the strong survive and just the fact that she has remained at the top of the UK comedy performing world for so long is testament enough of her quality and a badge of honor not many people can claim to have achieved. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is a respected veteran with many television appearances and Edinburgh Fringe festivals under her belt. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation we cover many topics from her personal history to the British Empire's opium wars with China but perhaps the most valuable thing you will learn from her in this episode is the proper way to make English tea. She is someone whose voice, presence and thoughtful comedy always puts a smile on my face and it is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Jo Caulfield!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Lynn Ruth Miller is an inspiring risk taker who is attacking life as if she were someone 20 years old. Humbling to learn that she is 80 years old and just moved to Brighton, England last year to pursue her career as a stand up comedian. Born in 1933 she remembers the war years in a way that will surprise you and her opinion of America is ice cold honest from someone who survived much person disaster and incredible odds to be where she is today. Her charm and joy for life is infectious as it is captivating. She has many strong opinions former from a life fully lived. She doesn't believe in fear or evil and she believes that every dream is worth pursuing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I met Lynn Ruth 10 years ago when she started out as a comedian in San Francisco. She had come to see me headline at the Purple Onion then shortly after this she booked me to do a show with her at Stanford University which turned out to be a very special experience for all involved. Through the years I have seen her in San Francisco and other world wide spots where she pops up doing comedy in foreign countries like me. </p>
<p></p>
<p>"The woods would be very silent if the only birds who sang were the ones who sang best." Lynn Ruth is a veteran of nine Edinburgh Fringe Festivals and I was happy to see her and her show in Edinburgh this year while I was there.</p>
<p>She is like a relative to me, or rather someone I wish was related to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She stays in touch with me regularly and she is always popping up around the world cheering me on as I am with her. She is someone I always love talking to because she is filled with wisdom and insight aging from life lessons learned.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She is not afraid to chase her dream of being a comedian and I am inspired by her ruthless determination and the original energy of joy that goes into each performance. She is quit simply a gem of a human being and it is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Lynn Ruth Miller!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in San Francisco.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Margaret Cho when I moved to San Francisco in the early 1990s and because we both developed and came up together she is a friend that I am always cheering for and who I will always be loyal too. I could go for years without seeing Margaret but when we do it is like we never lost a minute together. I have been communicating with her for the past few years about trying to record an episode of this podcast with her but our schedules have not allowed us to make that happen. A few weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I asked Margaret if she would be in town and she said that she was going to go San Francisco for Comedy Day in Golden Gate park because this year it was dedicated to Robin Williams.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Because of Margaret I bought a last minute plane ticket to fly up for it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Comedy Day is a yearly free comedy concert in the park every year that the city of San Francisco puts on. I had not been to one since the late 1990s and neither had Margaret. It was so much fun to see so many old friends from the San Francisco comedy scene of the 1990s. Deservedly so Margaret is an adored icon and watching her being appreciated makes my heart happy. She is the perfect San Francisco comedian, raised in the city by book store owning parents, an intelligent, funny Asian woman who represents and defends the gay and lesbian community. Margaret has been busting heads in the comedy world for many years and not many comedians ever attain the universal love and appeal that she has.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was recorded the day after Comedy Day in Margaret's Union Square hotel room. We had enjoyed comedy Day immensely laughing our heads off together, my favorite moment was having Margaret sit right up front under the stage and scream her head off laughing at me. I also learned that she was very close to Joan Rivers and that she is still very tore up over her recent death. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Margaret and I also were both given our our sitcoms around the same time and they both only lasted for one season. My reaction to my sitcom ending was to plunge myself into drugs and alcohol but Margaret wrote a brilliant one person show called 'I'm the one that I want'. Seeing that show in New York City gave me great inspiration at that time when I needed it. Margaret's career has been so successful because she continuously works her ass off. In this conversation we talk about our sitcom experiences and the mountain of pressure you have on you when you are the star of your own network television show.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Margaret Cho has championed countless civil rights causes and has supreme knowledge on many different topics, especially stand up comedy. In this conversation Margaret tells me about Joan Rivers' funeral and the best laugh she had with Joan. We also talk about Korea and the Korean pop culture domination of the planet. I've been to Korea twice in the past 2 years and I'm excited for Margaret to go there just because it will produce another brilliant special for her. We talk about our immigrant mother's and Margaret tells me about her quest to learn the Korean language. She teaches me about the highlights of Korean cinema. The trilogy of movies 'Old Boy', 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She we had this talk I watched 'Old Boy' and I highly recommend this mind-blowing movie. Since the day I met her, Margaret has turned me on to cool things. She tells me about the Rue De Temple, the best place to shop in Paris. She gives me the best world wide travel tips she has learned and I tell her the importance of a successful comedian having nice luggage. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode happened because Margaret suggested that I come up to San Francisco at the last minute. After the joy of having this conversation we went to the panhandle and got stoned before she took me to a guitar store on Haight street. After the guitar store we ate fat gorgeous San Francisco burritos and then Margaret called me an Uber that took me to the airport. It was a perfect 24 hours in San Francisco and this episode is the result of this. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is the Joan of Arc Samurai warrior of comedy and it is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Margaret Cho!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in San Francisco.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Margaret Cho when I moved to San Francisco in the early 1990s and because we both developed and came up together she is a friend that I am always cheering for and who I will always be loyal too. I could go for years without seeing Margaret but when we do it is like we never lost a minute together. I have been communicating with her for the past few years about trying to record an episode of this podcast with her but our schedules have not allowed us to make that happen. A few weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I asked Margaret if she would be in town and she said that she was going to go San Francisco for Comedy Day in Golden Gate park because this year it was dedicated to Robin Williams.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Because of Margaret I bought a last minute plane ticket to fly up for it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Comedy Day is a yearly free comedy concert in the park every year that the city of San Francisco puts on. I had not been to one since the late 1990s and neither had Margaret. It was so much fun to see so many old friends from the San Francisco comedy scene of the 1990s. Deservedly so Margaret is an adored icon and watching her being appreciated makes my heart happy. She is the perfect San Francisco comedian, raised in the city by book store owning parents, an intelligent, funny Asian woman who represents and defends the gay and lesbian community. Margaret has been busting heads in the comedy world for many years and not many comedians ever attain the universal love and appeal that she has.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">This episode was recorded in Los Angeles.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Aisha Tyler is an iconic woman who has conquered the stages of stand up comedy, the world of network television and the New York Times bestsellers list of book authors.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I met Aisha Tyler in the 1990s in the golden age San Francisco comedy. I remember Aisha when she was starting out as a comedian there and I remember that she always had a pure heart in her pursuit of becoming a master stand up comedian.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I remember her hustling around the Bay area comedy scene trying to get as much stage time as she could and always trying to get better as a comedian. I felt like she was Luke Skywalker and I was Obi-wan Kenobi when she would seek out my Jedi warrior wisdom. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">She has always shown me respect and been grateful for my influence on her development.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">In this conversation we talk about how she felt like an outsider growing up in San Francisco, Finding your voice as a comedian, taking giants leaps in developing your material, the influence of the abundant about of humor her dad that affected the person she is today. The story she tells me in this chat about how before she would leave the house her dad would tell her to go grab the world by the balls hit me in my hilarity button. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">On her podcast Girl On Guy she has a segment called Self Inflicted Wounds. When I did her podcast I showed up with an entire bag of self inflicted wound stories. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Everyone has stories about how they were self destructive and if you rose again or not is the only answer to that story. Pain is intrinsic in the human experience and self inflicted wounds is such a great idea Aisha wrote a book on that topic called Self Inflicted Wounds which had a strong run on the New York Times best seller list and is currently in the talks to become a television show.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">In this talk we talk about the best laughs our fathers gave us and their most funny expressions.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">In this episode you will learn why you should eat the spotted owl, never leave anyone stranded on the side of the road and never leave anyone in jail. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Aisha went to Dartmouth University to study Environmentalism policy. Clean coal is a lie! Then she studied the economies of developing nations and lived in Kenya for a while. She is more than qualified to speak against rich white people.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Aisha has so much to tell the world and her intelligence makes it easy break down major issues to find the rational thoughts on our capitalistic society. There is blood on all of our hands!</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">We talk about the tangle mess America is in now and how corporations own our every move and how our system tramples people. Aisha is real and honest no matter if we talk politics or our personal lives. She believes in the transformative power of personal freedom and she is not afraid to squash modern topics by pushing it further. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">She is one of the stars of the daily network show The Talk speaking to millions of American homes everyday. As you will see in the conversation she is real and truthful about everything. She is so monumentally intelligent and magnificently charming and funny I wish she would love even more every entertainment outlet from TV, film, books, internet, etc.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">She is a deep thinker with a sharp perspective and the truest laugh. I’m proud of her for all of her success because she always had a good heart but also she inspires me because she is real in everything she does. She possesses the pearl of great knowledge and wisdom and it was a joy to record this rambling talk about everything. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Aisha Tyler!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Karen Koren is the queen mother of the Edinburgh Fringe festival. She has produced countless shows for the festival for over 30 years and it the operator of the Gilded Balloon, one of the cornerstone venues of the entire Fringe. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It was important for me to do my Edinburgh debut with Karen at the Gilded Balloon because of a disaster I had experienced at the old Gilded Balloon (which has since burned to the ground) at the perennial late night show Late n’ Live many years ago when I was visiting the festival in August 2000.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">That disaster and the notorious viciousness of Late n’ Live hecklers are discussed in the episode. Not only did I shatter that memory for myself I created the best possible new one from getting to perform my hour show every night at 9:15pm at the Gilded Balloon and be under the loving umbrella of Karen Koren. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">At the Loft bar of the Gilded Balloon where this conversation was recorded is the private bar for the performers of this venue who I bonded with, saw the shows of and hung out with until the wee hours of the morning. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Karen has created such a welcoming atmosphere at this excellently run venue. Not Only does she bring in the best quality performers but the people who ran her venue I had met at Comedy festival in Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Canada and France. Even her staff are of the highest quality in live festival comedy entertainment. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I enjoyed talking with Karen Koren every night, not just because she has the most dreamy hypnotic accent but also because of her gorgeous laugh. She helped to launch the careers of Alan Cumming, Eddie Izzard, Russell Brand, Tim Mincheon and Tom Rhodes.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I can’t say enough good things about this woman, she’s classy, she’s funny and she is wealth of comedy knowledge and history concerning British comedy and the Edinburgh Fringe festival.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She doesn’t bullshit anyone, she doesn’t beat around the bush and she has a strong opinion about the lack of substance from most American stand up she has seen. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Looking back on my memory of doing the festival this year I think of Karen and the lively and funny conversations we had together most every night. At times it felt like I had a mother figure looking out for me and I grew in her warm loving embrace. The people who book other world wide festivals when they spoke with Karen she insisted they should book me or be missing out on one of the best comedians in the world. She was constantly telling people to go see my show and raving about how funny I am. It would plaster the hugest smile across my face her every endorsement. Because of the incredible experience I just had in Edinburgh August 2014 and all of the friends I made there I am inspired to write my ass off to come up with a new hour of material. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I won’t go back too early with some watery shit, only hard hitting head cruncher jokes and stories because I would never want to disappoint Karen Koren by being any less than funnier than anyone else. I’m proud the hear in this conversation that her favorite part of my show was the real life stories where I wore my heart on my sleeve. She is the kind of person that if she likes you, you think “Well if Karen Koren thinks I’m great I must be pretty damn good.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">At this moment when I post this episode it one of the most important weeks in the history of Scotland because they get to vote whether or not they want to be an independent country or to stay joint with England. Either way, in England they like to yell “Long live the Queen! God save the Queen!”</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I just want it to be known that wherever I go in the world I will yell “Long live Karen Koren! God save Karen Koren!” It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Karen Koren!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Karen Koren is the queen mother of the Edinburgh Fringe festival. She has produced countless shows for the festival for over 30 years and it the operator of the Gilded Balloon, one of the cornerstone venues of the entire Fringe. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It was important for me to do my Edinburgh debut with Karen at the Gilded Balloon because of a disaster I had experienced at the old Gilded Balloon (which has since burned to the ground) at the perennial late night show Late n’ Live many years ago when I was visiting the festival in August 2000.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">That disaster and the notorious viciousness of Late n’ Live hecklers are discussed in the episode. Not only did I shatter that memory for myself I created the best possible new one from getting to perform my hour show every night at 9:15pm at the Gilded Balloon and be under the loving umbrella of Karen Koren. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">At the Loft bar of the Gilded Balloon where this conversation was recorded is the private bar for the performers of this venue who I bonded with, saw the shows of and hung out with until the wee hours of the morning. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Karen has created such a welcoming atmosphere at this excellently run venue. Not Only does she bring in the best quality performers but the people who ran her venue I had met at Comedy festival in Australia, New Zealand, England, Ireland, Canada and France. Even her staff are of the highest quality in live festival comedy entertainment. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In comedy there are certain wise men you meet on your journey that are priceless to talk with because they possess the glow of knowledge you hope to gain when you one day pass from warrior to wise man.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Tommy Sheppard owns The Stand comedy club in Edinburgh which is the heart and soul of Scottish comedy. It is as perfect of a comedy club to start in as the Cavern club in Liverpool was for the Beatles to start in. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Since opening the Stand in Edinburgh he has branched out and opened satellite rooms of The Stand in Glasgow and Newcastle. He is reputed to be an honest fair man in a business where sticking it to a comedian by undercutting his cash is often one of the occupational hazards. Comedians speak of him with respect and his employees show their loyalty by working for him for years. I was happy to meet Tommy and make friends with him this past month while I was doing the Fringe Festival.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Before going into the comedy world by opening his room in the 1990s he was a full time organizer with the British Labor party. After the Labor party decided to go in another direction ideologically he left politics and with his redundancy payment he put a down payment on The Stand comedy club.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This moment in human history is very exciting because next week Scotland has the vote to decide if they want to be an independent country away from the United Kingdom. After thousands of years of bloodshed and dying for this very concept, Scotland has the chance to do it now in a peaceful manner, without ever even firing one bullet. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Tommy Sheppard is an ardent and vocal supporter of Scottish independence and the person I sought out to explain it all to me and why breaking away from England would be the best option for his fellow countrymen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In tis conversation I quiz him on comedy, the Fringe festival and all things Scotland but the most valuable insight of all is his knowledge on this turning point in Scottish history where the dreams of ancestors long dead and forgotten will finally be realized next week on election day.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Zoe Lyons is one of the best performers that I saw at this year's Edinburgh Fringe Festival. I love her style, her energy, her pacing and her material. Often when you are seeing multiple shows in a day at the Fringe festival you will look at your watch during a performance and I'm happy to report I did not look at my watch once while Zoe was performing her show Mustard Cutter. I simply got lost in my enjoyment of her show. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Her and I have in common that she also has a Dutch wife and her insights on being married to a Dutch person made me howl with laughter. Her facial expressions as well as her way of expressing how she feels about the life that she is living is of the essence of what comedy is about. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I will now bestow the greatest compliment I could give any performer by saying that Zoe Lyons contains the original energy of joy. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Like all comedians, I'm sure she has experienced a bumpy road but her attitude towards life and performing comedy is what attracted me to her soul as I sat among the audience watching her perform and why I wanted to highlight her on my podcast. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She lives in the artistic hub of Brighton and is a respected veteran of the UK comedy scene, she is one of the people I enjoyed hanging out with the most at the festival after parties and it must be said that I think she has the most glorious gap between her two front teeth. As a gap toothed person myself, I find that an irresistible trait in a fellow human. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Glenn Wool is one of the finest comedy exports Canada has ever produced. His comedy is philosophical, heartfelt and endearing. He is also one of the nicest human beings I have ever come across in all my years traveling the globe.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Glenn many years ago at the Comedy Store in London and have since worked with him at comedy festivals all over the world. He is one of the few comedians like myself that has relentlessly toured the world wide circuits proving that his comedy is accessible to laughing brains anywhere comedy microphones are plugged in.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has recently secured a home in Vancouver but that will undoubtedly not stop him from continuing to tour the world circuits. His take and opinion on subjects is always fresh and uniquely his own which makes him one of my favorite comedians to watch. He is also the kind of friend that if we are anywhere within a few hundred miles from each other we always make the extra effort to get together. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Impressively he is a veteran of 16 Edinburgh Fringe festivals and one of the hottest tickets in town when he is there. This conversation was recorded at my kitchen table of the flat in Edinburgh that I rented for Edinburgh Fringe 2014. We sat down over hot tea to talk about life, comedy, travel, festivals and every other pertinent topic that came to our brains until it was time for both of us to run off to our shows that night.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Glenn Wool!</p>

In July of this year we worked together again at Toomler comedy club in Amsterdam the week before we both went off to do the Edinburgh Fringe festival. Sharing an apartment together in Amsterdam I was privileged to see Hannah tightening up and putting the finishing touches on what would be her Edinburgh show this year, which made the experience of seeing her finished product at the festival even more enjoyable for me.</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">★★★★★</b><b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">  </b><span style="color: #000000;"><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Tom Rhodes Radio </b>Review<b style="line-height: 1.5;"> </b>for <strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Lucie Pohl</strong></span><span style="color: #424242;"> in </span><b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">‘Hi, Hitler!’</b></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Tom Rhodes Radio give the show 'Hi, Hitler' by Lucie Pohl a 5 star review! This show is so fast paced, character driven and funny that I saw it twice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">The eye catching title of this show comes from the adorable tale of how Lucie Pohl as a child thought the Nazis were saying hi to Hitler and not heal Hitler.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Is it possible to make Hitler adorable? Lucie Pohl can! She even drew Hitler innumerable times as a kid and wanted to go as Hitler for carnival but that kind of action is illegal in Germany where she was born. Her show is the story of her life and it is greatly influenced by the New York style of one person shows that I hold sacred like Eric Bogosian's Sex Drugs & Rock & Roll and John Leguizamo's Freak. Expertly performed Lucie Pohl keeps you captivated as her story pops from one scene of her life to another. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">As a child loving David Hasselhoff in her native Germany, her successful father moving her family to New York City, having artistic parents with dramatic lives living in Greenwich Village, her moving back to Germany to pursue her dream of acting, getting her knees skinned up from a bad romantic choice to finding love on a beach in Greece on the island of Rhodes. With magnanimous charm she plays all of the characters in her life and the journey she has experienced up to this point. </p>

She is a delight on every level and an artist I hope never forgets that making solid one hour performances is the glue that holds all of show business together. It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Lucie Pohl! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Lucie Pohl</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;"><b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">★★★★★</b><b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">  </b><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Tom Rhodes Radio </b>Review<b style="line-height: 1.5;"> </b>for Lucie Pohl in <b style="color: #000000; line-height: 1.5;">‘Hi, Hitler!’</b></p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Tom Rhodes Radio give the show 'Hi, Hitler' by Lucie Pohl a 5 star review! This show is so fast paced, character driven and funny that I saw it twice.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">The eye catching title of this show comes from the adorable tale of how Lucie Pohl as a child thought the Nazis were saying hi to Hitler and not heal Hitler.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Is it possible to make Hitler adorable? Lucie Pohl can! She even drew Hitler innumerable times as a kid and wanted to go as Hitler for carnival but that kind of action is illegal in Germany where she was born. Her show is the story of her life and it is greatly influenced by the New York style of one person shows that I hold sacred like Eric Bogosian's Sex Drugs & Rock & Roll and John Leguizamo's Freak. Expertly performed Lucie Pohl keeps you captivated as her story pops from one scene of her life to another. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">As a child loving David Hasselhoff in her native Germany, her successful father moving her family to New York City, having artistic parents with dramatic lives living in Greenwich Village, her moving back to Germany to pursue her dream of acting, getting her knees skinned up from a bad romantic choice to finding love on a beach in Greece on the island of Rhodes. With magnanimous charm she plays all of the characters in her life and the journey she has experienced up to this point. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Her show is so enjoyable you can't help but think why isn't this woman a superstar actor by now but we should be grateful because superstar actors never give us brilliant one person performances like this rooted in the very fabric that makes theater great and greatly inspiring.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I moved to San Francisco in 1991 openly gay comedians did not play at the regular clubs in the city, they performed at Josie's cabaret and juice joint in the Castro. It was at Josie's that I first saw Scott Capurro perform. He stood out among all the other comedians that night because he made my sides hurt with laughter. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It was only a few years later Scott would be the first openly gay comedian to bust through the barriers of the regular club scene there. He was like the gay Jackie Robinson busting down the door for all the other gay comedians who would eventually be able to work the regular rooms. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Scott's comedy has always been dark, twisted and controversial just the way I like it. I once had an interviewer ask me of those years in the 1990s when I lived in San Francisco "Did you know you were a part of history when it was happening?" The answer is "No." I just was enjoying my friends killing audiences and getting inspired by them to lift my game higher by always bringing my best. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">For many years Scott has lived in London and is a veteran taking part in his 17th Edinburgh Fringe Festival. He has stirred up controversy and created many firestorms from crafting his thoughts into jokes at this festival. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We talk about his years of doing Edinburgh Fringe, his life in London and the tragic passing this week of Robin Williams, who Scott costarred with in the movie Mrs. Doubtfire. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Just recently has Scott reappeared in my life and I have to say that I have missed him. He is never lazy in creating his material for the stage and never one to back down from bringing out thoughts that upset more conservative tastes in the audience. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">To me he is more than just a gay comedy icon, he is a friend who I respect greatly and a performer I love to watch crushing the bugs of prudishness. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Scott Capurro!</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Andrew Maxwell is the kind of guy who you would want on your side in a debating hall, on the football pitch or in a barroom fistfight. Andrew is one of the few human beings that tickles the living shit out of me just to hang out with him. He is a street fighting man originally from Dublin, Ireland who has lived in London for the past 20 years. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met him 15 years ago at the Comedy Store in London and he has since gone on to be one of the greatest friends I have ever known. He is one of my favorite people to stay up all night with laughing and talking about everything that comes to mind. His brain is packed with vital information concerning life, history and the general Ninja secret of high level comedy performance. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is an exciting performer to watch because he never backs down from the challenging remarks he offers on any topic and his television specials are made with great intelligence equally his great humor. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Greetings from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival! </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">At a later date I will talk about my personal history with this festival but for now I want to tell you about the magnificence of the biggest and greatest arts festival in the world. There are literally thousands of shows happening here on all manner of topics but the one thing that all of them share is that they each belong to the family of storytellers. I have been racing around the city as much as possible taking in as many different shows as I can and one of the shows I have loved most and that knocked me out is 'Circumcise me' written and performed by Yisrael Campbell.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is the story of his life and how he went from growing up Catholic in suburban Philadelphia to being an orthodox Jew living in Jerusalem. As is pure in every hero's story it was a bumpy ride to reaching the top of his spiritual journey. Yisrael is a reformed alcoholic, philosophical sage and stand up comedian with clear eyes discerning the continual crisis Israel faces and how best to deal with tragedy when it strikes your life. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first encountered the bright light of his personality after my first show of the festival run that he attended. I enjoyed his show 'Circumcise me' so much that I went to it twice. I laughed, I cried and stood on my feet clapping wildly when it finished. His story is epic how he became the person that he is today and I would much rather watch a film about his life instead of another dull super hero sequel.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Until then we have his show and this conversation about his life's journey. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival review's are very important so let it be known that Tom Rhodes Radio gives 'Circumcise Me' 5 stars! 5 Bravos! and 5 Hallelujahs! </p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">(5 stars are the best you can get on an Edinburgh review) If you are in or anywhere near Edinburgh during his run I highly recommend you put this show on the top of your list of must see shows. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Yisrael Campbell!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">A few weeks ago I performed at Helium in Portland and Lucas Molandes was my feature act. Lucas is from Austin, Texas. Austin is a spiritual center of edgy original comedy and Lucas decided to take the trip West with two other Austin comedians, Ramin Nazer and Sara Reihani.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">The set up showcase sets in California and other gigs around the North West. They called it 'The Good Grief' tour and I got to do shows with them in Salem, Oregon and Arcata, California on my drive back to San Francisco after my week in Portland.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">While I was in Portland I wanted to watch the World Cup final somewhere cool and Ashna found The Kennedy School. The Kennedy School is a former elementary school that has been turned into a hotel, cinema, bar, restaurants. This conversation was recorded in the back courtyard of the Kennedy School on a lovely July evening the day after the World Cup final and our week together at Helium.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I respect any young comedian who invests in themselves and takes a chance to expand his horizons by trying to do comedy in far away places, to take a chance on yourself to show people what you can do so they book you in the future.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">That is why I respect Lucas, Ramin and Sara for taking this journey West.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">The best souvenir of any trip is the memories you create and these 3 great friends are in the middle of a trip they will talk about as long as they live.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Ramin Nazer has a new comedy album out now called 'You were funny too'. It is well worth your money to buy it and 2 of my favorite tracks are played in this recording. Remember to support all your favorite comedians on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. because numbers are important and the bean counters of this business look at things like that. Prepare to get fuzzy tingles in your heart as I present to you now Lucas Molandes, Ramin Nazer and Sara Reihani.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Nevada Rhodes not only has the best last name ever he is a one man volcano bursting with fabulosity. He is tall, blonde and muscular living in Seoul, Korea where he not only speaks fluent Korean he is also one of the stars of the long running hit Korean TV show 'Strange TV Surprise!' He also does stand up comedy and that is how I met him. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I love traveling and presenting to you the many beautiful lunatics I know all over the globe but Nevada is not a lunatic, he is one of the sweetest, most sincere, loving human beings I have ever met. We recorded this on his rooftop garden in Seoul where two ducks and one chicken live among the bountiful array of plant life. He is like the heroine of a Disney animated cartoon the way he cares of all of the life sprouting on his roof and he also teaches Korean children about musicals.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He tells me that living in Korea he feels more free than he ever did in the United States. Of growing up in America he said "Being my fabulous faggotty self I learned from a very early age if you make people laugh they won't beat you up."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I am in Seoul I always have to stop by and see my friend Nevada because he allows himself to be fabulous which in turn allows others around him to be fabulous. It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Nevada Rhodes!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Jonathan Atherton built the comedy scene in Singapore and now he just opened the first full time comedy club in Kuala Lumpur called The Crack House.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When he first appeared on my podcast one year ago I got a tremendous response from people saying that thought he was the most interesting man in the world.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His stories about selling shoes to prostitutes in Kenya and smuggling gas into Uganda captivated me and anyone else who heard them. Now he has lived in Malaysia for one year and has just launched the Crack House comedy club.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If this podcast had a bigger budget I would have dropped confetti on his head. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this episode we talk about the disappearance of the Malaysian airlines plane,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">how he is not afraid to go off and party with angry Nigerians all night,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">the sad and untimely death of Vernon Lewis "Life is too short to die with bitterness in your heart." How Malaysian police are the best police money can buy, the crude humor that Australians are born with and how we could all learn from an ancient Hindu ritual and suffer more to psychologically elevate yourself of guilt.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is a man that I respect and admire because he forges much darkness with the light of laughter. Get yourself another big portion of the one and only Jonathan Atherton.</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Jonathan Atherton built the comedy scene in Singapore and now he just opened the first full time comedy club in Kuala Lumpur called The Crack House.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">When he first appeared on my podcast one year ago I got a tremendous response from people saying that thought he was the most interesting man in the world.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">His stories about selling shoes to prostitutes in Kenya and smuggling gas into Uganda captivated me and anyone else who heard them. Now he has lived in Malaysia for one year and has just launched the Crack House comedy club.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">If this podcast had a bigger budget I would have dropped confetti on his head. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this episode we talk about the disappearance of the Malaysian airlines plane,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">how he is not afraid to go off and party with angry Nigerians all night,</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">the sad and untimely death of Vernon Lewis "Life is too short to die with bitterness in your heart." How Malaysian police are the best police money can buy, the crude humor that Australians are born with and how we could all learn from an ancient Hindu ritual and suffer more to psychologically elevate yourself of guilt.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is a man that I respect and admire because he forges much darkness with the light of laughter. Get yourself another big portion of the one and only Jonathan Atherton.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>MinhHa Pham is a comedy superstar waiting to happen. She just needs a few more years of experience and developing material. Her love of comedy is pure and she is from the most unlikely breeding ground for comedians of Hanoi, Vietnam. I met her last year while I was performing in Hong Kong and she told me all about the new young comedy scene that is happening in Hanoi and it peeked my desire to return there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My Father flew helicopters in Vietnam, was shot down, survived, saved another soldier's life and was rightfully decorated as a war hero. I love my Dad and the topic of Vietnam was very dear to our family. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1994 I was one of the first Americans to go to Vietnam after the travel ban was lifted and I filmed an hour special for Comedy Central there called 'Viva Vietnam!" Since filming there I have always wanted to return and since it had been 20 years since I had been there I set up a show there on my next tour of Asia. Filming 'Viva Vietnam!" we went all over the country and Hanoi was my favorite place so for this visit I spent a whole relaxed week there. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Dan Dockery who owns the House Of Son Tinh is a beautiful lunatic from England who drove me all over the city at night on his motorcycle in the rain. Of all the great things I did that week nothing was more fun than the show I did at the House Of Son Tinh and MinhHa Pham opened the show for me. </p>
<p></p>
<p>She is young, attractive and likable so I knew she would do well on the stage but I was honesty blown away at how smart and funny her jokes were. She graduated from the university of Minnesota and started doing stand up comedy at Gotham comedy club in New York City 2 years ago. Now she is back living in her hometown of Hanoi forging this new art form and expanding her horizons while more stage time in cities around Asia. If she is this funny after only doing it for 2 years then I easily predict that she will be as massive as she would chose to be. It is a mighty claim but nonetheless you will be pleased to know such a person as MinhHa Pham exists. I am grateful to her for giving me the reason to return to a place that I loved and was deeply meaningful to me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This conversation was recorded at the Hanoi Social Club just a few hours before our show that night. As much as I love my new expensive killer microphone I think it may have been too good because of all the chaos of noise happening outside of our open air window. The streets sounds of Hanoi, car horns, scooter horns, communist propaganda loud speaker announcements, there were moments while we were recording that the city burst out with a plethora of crazy noises. That is the charm of Hanoi and you can hear it in full effect on this recording. It was blazing hot, the windows had no glass and Coca Cola on ice never tasted better.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is my pleasure to take you all the way to Hanoi in this episode and introduce you to the one and only MinhHa Pham!</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have only been friends with Duncan Trussell for a few years but he has already skyrocketed to the top of my list of people that I love hanging out with. We never talk about mundane topics like sports or weather, we always go to higher planes of love and consciousness as we do in today's episode that was recorded on a pleasant late Spring evening while we sat outside on Duncan's front porch.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation we talk about spirituality, the transformation of evil souls into good ones, neurological science and most bend bending of all is his theory that we are all unknowingly building a time machine for the future.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has his own podcast that I have appeared on twice called the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. I like how when we get together it is mental ping pong hitting ideas back and forth. When we get together it is wise to roll recording equipment and if the universe was balanced correctly he and I would already have a TV show together.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In the future if we are lucky every comedian will be more like Ted Alexandro.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Not only funny but passionate about knowledge and politically active.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I am a fan of Ted Alexandro because whenever I see him perform he is talking about things that matter and putting his unique opinion on world events.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is the kind of comedian I like the most in that he is the kind of comedian you learn things from, one that makes you see a topic from a different way you hadn't seen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He studied music and taught music before becoming a comedian and teaching seems to infuse most every act that he commits artistically.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He will forever be enshrined in the comedy history books for starting the movement that led to the New York City comedy clubs to raise the pay for comedians from the paltry 20 dollars a set they had paid for years. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Ted was heavily involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement from the beginning and it is not only a driving force in his life it reflects creatively in his comedy. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has a web series called Teacher's Lounge that stars many greats of American comedy. Ted is universally loved and respected. He is an exciting performer because anything could happen to him, be it film, television or the mind welding of our video future. I think he and his family should be studied scientifically so that more people can turn out just like him. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He studied music and taught music before becoming a comedian and teaching seems to infuse most every act that he commits artistically.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He will forever be enshrined in the comedy history books for starting the movement that led to the New York City comedy clubs to raise the pay for comedians from the paltry 20 dollars a set they had paid for years. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Ted was heavily involved in the Occupy Wall Street movement from the beginning and it is not only a driving force in his life it reflects creatively in his comedy. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has a web series called Teacher's Lounge that stars many greats of American comedy. Ted is universally loved and respected. He is an exciting performer because anything could happen to him, be it film, television or the mind welding of our video future. I think he and his family should be studied scientifically so that more people can turn out just like him. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is my pleasure to present to you the one & only Ted Alexandro.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">You may know Maz Jobrani as one of the founding members of The Axis Of Evil Comedy Tour. He has been referred to as the Persian Elvis. He has appeared in countless film and television roles but my favorite incarnation of him is as a stand up comedian.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I am a fan of his comedy because it contains the original energy of joy. His brand of comedy is not the slumped shoulders, down on your luck kind. His is a man in love with life and clearly enjoying himself onstage and that is what it is all about. In comedy, just like in real life it's all about having fun and enjoying yourself.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I also admire Maz's work ethic. When I am in Los Angeles I always run into him around town doing sets and working on new material. This conversation was recorded in his home where I met his beautiful wife and amazing children. In every form of media these days the negative gets high lighted and too much time is spent glorifying bitter turds. The fact that he is the complete opposite of an unhappy human is why I love him so much.</div>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in London.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Joseph Wilson when I performed at the Comedy Cafe in London in 2013.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">We hit if off instantly and unbeknownst to me he became a avid listener of my podcast. I found out he was listening to my podcast 6 months later when he was on vacation in Peru and sent me a video he filmed at the top of Machu Pichu where he recreated and slightly mocked the opening of my podcast where I list all the fabulous places in the world I am going to take the listener. I thought the video was funny and I was very flattered he filmed it in my honor. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This year when I got to London I got to hang out with Joseph a lot and get to know him better and today consider him a good friend. He is well dressed, has a theatrical personality, is an animated story teller and he is fun to be around. He currently holds the distinction of being the only comedian to appear on my podcast whose act I have not seen. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Even though I have stopped drinking I had a great time going out in London with him and discovering new watering holes in the Soho district that he took me to. For me personally any British person who wears top quality embroidered cowboy shirts with sincerity is a diamond geezer in my book. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">There are many reasons to love Joseph Wilson, first and foremost is the ease and comfort he can blast out hard core funny in a laid back conversation. It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Joseph Wilson.</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Very often in interviews I have said that getting in with London was the key to me getting in with all of these world wide comedy circuits, specifically me getting in with the Comedy Store. My guest today is Don Ward, the owner of the Comedy Store.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Since its opening in 1979 it has single handedly changed the British comedy scene from tired old pub comedians doing Mother in law jokes to the champions league of powerful original comedy that it is today. It is now an established institution of British comedy because every British comedy legend of the past 30 years has performed there. Don Ward is the visionary who made this work and who has witnessed the development and rise of these now household names, French & Saunders (Absolutely Fabulous), Eddie Izzard, Ben Elton, Jimmy Carr, Harry Hill and on and on.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The first time I ever did a set at the Comedy Store was in 1994. Then again in 1998 which led to me playing there regularly in 1999. In 2000 the Comedy Store started managing me for Europe while I lived in Amsterdam. You could say I had life by the balls back then and I was most certainly spoiled by being under the loving umbrella of the Comedy Store. Don Ward always treated me like a king and I always enjoyed speaking with him about comedy. I love and respect the man dearly. I love him like a relative in fact. Then I fucked up....</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I've been working on writing a book the past few years and I will go into more details there because in the story of my life Don Ward and the Comedy Store is an important chapter. The truth of the matter was that I was partying too much in London after shows and I frightened myself enough to decided to take a break on the place for a while when I moved back to the US in 2004. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I should have communicated with Don better about what was going on in my life. I owed him that. I owed him the respect her deserves so I wish I had been more honest with him. Needless to say feelings got hurt and it took me many years to mop up the mess that I had made. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I missed London and all my friends there so I just started going back a few years ago. One of my main reasons to go back was to set things right with Don Ward and apologize to him for me being such a schmuck. Last year when I was in London I went into Don's office and had the heart to heart talk with him. I told him since my Dad and my sister died I now see that the most important thing in life is the relationships you have with people. I told him how important he is to me, how I appreciated him treating me like a king and that I was ashamed and sorry over how I had disappeared on him. He could have rightfully told me to fuck off. Thankfully he welcomed me back to the Comedy Store and told me how that is all water under the bridge now. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode is very important to me because it was recorded between shows on Saturday February 22, 2014, the first weekend I have performed there in ten years. This episode is the end of a circle that took me ten years to get around to the other side of because of my mistake.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Never turn your back on the people who give you love and respect. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Don Ward is a living legend in the world of comedy because he has seen it all and presented the greatest comedians the world has every known. One day the British government will put a historical marker in front of the Comedy Store but until then we have the wealth of knowledge living in the museum of Don's mind. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in London.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Within the first 5 minutes I met Natalia Tena she was cracking me up and I was teaching her the basic steps of the tango.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I think she is a feminist icon badass woman. She is an amazing actress whose first role was in the Hugh Grant film 'About A Boy'. Since then she has had a sterling career staring in the Harry Potter films and in Game Of Thrones.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Most human beings would die content with those credits but not Natalia Tena!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is also the lead singer and creative driving force of the band Molotov Jukebox which just released their new album 'Carnival Flower'.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Her parents are from Spain so rhythm is naturally in her DNA, she told me that her aim is for people to go home and make love after her concerts.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Molotov Jukebox has performed all over the world inciting raucous ass wiggling good fun in it's path. Natalia Tena is a fearless shaman who leads the spiritual ritual of music, dancing and laughter at her shows and your life would be enriched to experience them. In the meantime you should purchase 'Carnival Flower' and make it a part of the fabric of your entertainment life. Her acting career continues to excite and she stars in the new independent film '10,000 KM' that is currently winning awards at film festivals all over the world. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Her accomplishments are a part of the pinnacles of modern entertainment but she is one of the most down to earth people you could meet. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">As a strong powerful woman she indisputably kicks truck loads of ass but most important to me is that she is wildly hilarious and hanging out with her is like hanging out with a comedian. You will be pleased to have her in your eardrums and to know that she is out there making the world a better place. It is my pleasure to present to you know the one and only Natalia Tena.</p>]]></description>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Virginia Gilbert is an award winning author and filmmaker. </div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">She is currently premiering her new film 'A long way from home' which she wrote and directed at film festivals all over the world. This conversation was recorded immediately following her showing of this new film at the Dublin film festival.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I met Virginia many years ago when I worked with her husband, Keith Farnan at the Laughter Lounge in Dublin. Since then they have become close friends.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I had been friends with Virginia for several years before I found out that her father was acclaimed filmmaker Brian Gilbert who made what I consider the greatest film about Oscar Wilde ever made with Stephen Fry in the lead role.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Virginia was a young adult helping her father on the set in Dublin and this experience inspired her to go to Trinity University in Dublin the same as Oscar.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">In this conversation we talk about the joys and sorrows of the film making process, her secret for inspiration when she is writing and how to embrace the spirit of Oscar Wilde.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">This episode is the embodiment of girl power because Virginia Gilbert kicks so much ass in her world and inspires me how she takes her creations of books and turns them into films. She is one of my favorite people to mentally joust with and to talk with about everything under the sun. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Virginia Gilbert.</div>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">There have only been a few of my comedy super star friends who when I asked them to appear on my podcast declined and then there is the opposite example of Stephen K Amos who when I asked him said "Of course, how soon can we record?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Stephen about 15 years ago when he was in his early years of being a comedian at the Comedy Store in London. I love everything about this man!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Aside from being one of the kindest souls I've ever met in the business, I love his style of dress, his flow of material as a comedian and the charming sucker punches of his punch lines. He deserves every drop of success he has gotten and I'm genuinely happy for him and his current elevation that he is flying at.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has done 11 Edinburgh one hour shows and has just come out with a book called 'Finding The Funny'. Currently hosts a show on BBC Radio called 'The Idiots Guide To Life' which I recorded a segment for at Stephen's request.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation he walks me through the steps he took to become the massive world wide comedy super star that he is today as well the triumphs and tribulations he has experienced in the years since I saw him last. He is one of those people who if I don't see him for years that when I do it's like we never lost a minute in between.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He never fails to make me laugh when we are together and as a comedian he has truck loads of wisdom to share from all of his life experiences.

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Paris, France.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Eve Jackson in June 2012 when I appeared as a guest on her TV program called 'The Culture Show' which airs on France 24, the English language channel of France. She was a fun and easy interviewer and I liked that she could roll with my answers injecting her wit into the conversation effortlessly.  She is the editor and primary journalist for art and culture happenings in Paris. I thought she would be an interesting guest because she knows everything that is happening for art and entertainment in Paris and also because she is usually the one answering the questions. I have stayed in touch with her in the past year and a half and I have enjoyed seeing the clips she has posted of her interviews with artists, musicians and movie stars that have graced her studio. Her journalistic path that led to her current reign at France 24 is an interesting tale and once a year she gets to hit the red carpet to interview all of the film industry people in attendance at the Cannes film festival.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I owe a great deal of respect and gratitude to Eve because of a huge blunder on my part that happened during this recording. She told me about how last year at Cannes she interviewed Woody Allen about his latest film 'Blue Jasmine' and when they got back to the editing studio they realized that her sound man had forgot to hit the record button. I thought to myself "What a boob! Who could screw something up that was that important." Then after an hour of conversation my computer went black because it had run out of energy and the entire recording was lost. My computer said it had 18% left but it went black nonetheless and I was rightfully embarrassed and deflated. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">The ever gracious Eve told me not to worry and come back later that night at 8pm to record it again. This is recording number 2 that we did later that night. It cost me 40 Euros each way from my hotel to her home 4 times, 160 Euros total. This is probably the most expensive episode I have ever created but it was worth every Euro cent because I think Eve is that interesting, fun and knowledgable.  It is my secret desire to make some type of entertainment talk show with her to be broadcast from Paris to the rest of the English speaking world. Aside from being a magnanimous charismatic human being, she is the kind of generous soul who would give a boob like me a second chance to record with her after screwing up monumentally. She is has an effervescent soul and knows everything there is to know about art, culture and entertainment in Paris today. It is my pleasure to present to you now the one and only Eve Jackson.</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Sebastian Marx the last time I played in Paris. He has the young hot new scene  putting on stand up comedy nights in English and in French. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">When I met him I came to see him perform a one hour show in French.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">He has lived in France for years and speaks French fluently. I didn't understand a word of the show but I was impressed to see an American speaking French and getting laughs. He is originally from New York with Argentinian parents. There are many reasons for me to love Sebastian Marx because he and I have so many things in common. Being American with a parental Argentinian connection, love of comedy, love of French culture, not afraid to live in Europe, etc.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">The upstairs room at the So Gymnase theatre is where I did my shows with Sebastian. It's an intimate cozy room with old couches and a low ceiling which is perfect for comedy. He regularly puts on his New York Comedy Nights show there. The audiences I experienced where multiethnic, multinational and of higher intellect. Also there were lots of French comedians hanging out and making the scene.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">Comedy is a brotherhood in many ways because not many people know what it is like to face the fire, to get shit on your face if need be, with the quit respect of fighter pilots. Hanging out with comedians is one of my favorite things in life.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">I like what Sebastian Marx is doing in Paris. There is a young hot eager scene there and if you are traveling to Paris and want to do some shows he is the man to know. It's a small room, not a big money maker but worth it in measure of fun and getting your performance orgasm. Sebastian is not only super lovable on stage he is the same sweet guy off the stage too. I had fun running around Paris with him in the communal electric cars of Paris. All over the city there are batches of small electric cars that can be picked up and dropped off using an iPhone app to set it all up. It's cheaper and easier than taking a taxi and being a French citizen he uses that electric car like a master. Enjoying Paris is always best when you experience it with a resident who knows how to get around. Sebastian set up my Paris shows, promoted them and hosted them.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 22px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 18px; font-family: Helvetica;">On my show February 4, 2014 which happened to be my 30th anniversary he baked me a cake and has 30 candles on it that he brought out to me at the end of my show. The entire audience sang to me and it was a golden memory of an evening. I think he is funny, smart and lovable and it is my pleasure to present to you the one and only Sebastian Marx.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Paris.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Sand Van Roy after my show in Paris in June 2012. Speaking with her I was tickled to find out that she was a huge comedy fan and that he all time favorite comedian is Mitch Hedberg. She was thrilled to hear that I was Mitch Hedberg's friend. She was trying a joke that she had written out on me and I told her that I liked it. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this conversation recorded earlier this month in Paris I discover that it was that moment that inspired Sand to begin being a comedian one week after I met her. Because of Mitch Hedberg's influence on her she has a style of comedy that is exclusively one liners. What I consider to be the hardest form of comedy that requires a sharp mind and expert precision. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Sand is from Holland and now lives in Paris earning her living as a model. She is the first ever super model comedian that I am aware of. To focus on her good looks instead of her comedy is to sell her short in appreciating her outer shell instead of her brain power to invent sharply funny thoughts and observations. In this episode she tells me about the current comedy scene in Paris that happens in English and French. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded on February 4, 2014, my 30th anniversary of being a comedian. We recorded this just a few hours before my anniversary show which Sand opened up for me on. Aside from talking about comedy she gives me all the insight and juicy trash that goes on in the modeling world. I think she is smart, funny and destined for greatness in the world of comedy. </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded in Amsterdam.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first met Peter Klashorst ten years ago when he appeared as a guest on my Amsterdam late night talk show. At the time I was told that he was famous for painting naked black women. Having a deep appreciation for dark skinned women I liked the man instantly. His journey as an artist has been epic with a world wide reach. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He lived in Senegal where he was arrested for running a brothel. He said he was only hiring women as models but the authorities wanted to hassle him. From there he moved to Kenya and his feelings about Africa and African people are dear to his heart and he still maintains an art studio there as well as in Amsterdam. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I got to hang out with Peter several times in Amsterdam and he is one of the few humans alive who earns his living solely from painting works of art. Every fiber of his being exudes the thoughts and actions of an artist and it was a joy to see him painting in his studio when I did. As a younger man I always loved Rembrandt and Van Gogh but this is a true living great artist and it is possible that Peter Klashorst is currently the greatest living Dutch artist. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He is now living in Cambodia working on one of the most heart felt acts of his career. For several years he has been painting the portraits of the victims of Pol Pot's genocide against his own people from the photos that were taken of them just before they were executed. Like most great artists Peter doesn't commit himself to anything unless his heart is fully in it and it seems that Cambodia has captured his heart and he will continue to do great work there. He is very open about fucking prostitutes and trouble he has received from living his life passionately as an artist. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was recorded 4 years ago late at night when Peter and I were drinking multiple beers. This is actually one of the first interviews I did for Tom Rhodes Radio. We talked and recorded for 4 hours and this episode was taken from the first 2 hours before the beverages really kicked in.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I respect Peter Klashorst as a man, as an artist, as a true friend and it would be hard to find anyone who is living their dream of being a true artist with a real powerful vision than him. As he says in this conversation "I want to show how beautiful God created this earth and all of it's inhabitants." I believe that the life and art of his will live on forever because it is timeless. It was made from his pure vision of love and beauty. Aside from his superior art and world encompassing philosophy I think he is very funny. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is my pleasure to present to you now, the one and only Mr. Peter Klashorst.</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="color: #000000;">It always tickles me to meet intelligent people who attend my shows and are fans of mine. Last month after my show in Rotterdam I met <span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial;">Zihni Özdil</span> and I was so struck by his intelligence, life's work and personable being that I instantly wanted to record an episode of my podcast with him to squeeze out his knowledge for the enjoyment of my listeners. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="color: #000000;">He is a social historian at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, one of the highest rattiest intellectual universities in all of Europe. He is an expert on the racial history of the Netherlands and the continuing problems that non-Dutch people face here. For those of you who have never been to Holland you will be interested in learning the word "Allochtoon" which means "Dirty foreigner" and is used to describe all non-Dutch people living in this country, even if these people have been born here. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="color: #000000;">Throughout the world the Netherlands is known as a country of tolerance but put under the microscope it is anything but tolerant to some of its darker skinned residents. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;"><span style="color: #000000;">My favorite part of this conversation is when Zihni tells me he wants to be the first Allochtoon prime minister of the Netherlands. It makes me want to gain the right to vote here just so I can cast my vote for him when that day comes. I'm pleased he sat down with me to share his knowledge of the current state of race relations in Holland and what he proposes as the harmonious solution. His answer will surely surprise you. </span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This episode was recorded at the American hotel in Amsterdam.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Greg Shapiro is one of the nicest people you will ever meet in show business. He is originally from Chicago where he got his earliest improv training and he moved to Amsterdam in 1994 where he became one of the founding members of Boom Chicago, the Mecca of improv comedy in Amsterdam that has launched former members to Saturday Night Live and beyond.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Greg just published a book called 'How to be orange' which is all about the ins and outs of Dutch culture from its most lovable traits to the most odd and hilarious. He knows so much about Dutch culture he is actually referred to as the American Nederlander. He should be an expert on Dutch culture because he has lived in Amsterdam for 20 years, married a supremely wonderful and beautiful Dutch woman who he is raising two children with.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Greg produced my recent theater tour of Holland and this was recorded on the last day of that tour. In this conversation we both share knowledge gained from our lives in Amsterdam. From how Amsterdam has changed since the Pulp Fiction view of it in 1994 to the new life of today and how foreigners might have to pretend to be Dutch to buy weed soon.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He was a joy to tour Holland with and I honestly believe that if his car would have broken down that he would have given me a piggy back ride to make sure that I got to the show. It's my pleasure to present to you the one and only, Mr. Greg Shapiro.</p>]]></description>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">It is ass biting cold outside and miserable rain is expected. I am currently on a theater tour performing around Holland and I'm happy to see good friends who live here that I haven't seen in a while.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">One of which is Bob Maclaren. Bob has been living in Amsterdam for 20 years and speaks fluent Dutch. He is from New Zealand and like me he does all the great world wide comedy gigs. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I met Bob when I first moved to Holland. He and I were both considered as the host of a travel program for the Discovery channel and Bob got it which mildly irked me. In today's conversation I find out that Bob was up for the host of the Amsterdam Late Night talk show that I got and he was mildly irked that I got it.

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I have an infinite amount of respect for Bob because he not only is a naturally funny story teller and comedian, he is also one of the top comedy television writers for Dutch television. He now also is producing television shows that he creates the concepts of. He is currently about to finish filming a series for Dutch television that he created where he takes Dutch comedians of ethnic immigrant backgrounds back to their mother countries to see how that influences them as comedians. I think it is a brilliant concept and it should go world wide if the television Gods keep the universal balance right.</p>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Jack Boulware has been one of my best friends in life since I lived in San Francisco in the early 1990s. He has been there for me through thick and thin and through the many ups and downs I have had in my life. Aside from being a true solid friend to me he has also been my intellectual guru who I talk with about comedy, books, movies and life. He is a deep well of knowledge that never fails to fill me up when I need guidance or just a volleying partner to dissect American and world culture with.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">He is a writer by trade and as such he has had a storied career that by any measurement scale equates him to be a true American bad ass. He was the main features writer for the SF Weekly for 8 years, he has written countless travel pieces for the world's most respected magazines, he has written several books and most notably, he is the cofounder of Litquake, San Francisco's most prestigious literary festival.</div>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">While performing in Cincinnati I heard that Drew was now the mayor of Hillsboro, Ohio and when I finished my shows I stopped off to see him on my way to Chicago. He still performs stand up comedy, in fact his career took off once he left Los Angeles and moved back to his native Ohio. He is the kind of friend I cherish the most, the kind with differing opinions who can make you see things another way without it exploding into an argument. He is also what I would consider the most dangerous kind of politician, the kind who is sincere and genuinely cares about the people he represents. His story is fascinating and one that will probably one day be made into a movie. He is a prime example of the great and powerful things that can happen if you follow your heart and do what you believe in. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Having co-created the Daily Show and co-founded Air America it is a solid fact that Lizz Winstead has left a permanent mark on American entertainment and the American consciousness. Like most innovators and socially forward thinkers the roots of her tree began in stand up comedy. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I worked with Lizz several times in the early years of my career as her opening act. I was a very young and inexperienced comedian and I loved and respected her from our initial meeting. She was a strong female headliner in a profession that was mostly male dominated. She shared her comedy wisdom with me back then and I have always appreciated the intelligence she brought to any project she put her name on. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In the early years of Comedy Central I appeared on the first version of the Daily Show that Lizz was one of the producers of. I felt like a proud relative seeing Lizz kicking ass in the television world just as hard as she had as a headliner in the stand up comedy world. It had been many years since I had seen her and both of our lives and careers have taken many twists and turns since then. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Today, Lizz can be seen on countless political talk shows commenting on American politics. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I believe it is no easy task for a comedian to move into political activism and stay funny as well as socially relevant but Lizz has done this supremely. Her current passion is defending the reproductive rights of women from law makers who wish to infringe upon this right. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">In this episode she refers to herself as a vagina warrior, which makes me smile even as I type the words.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I was excited to see my old friend who I respect greatly. I arrived in Brooklyn on the subway and stepped out into a cold down pour of December rain. At her home I was delighted to find she had just had delivered my favorite pizza, prosciutto and fresh arugula. This woman is magic. Right before we started recording she let me smoke at her window which broke and remained half open with the cold air streaming in. I was thrilled to take a ride through her opinions and thoughts on a wide range of topics and I was secretly pleased she was not angered that I had broken her window. She is someone I have always respected and been cheering for from afar. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">She is the one and only comedy crusader that is Lizz Winstead.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">This episode was recorded in New York City.</span></p>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I was in New York last week to film the new Dave Attell series for Comedy Central. At the moment it is called 'Adults Only'. It's an uncensored stand up show that will air sometime next year. I was there the entire week and got to watch every taping. I was on the last episode and thoroughly loved rocking it and can't wait for people to see it.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">It had been several years since I had been in New York and it was great to do sets around town honing my set for the filming. It was also great to see a few friends that I had not seen in many years. One of my favorite things in the world is to get together with comedians I love and admire and talk about comedy experiences and the nuts and bolts of the business.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">One of those people is Jim Gaffigan. I believe the last time Jim and I worked together was in London filming a TV show called 'The World Stands Up'. It had been at least ten years since we had seen each other but it was like we hadn't lost a minute between us when we got together.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Since the last time I saw Jim he has become pretty massive in the comedy world and I think he deserves every drop of his success. He's such a pleasant funny human being and in general a big, bright, ball of sunshine I enjoyed all the many directions this conversation went into.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">There is a slight echo in this episode because it was recorded in Jim's office that has a very high vaulted ceiling but the brain candy and knowledge nuggets that come out in this make it worth it. He's a man that I wish I got to laugh it up with more often, he's the one and only Mr. Jim Gaffigan.</div>]]></description>

<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">It happens periodically that I will work with a young comedian that I love as a person and performer. When Jerry Rocha featured for me at the Atlanta Punchline I was pleased at how hard he rocked the room, warming the audience up rather than fouling up the bath water for the rest of the bathers. On and off stage Jerry is extremely likable. I like his style on stage and that he is not too cool to embrace his silliness. I think that after a few more years of seasoning he'll be a beast on the circuit and on viewing screens that must be dealt with. I love the material he does now and I look forward to seeing what mind bending humorous thoughts he comes up with in the future. He is an undiscovered comedy gem and that is why I am presenting him here with my full endorsement of his skills. </div>]]></description>

She is not only a brilliant stand up comedian but she also keeps inventing these supremely hilarious songs. She decided to stay based in Seattle to be with her family and I think she is better off for it. Her real life experiences are the gems of her material that makes me laugh the hardest but it is her inventiveness in her style and in her songs that make her a comedy legend. She has been a true friend to me and it would be impossible for me to come to Seattle and not see her. Cathy is one of those rare creatures who personally busts me up with laughter. Her innate silliness perfectly compliments her astute intelligence. She is one of my favorite human beings walking the earth today, she is the one and only Cathy Sorbo.</span></p>]]></description>

Drew Michael was my feature act for the week and I loved what he was doing on stage. He's young, good looking, mildly angst ridden and I believe he will be a dangerously good comedian one day. He is from Chicago but about to move to New York. It was such a busy week for both of us the only time we had to record was during our breaks on a 3 show Saturday. The result is some good examination of the shows and the crowds. Smart comedy has always come out of Chicago and Drew is a prime example of this. I believe in his future so much I wanted to introduce him to you on my show now. Enjoy getting to know Drew Michael!</span></p>]]></description>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I first met Des Bishop many years ago in London when we both performed on a show together. He has had a very unique life story and an amazing career trajectory. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Des is originally from New York but has deep family roots in Ireland. He started his stand up comedy career in Dublin and has gone on to have a brilliant television career in Ireland. For the past year he has been living in Beijing because he wants to learn Mandarin Chinese and perform stand up comedy in Chinese.</p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">On the night I arrived after I dropped my luggage at the hotel I took a taxi to the local Chinese comedian open mic night that Des puts on. I couldn't believe it when I saw it but here was my friend standing there performing to a room full of Chinese people getting laughs in Chinese! I was absolutely blown away by this feat. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">In this episode we talk about Des' television highlights in Ireland and how he came to fall in love with China to make a life here. He also explains everything you need to know about modern life in China, the current stand up comedy scene here and the three taboo topics a performer can never mention while performing in China. </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">It should be noted that Des heard I was booked to do shows in Hong Kong and Shanghai and he put up his own money to bring me to Beijing to headline shows he would host. The sold out shows this past week were at a cool book store with a full service bar in the center called 'The Bookworm.' The shows were billed as 'Tom Rhodes in the humor section.' </p>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I would like to give a special thanks to Papa Razzi who created the song 'Tom Rhodes is a globe trotting comedian' that plays at the end of this episode.</p>]]></description>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 24px;">I would like to give a special thanks to Papa Razzi who created the song 'Tom Rhodes is a globe trotting comedian' that plays at the end of this episode.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Touring theaters, giving birth to new hour specials, he even had a recurring role on the critically acclaimed series 'Breaking Bad'. He is a true comedy bad ass.</span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I was a fan of Carl LaBove before I ever even met him. When I was 17 I went to see Sam Kinison in Orlando and Carl LaBove was the opening act. Carl blew me away that night with his ferocious comedy cyclone, Kinison was wasted and I left the Bob Carr auditorium thinking Carl LaBove was a name to remember. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Years later I met Carl when we did the Toronto comedy festival together. On the gala television taping for that festival Carl accidentally ended up being on mushrooms for that performance. I never get tired of hearing Carl tell the story of that night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">Through the years I have become good friends with Carl and I see him as a master Samurai warrior of comedy. He is the perfect example to shatter the notion that comedy is a young man's game. Carl continues to be one of my favorite live performing comedians and night after night he harnesses the same enthusiastic high energy story telling power that first blew me away when I saw him at 17. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 12px;">I'm privileged to have seen him perform countless times through the years and he inspires me because his performances get sharper and his stories and perception never cease to bust me up. He is one of the few comedians who always makes me laugh out loud. This conversation was recorded last month in Chicago as autumn was just taking hold of the trees. We were shooting the shit at the kitchen table of the apartment where Zanies puts their headliners. One of the best human beings in the comedy industry, open your heart for Mr. Carl LaBove.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I first saw Rick Shapiro perform when I lived in New York City 1998 - 1999. He wasn't playing in comedy clubs then he had a regular Wednesday night stint at a bar in Lower Manhattan. A musician friend of mine took me to see him and the musician friend told me "This guy does more than comedy. He does raw naked truth". I was ready to not like it but what happened over the next two hours as I sat watching him in this dark bar was uniquely powerful. It took him about 20 minutes to warm up but once he did there were slabs of brilliance. He spoke so freely and candidly about being a heroin addict and male prostitute I was transfixed. The sheer raw power of his honestly as he portrayed different stories of his personal history made me a fan of his work and the comedy thunderbolts he was throwing down. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I didn't meet Rick until about 7 or 8 years ago at a party of comedians in Los Angeles. I must have ignored everyone for most of the night because my main memory of that party is of talking with Rick all night about comedy in the back yard. Sometimes you need to be patient with Rick, just like that first time I saw him in New York, because once he gets warms up it is truly masterful.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">This conversation was recorded at Rick's Hollywood bungalow. In this chat a beautiful point is made in that comedy wasn't invented for the young and beautiful. It was invented for the damaged people, the ones with great stories to tell. Few people have lived the life that Rick Shapiro has and I admire him because he weaves his stories throughout his brilliant observations on modern living.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">He's not afraid to get angry and yell at the injustice's of the world. I like his vulnerability and his sincerity on and off the stage. I think that sincerity is the bravest choice a comedian could make and Rick is a perfect example of this style.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I respect this man and believe him to be an American comedy legend who will be remembered and studied. Precisely for the very reason how he was first described to me, for his raw naked truth.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">I believe this episode is among the very best that I have yet been a part of because of the time, love and preparation that went into making it.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Sananda Maitreya was once known by a former name that I will not speak because I get the feeling that person no longer exists and that is the way Mr. Maitreya wants it. I love and respect this man so much it is effortless for me to comply with his wishes. Earlier this year I discovered his brand new album entitled 'Return to Zooathalon' and it has been in my heavy rotation in the music that I have been using to pump me up and fuel me up to keep motoring down the highway.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">For me as a music lover there is no better feeling than when you fall in love with an artist's music to discover that they have an entire body of work that you were unaware of. That is what happened with me after I feel in love with 'Return to Zooathalon', I discovered the period of recordings Mr. Maitreya calls Post Millennium  Rock. There are so many smash hits in these recordings! As I got further into his music I went deeper into exploring his website <span style="color: #4787ff;"><a href="http://sanandamaitreya.com/">sanandamaitreya.com</a> <span style="color: #000000;">&</span></span> <a href="http://sananda.org/"><span style="color: #4787ff;">sananda.org</span></a> where I discovered his archive or writings. His writings reminded me of my own comedy notebooks that I have been keeping for years and made me fall deeper in love with the man behind the music.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Mr. Maitreya lives in Milan, Italy with his wife who he loves and inspires him and they have just had their second child. I keep referring to him as Mr. Maitreya because many years ago I was lucky enough to be the opening act for James Brown and Ray Charles. Backstage everyone addressed them as Mr. Brown or Mr. Charles. Even Ray Charles' son Ray Charles Jr. called him Mr. Charles! I believe this is the same respect that Mr. Maitreya commands. In this conversation when Mr. Maitreya refers to an artist that he respects and admires I like that calls them master. I was privileged to have this long conversation with him via Skype and it is filled with wisdom, humor, philosophy and supreme advice from the life of a legendary recording artist. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">For the first 5 minutes of our chat I felt like a nervous fan, for the half hour past that I felt like I had been friends with him my whole life, then beyond that I felt like a disciple of a new religion I wished that he would start. There ain't nothing about this man that I don't like! I'm proud to present to you here the one and only divine presence of music and light that is Master Sananda Maitreya!</p>

That is what happened with me after I feel in love with 'Return to Zooathalon', I discovered the period of recordings Mr. Maitreya calls Post Millennium  Rock. There are so many smash hits in these recordings! As I got further into his music I went deeper into exploring his website <a href="http://sanandamaitreya.com/">sanandamaitreya.com</a> & <a href="http://sananda.org/">sananda.org</a> where I discovered his archive or writings. His writings reminded me of my own comedy notebooks that I have been keeping for years and made me fall deeper in love with the man behind the music.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">Mr. Maitreya lives in Milan, Italy with his wife who he loves and inspires him and they have just had their second child. I keep referring to him as Mr. Maitreya because many years ago I was lucky enough to be the opening act for James Brown and Ray Charles. Backstage everyone addressed them as Mr. Brown or Mr. Charles. Even Ray Charles' son Ray Charles Jr. called him Mr. Charles! I believe this is the same respect that Mr. Maitreya commands. In this conversation when Mr. Maitreya refers to an artist that he respects and admires I like that calls them master. I was privileged to have this long conversation with him via Skype and it is filled with wisdom, humor, philosophy and supreme advice from the life of a legendary recording artist. </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica; min-height: 14px;"></p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica;">For the first 5 minutes of our chat I felt like a nervous fan, for the half hour past that I felt like I had been friends with him my whole life, then beyond that I felt like a disciple of a new religion I wished that he would start. There ain't nothing about this man that I don't like! I'm proud to present to you here the one and only divine presence of music and light that is Master Sananda Maitreya!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">This episode is a heartbreaker. I was shocked and saddened to learn that Dara Faizi died on September 30, 2013 at the tender young age of 25.</span></p>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">I became friends with Dara when he was first starting out as a comedian in Holland.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">He was a young master of comedy even when he just started. He had confidence as a story teller and a command of the stage you don't normally see in a comedian who is just starting out. He told fierce tales about being from Afghanistan and how his father was killed by the Taliban. He was an only child brought to Holland by his Mother when he was only 9 years old.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">On long van rides to do theater shows all over Holland he would pick my brain with questions about being a comedian and performing. There are times as a comedian when you see a young performer and you know that they are destined for great things. That is how I felt about Dara, I knew he was going to be a star from the moment I met him.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">This conversation was recorded on November 1, 2010 in Amsterdam. For years before I started doing my podcast I had been filming comedians for the comedy travel TV show idea that I have about highlighting comedians around the world. Dara Faiza was one of the comedians I wanted to highlight from Holland. Originally I was only going to use a few clips from this conversation for the TV show I wanted to make but since that show is still not in the works and Dara has passed on I see no reason to keep this chat to myself.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">Since we recorded this conversation his career path had been smart, going in the Dutch tradition of cabaret where you craft hour theater performances instead of a night club act. In recent years he was doing lots of Dutch television programs and being highlighted deservedly so in the Dutch media. His story is epic and he lays it all out for me here.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">My heart aches to think of his Mother and how shattered she must be right now. In truth everyone's heart should ache because the world of comedy and performance lost a great talent. I still can't believe that he is no longer of this earth but I am grateful that I recorded this conversation with him when he was only 22.</div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;"></div>
<div style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: medium;">I am proud that he was my friend and I'm pleased to present to you here the bright light that is Dara Faizi!</div>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Verdana;">I've known Jim Breuer since we were both starting out in Florida back at Ron Bennington's Comedy Scene in Clearwater. He has always been bringing head crunching thunder as a comedian since I first saw him. He went on to massive success with Saturday Night Live and co-staring with Dave Chappelle in the quintessential stoner movie of all time 'Half Baked'.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Verdana;">We recorded this conversation in Chicago while we were both performing there. I was looking forward to seeing him and telling him how much I loved his act the last few times I had seen him because he bravely spoke about taking care of Dad and helping him through his illness. It was the most heartbreaking subject matter turned into hilarious comedy. It turned out Jim has just released a film about his father's illness called 'More than me' which is now available on Netflix. In this conversation he opens up about his Dad, the highs and frustrations of being a main player on SNL, the greatest show business advice he ever received from Bill Cosby, hilarious opinions and stories that solidify Jim as one of the most head strong people in comedy.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Verdana;">His podcast model entertainment empire development concept is brilliant and I have always enjoyed seeing what projects he comes out with next. One of my favorite things in life is getting together in the afternoon with a comedian friend and shooting the shit. This is me laughing it up with my old friend Jim Breuer. Feast upon it!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When I started out on the road I worked the southern circuits of the United States. I have performed in every town that ends in ville or boro.   I did a horrendous gig in Mobile, Alabama many years ago and the best thing about it was I made a life long friendship with Faye Woodruff.   Faye is a southern comedy legend known as the Grand Mother From Hell. She started doing the road once her husband Joe had retired and they would travel together. It was inspiring to see an older couple who were still head over heels in love with each other. Sadly, Joe passed away and as she gets older Faye does the road less and less. She has been an important person in my life. My Grand Mother died when I was very young and I have always considered Faye to be a sort of Grand Mother figure to me. She loves dirty jokes and that is why she is called the Grand Mother from Hell because she looks like a sweet little old lady when she takes the stage but then her act that follows is filthy and hilarious. She once robbed a comedy club at gun point in Jacksonville Beach, FL after they refused to pay her. She tells that story here and how she made the most fun out of her time in jail. I also get her to tell me my favorite story of hers which is what she taught a parrot to say in Key West, FL. She loves Nashville, country music and filthy jokes. I go out of my way to swing by Nashville to visit her whenever I have the chance. Things haven't been easy since Joe died but she loves life and believes in laughter and jokes to be the sweetest joys a person could know. Once you hear this conversation, recorded in Nashville last year, you will know why I have loved her since the day I met her and why she is called the Grand Mother from Hell. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">I worked with Stephan Grant earlier this year in Kuala Lumpur. </div>
<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">He has a lightning quick wit and powers out jokes on a wide range of topics. He writes for many television shows and comedy TV stars in the UK. If you see him work it is no surprise he is in such hot demand as a writer. I enjoyed watching him work night after night and he shoots out punchlines like an AK 47 in rapid powerful procession. He lives in Brighton, the artist hipster capitol of England and if you don't know him already you will be glad for the introduction. He made comedy history when he was sued by his ex-wife for making jokes about her. In that regard he has done something for the entire industry by defending the right to joke about whatever you like. The man has my respect and I thank him for the truck loads of laughter he delivers. Enjoy one of England's finest comedians!</div>]]></description>

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px;">Many times as a comedian I will work with a younger comedian who I believe has true talent and a bright future. I had met Carlos Valencia through Doug Stanhope several years ago but didn't get to see him work until he opened for me last year at Comedy On State in Madison. He has a dark twisted sense of humor and he is following the path of a comedian with a pure heart. He is a golden human being and a comedian you should know about so that it is no surprise when he rises up in the near future. Please enjoy my friend, Carlos Valencia.</div>]]></description>

I went there once and never wanted to return because I thought it was soulless. He invited me to perform there again and said if I didn't like it he would pay me double.</div>

<div style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;">When I returned he proceeded to show me a Singapore I never knew existed. Late night clubs, fun parties, beer festivals and the most delicious street food on the planet. Forever he will live on in my heart as the man who turned me on to black pepper crab. A Singapore specialty that is worth buying a plane ticket to go there for.</div>

<div style="font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; color: #444444; line-height: 24px; font-size: 16px;">His story is mind blowing.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Rhodes Radio is in Los Angeles!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jimmy Shubert is a comedian I have loved and respected for years. He has always been a strong performer with hard hitting jokes. I've known him for many years and I enjoy him because not only is he a kind hearted friend, he constantly cracks me up. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a comedian with a lot of years under my belt there are not too many people who just being in their presence cracks me up but Jimmy is one of those few people who do. </p>
<p></p>
<p>On a recent visit to Los Angeles I stopped by his house where we recorded this episode at his kitchen table with freshly brewed cups of coffee. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As a live performing comedian I find him to be a total head cruncher! The man knows how to destroy a room! He owns my respect. He recently had performed in China and Israel and we had a lot of catching up to do since we had last seen each other. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It's always a good day when I get to hang out with Jimmy Shubert! Enjoy!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Rhodes is in New Zealand! </p>
<p>After doing the New Zealand Comedy Festival in Auckland for 2 weeks I did a best of the fest tour with a small group of comedians that went all over the country. This was an epic adventure in the land of epic adventures. We performed in gorgeous theaters nightly, had daily flights or long van rides. It was a fun group to travel with because nobody on this tour was a douche bag. </p>
<p>Of the comedians on the line up Chris Martin from London killed it every night. He is young, handsome and has the right passion for comedy. I was impressed that he carried the same style of notebook that I did, scribbling ideas in it every day and consulting it before he went on stage.</p>
<p>There is an exciting period when you are fresh into comedy and you are looking for jokes in everything. Chris Martin has that enthusiasm and I respect him for it. Everyone on the tour bonded friendships and supported each other. We all laughed truck loads enjoying the hundreds and hundreds of miles we were traveling together. </p>
<p>At the end of the tour Chris Martin and I sat down to have this chat back stage at the Regent theater on Broadway in Palmerston North, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Chris Martin is a joy to watch perform and even more fun to shoot the shit with back stage before a show.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tom Rhodes Radio is in New Zealand! After doing the NZ comedy Festival in Auckland I did a 2 week best of the fest tour going all over the country. With a small group of comedians we shared planes, van rides, and stages every night for 2 weeks. Of this great group of guys Jesse Griffin and I became fast friends. He is lovably smooth and his jokes are sharply funny.  I thought him to be one of the best Kiwi comedians that I saw.</p>
<p>Aside from being a comedian, writing for television and making movies he has an American cowboy persona that he performs under the name of Wilson Dixon. As Wilson Dixon he has toured comedy festivals around the world achieving great success. Wilson Dixon is a philosophical wise cracking American Country & Western singer songwriter with thunderously good punchlines. Jesse Griffin is a man of many talents and he is good fun to be on tour with.</p>
<p>We recorded this at the end of our 2 week tour together in Timaru, New Zealand. Our days were so full of traveling and performing and in a town without much to do we had this chat where we talk about interesting facts about New Zealand, the extraordinary event of meeting his wife, the killer character he created with Wilson Dixon, killing his demons before making babies, the joy of comedy and a wide range of subjects bouncing off of each others ideas.</p>
<p>New Zealand is one of the heavenliest places on earth and one of the best gems I found there is Jesse Griffin.  </p>]]></description>
