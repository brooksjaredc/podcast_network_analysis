      <title>Ben McKenzie</title>
      <description>Lightning has struck three times for Ben McKenzie when it comes to beloved TV shows but the guy could use a break. 22 hours of TV a year isn't for lightweights and nowadays Ben's a father and a husband (to co-star Morena Baccarin) but he still knows how lucky he is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And of course it all started with "The O.C.". On this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Ben talks frankly about the opportunity and frustrations associated with becoming a teen heartthrob virtually out of nowhere. Plus he discusses the critically beloved series, "Southland", and his current project, "Gotham", in which he's just directed his second episode. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>It's a movie musical trifecta on this edition of "Happy Sad Confused"! Hugh Jackman returns to the show and this time he's brought some very talented friends, the Oscar/Grammy/Tony winning team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. All three are basking in the glow of their hugely successful original movie musical, "The Greatest Showman".&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite a soft initial opening and divided critics, the audiences have spoken and they love this film to the tune of nearly $400 million worldwide. In this conversation the trio talk to Josh about the film's unlikely trajectory, what they'd like to do with the material next, and why a superhero musical may not be such a bad idea!</description>

      <description>Come for the effortless charm of Paul Rudd and Justin Theroux but stay for the fart talk. That's right, this episode of "Happy Sad Confused" runs the gamut but what would you expect when Josh is visited by these two hilarious actor/writers?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First there's the important stuff. Paul and Justin have re-teamed for a 4th time on screen with their new film, "Mute", a sci-fi noir from the mind of Duncan Jones. But these two can riff on anything and Josh takes full advantage in this chat. Among the topics broached: that distinctive NPR voice, how challenging the luge really is, that time Paul was in a Hong Kong action movie, their favorite underrated comedies, and yes, flatulence.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>Whether you know it or not, you've probably seen most of Francis Lawrence's films and likely many of his iconic music videos (he's helmed classics for the likes of Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, and Beyonce). Lawrence isn't a bombastic personality but don't let his amiable manner fool you, he's at the top of his craft, working with huge budgets, beloved franchises, and ginormous movie stars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look no further than "Red Sparrow", the spy thriller coming out March 2nd that stars Jennifer Lawrence (this marks Francis' 4th consecutive collaboration with the Oscar winner). In this visit to "Happy Sad Confused", Lawrence talks about his unique creative partnership with Jennifer, how she put herself through the ringer for their latest film, and what it was like to helm the last three installments of "The Hunger Games" saga.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, Lawrence reflects on his regrets surrounding "Constantine" and "I Am Legend", whether there's another comic book film in him, and why he's excited about potentially directing a "Battlestar Galactica" film.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>Let's be honest, a year ago very few people knew who Rachel Brosnahan was. Hell, even a couple months ago, before "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" debuted on Amazon, she could still pass by unnoticed on the streets of New York where she lives. That's all starting to change very rapidly now that her Amazon series has landed and garnered amazing reviews, not to mention a Golden Globe for Best Comedy Series and a Best Actress award for Brosnahan herself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Brosnahan talks about what it's like to be the face and voice of Midge, the memorable center of this delightful series.

      <title>Domhnall Gleeson Vol. II</title>
      <description>It's the 200th episode of "Happy Sad Confused" and what better way to celebrate than to bring back one of our favorite guests, Domhnall Gleeson!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like it's always an embarrassment of riches when Domhnall re-enters the spotlight and that's certainly the case right now with no less than three films out within weeks of each other, "A Futile and Stupid Gesture", "Star Wars: The Last Jedi", and "Peter Rabbit".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh visits with Domhnall who is enjoying his first Sundance film festival with the story of the rise and fall of the National Lampoon, "A Futile and Stupid Gesture", premiering there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But of course this conversation veers all over the place in the best possible way with plenty of fun Star Wars talk and much more.</description>

      <description>There's a lot of laughter and even some tears on this episode of "Happy Sad Confused". Would you expect anything less from two icons like Jane Fonda &amp;amp; Lily Tomlin?

      <title>Garrett Hedlund</title>
      <description>A new year of “Happy Sad Confused” begins with a newcomer to the podcast, Garrett Hedlund!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his latest film, “Mudbound”, Garrett once again proves his taste runs more indie than blockbuster. Plus, he’s got a new Steven Soderbergh show, “Mosaic” to talk about! Garrett talks to Josh about his memorable film debut in “Troy” (and why he wore a pink thong to a meeting with Brad Pitt), the saga of bringing “On the Road” to the big screen, why he’s just fine with opting out of franchise film opportunities like “Captain America” and “Akira”, plus he sings!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also revealed, what sounds like the coolest fantasy football league in existence, a league that counts Garrett, Chris Pratt, Miles Teller, Chris Evans, John Krasinski, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Jeremy Renner, and James Marsden.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Christian Bale</title>
      <description>When your name has become a verb to other actors, you know you're doing something right. ie. If you're "pulling a Christian Bale", then you've probably just gained or lost a tremendous amount of weight all in the interest of transforming for a role. He's done it a few times. Down for "The Machinist". Way back up for Batman. Down again for his Oscar winning role in "The Fighter". And guess what, he's back up again to play none other than Dick Cheney in a upcoming film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That's the Christian Bale who sat with Josh for this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", an actor who relishes going all in. And he goes all in for this conversation, speaking with surprising candor about what it took to play a man who dresses up as a bat, why he regrets his Terminator movie, and how he moved on from that infamous leaked audio meltdown on the set of that same film.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of that plus the tantalizing fact that one franchise Christian could envision himself joining is Star Wars! Christian's new film is "Hostiles" from director Scott Cooper. It's now out in theaters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Michael Stuhlbarg</title>
      <description>If there's one scene from a feature film released in 2017 that should go into a time capsule for future actors showing how it's done, it might as well be Michael Stuhlbarg's monologue that comes near the end of "Call Me By Your Name". To those who know Stuhlbarg's diverse resume it shouldn't be much of a surprise. This is an actor who can do just about anything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He's been "Hamlet" on the stage and led a brilliant Coen brothers film ("A Serious Man") but he's also carved out a career as an unparalleled character actor playing roles big and small for the likes of Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. The only common denominator in his performances seems to be excellence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Stuhlbarg gives a master class on his approach to acting on the stage and screen, how his career changed virtually overnight thanks to the Coen brothers, and what it was like to work on a trio of acclaimed films ("The Shape of Water" and "The Post" round out the group" out this year.</description>

      <description>It's hard to pick a favorite Richard Jenkins performance simply because he's always excellent. Do you love him as the suffering father in "Step-Brothers"? Or maybe for his Oscar nominated performance as a solitary widower who takes up the drums in "The Visitor"? Or perhaps his nearly silent turn as an aging caretaker of a vampire in "Let Me In"? And how could we forget his ATF agent in "Flirting With Disaster"?!? In other words, the man has range like few others in his profession.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this visit to "Happy Sad Confused", Jenkins talks to Josh about his approach to acting, why he had given up on a film career decades ago, how he's managed to carve out a prosperous career while living in Rhode Island, and of course, his latest role in Guillermo Del Toro's magical new film, "The Shape of Water".</description>

      <title>Armie Hammer</title>
      <description>It would be so easy to hate Armie Hammer. He's been blessed with the kind of looks that would make Captain America roll his eyes. He was born into privilege. And he was cast as one of the most iconic superheroes ever (Batman) at 19 years old with virtually zero film experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But damn it, try not to fall in love with Armie Hammer. Go ahead listen to this podcast and try! Good luck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Hammer proves himself to be a charming self effacing storyteller (how many times did he see "Titanic" in the theater?!?) and gets candid on the up and down arc of his career -- from the highs of "The Social Network" to the lows of "The Lone Ranger".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus Armie talks about his beloved new film, "Call Me By Your Name", why he could only have done it now, and why he's cool with becoming a dancing internet meme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of that AND Josh picks Armie's brain about the long lost "Justice League" film he almost starred in, why he doesn't have any desire to play a superhero, and whether he'd ever work with Roman Polanski.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Denis Villeneuve</title>
      <description>It seemed like an impossible proposition for any filmmaker but somehow miraculously Denis Villeneuve achieved the next to impossible -- directing a sequel to "Blade Runner" that actually may rival (and in some critics' estimation surpass) the original.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this SPOILER-filled (you've been warned!) conversation about "Blade Runner 2049" with filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, Josh finds out how why Denis couldn't pass up the opportunity to direct, what scene worried him all the way up to release, and whether a 3rd installment may in fact still come to pass (spoiler: it might!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus Josh talks to Villeneuve about his love of sci-fi, what he's planning for his adaptation for "Dune", and what could lure the director to the Star Wars universe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Ben Mendelsohn</title>
      <description>Ben Mendelsohn admits that only a few years ago he'd all but given up on his dreams of a film career. For a couple decades he'd experienced pockets of success in his home country of Australia but while his contemporaries like Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce broke through it just seemed like it was never going to happen for Mendelsohn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Mendelsohn tells the story in this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", it all changed with a little crime thriller named "Animal Kingdom". Since then it's been a remarkable run for Ben and he tells Josh all about it here, from starring opposite Ryan Reynolds in "Mississippi Grind" to playing an instantly iconic Star Wars villain in "Rogue One".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mendelsohn geeks out with Josh about their mutual love of his "Darkest Hour" co-star, Gary Oldman, plus he talks about the prospect of playing a villain in "Captain Marvel" and reveals why his dream role is Doctor Doom!</description>

      <description>Jon Bernthal knows how lucky he is. "Art has saved my life," he says on this episode of "Happy Sad Confused". In truth, it's a lot more than luck that's gotten Bernthal to where he is today, a much in demand actor on the big and small screen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bernthal has definitely had an atypical journey, from getting his nose broken more times than he can count to studying his craft in Moscow. He talks about it all with Josh including how "The Walking Dead" turned his life around and how the premature departure of executive producer Frank Darabont rattled him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plus, Jon and Josh talk about their mutual love for Shia LaBeouf and why The Punisher is the comic character Bernthal was best suited for.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Josh Hutcherson</title>
      <description>Josh Hutcherson only seems to be the most well adjusted child actor turned young adult performer in Hollywood. In fact, as you'll learn in this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Josh is hiding an abundance of secret traumas, from Tom Hanks mocking his flatulence on the set of "The Polar Express" to having his first kiss be on camera for "Little Manhattan".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully Josh takes it all in stride on this episode of "Happy Sad Confused" which gets a little raunchy thanks to his filthy (and hilarious) new Hulu show, "Future Man". Josh also talks about the moment he thought he'd landed the role of Spider-Man, how he looks back on "The Hunger Games" and why he's sick of Los Angeles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josh also stars in the James Franco comedy, "The Disaster Artist", out in theaters in December!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>There's no rule that says film directors have to be as entertaining as their films but Taika Waititi is just that.

      <title>Tim Roth</title>
      <description>You can tell a lot about an actor by the filmmakers they've worked with. And if that's the case, there is no one more respected than Tim Roth. From Quentin Tarantino to Francis Ford Coppola, from David Lynch to Ava DuVernay, Roth is always in high demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", Roth reflects on impressive credits, his humble beginnings, when he knew Tarantino was something special, whether he's interested in more comic book films or a Star Wars baddie, plus why he turned down playing Snape in the Harry Potter films.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roth is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, "Tin Star".&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Dylan O'Brien</title>
      <description>Dylan O'Brien is at a crossroads in his career and he knows it. On this episode of "Happy Sad Confused", the young actor talks to Josh about the end of one era and perhaps the beginning of another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dylan talks about his beginnings, growing up the son of an actor and a cameraman, his early aspirations to direct, and how he's desperate to get rid of his early youtube videos to this day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there's "Teen Wolf" of course which launched O'Brien. Dylan discusses the early days of the show and why it was important for him to come back for the final season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Things get serious in this conversation as well when Dylan speaks openly about the traumatic accident on the set of "The Maze Runner: The Death Cure" last year that had him questioning everything.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then there's Dylan's new potential action franchise, "American Assassin". Dylan talks about the pressures of being an action star and why the film was ultimately therapeutic.&amp;nbsp;</description>

As a teenager she flirted with a career in journalism, but decided to double down on her passion for acting and things have been paying off in a big way ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since her film debut in “The Blind Side," she’s led fantasy films like “Mirror Mirror” and “The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,” but 2017 will likely be the year she’ll look back on as a game changer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this, her first visit to “Happy Sad Confused,” Collins talks openly about growing up as the daughter of a pop icon (Genesis’ Phil Collins), why she decided to open about intensely private subjects like an eating disorder in her book “Unfiltered,” and what it was like to audition for a “Star Wars” movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also discusses her roles in three new projects, two films on Netflix, “To The Bone,” a candid film about recovery from Marti Noxon, “Okja,” a wild adventure from Bong Joon-ho, and the Amazon series, “The Last Tycoon.”</description>

      <title>Edgar Wright</title>
      <description>Before “Shaun of the Dead” and “Hot Fuzz” and yes, even before “Spaced”, there was “Baby Driver”. At least in Edgar Wright’s brain, that’s how far back this pet project goes and now a mere 22 years later after he first dreamed up a unique blend of action, car chases, and music, his crowd pleasing critical hit, “Baby Driver” is in theaters.&lt;br&gt;With this, in his first visit to “Happy Sad Confused”, Wright and Josh of course engage in full on nerding out on everything from "Mad Max" to "Star Wars." Wright reveals the first filmmaker that gave his films a seal of approval and why he regrets his one chance encounter with Martin Scorsese.&lt;br&gt;Plus, Wright opens up about the awkwardness that came after leaving “Ant-Man”, including why he still can’t even bring himself to watch a trailer for the film.</description>

      <title>Will Arnett</title>
      <description>Despite an arbitrary underlying tension with Josh that’s been festering for years, Will Arnett is the delightful guest on this week’s episode of “Happy Sad Confused.” In truth, Will and Josh get along famously, but what’s life without a designated nemesis, even if it’s all in good fun?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, every self-respecting comedy nerd became obsessed with Arnett when he appeared on ‘Arrested Development,’ but in this conversation he reveals that his comedy career was something of an accident. And now he’s balancing a little drama with his comedy in the second season of his Netflix show, ‘Flaked.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This wide-ranging chat also reveals Arnett’s hatred of duplicity, a possible alternate personality named Lewis, and how Jennifer Aniston almost died while making his new version of ‘The Gong Show.’</description>

      <title>Colin Trevorrow / Sam Richardson</title>
      <description>Normally it would be easy to resent a guy like Colin Trevorrow, a filmmaker who somehow made the leap from a small Sundance debut (“Safety Not Guaranteed”) to being given the keys to a beloved franchise like “Jurassic Park.” But Colin is as aware of his luck and as humble as you could imagine, so unfortunately we’re just going to have to like him and appreciate his talents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colin joins Josh on “Happy Sad Confused” this week to geek out about “Wonder Woman,” his secret past as a child opera singer, and, of course, his new film, “The Book of Henry” (opening this week).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oh, and then there’s “Star Wars.” As he prepares to direct “Episode IX,” Colin talks about his early obsession with the franchise, why he thinks he was destined to direct a “Star Wars” film, and just how he got this job of a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also joining Josh on the show this week is the extremely funny Sam Richardson, best known as the sweetly earnest Richard Splett on “Veep.” Sam talks about how his one-episode guest spot blossomed into a series regular role; how he got his own Comedy Central show, “Detroiters,” off the ground; and why he’s desperate to get into the next “Black Panther” movie.</description>

A lot has changed since Kate last visited, and she and Josh take stock of it all, from a little perspective on “Fantastic Four” to introducing fiancé Jamie Bell to her One Direction obsession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate also talks about her love of animals (including a trip to Liberia to hang with some chimpanzees and her sister, Rooney) and working opposite a canine costar in her new film, “Megan Leavy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the show, Jake Johnson makes his debut to talk about what it’s like to do crazy, death-defying stunts with Tom Cruise (their new film “The Mummy” is out this Friday).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake also talks about his bittersweet feelings on the “New Girl” ending, what it was like to hang out with Prince, and why his biggest box-office success, “Let’s Be Cops,” wasn’t a fun experience.</description>

      <title>Alexandra Daddario &amp; Doug Liman</title>
      <description>You’d be hard-pressed to find two films more dissimilar than “Baywatch” and “The Wall,” currently in theaters, but that’s what “Happy Sad Confused” is all about — and, indeed, this week’s show runs the gamut.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First up is Alexandra Daddario, best known for the “Percy Jackson” films and a career-altering turn in “True Detective,” who now finds herself reinvented in a sexy comic role in “Baywatch.” According to Daddario, it wasn’t all smooth sailing in her career at the outset, as she shocked her parents (two accomplished attorneys) and herself by embracing acting. Come for the “Baywatch” talk, stay for the classy chat about boobs and penises.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Later in the show, Josh welcomes director Doug Liman (his new movie, “The Wall,” is now in theaters), a filmmaker who has consistently thrown out the rule book in a career that’s ranged from “Swingers” and “Go” to “The Bourne Identity” and “Edge of Tomorrow.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Liman is nothing if not frank about his clashes in the business, including the remarkable story of how “The Bourne Identity” went from surefire flop to phenomenon. The director also delivers some exciting details about the “Edge of Tomorrow” sequel and what it’s like to share a house with Tom Cruise (hint: you’d better bring your A game to your household chores).</description>

      <description>It’s an “Alien: Covenant” love fest this week on “Happy Sad Confused” as Josh welcomes three of its stars. Michael Fassbender makes a triumphant third appearance on the podcast and this time he’s brought a friend: the always hysterical Danny McBride! Fassbender and McBride talk competitive eating, explain why Michael hasn’t appeared in a comedy yet, and deliver some scoops on the future of the "X-Men" and "Halloween" franchises. When you think of the "Alien" franchise you have to think of the kick-ass heroines (Sigourney Weaver’s Ripley remains iconic), and Katherine Waterston is up for the challenge, as she tells Josh. Waterston also reminisces about the seedier side of New York, the magic of P.T. Anderson, and why she’s still traumatized by her audition for “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them."</description>

      <description>While “Game of Thrones” fans eagerly anticipate the show’s return for a seventh season this summer, “Happy Sad Confused” has a treat for you: breakout star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. In this visit with Josh, the Danish actor gets real about his life and career, and nothing is off limits. From his alcoholic father to his ill-conceived choice to do coke to get into character for an early role, this chat is refreshingly honest. Oh, and he’s funny too! Coster-Waldau laughs about his near miss almost being cast as John Carter, why the “Game of Thrones” pilot had to be shot twice, and what fans can look forward to next season.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Coster-Waldau is currently starring in the crime drama “Small Crimes” (out on Netflix now).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Neil Gaiman</title>
      <description>Neil Gaiman’s fertile imagination has been entertaining and enthralling readers for decades. Whether you know him from his groundbreaking comic-book writing for “The Sandman,” his acclaimed novels like “Stardust” and “The Graveyard Book,” or his writing for film and TV (“Beowulf,” “Doctor Who,” and “Coraline,” just to name a few), if you like imaginative fiction, you’re likely a fan.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This week on Happy Sad Confused, Gaiman joins Josh to discuss one of his most beloved works, American Gods, and its long-awaited television debut. Launching on Starz at the end of April, the show stars Ricky Whittle, Ian McShane, and Gillian Anderson, to name a few, and has received some of the best reviews of any show in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In this conversation Gaiman discusses the process of bringing “American Gods” to the screen, why he hopes “The Sandman” will also end up on TV, and why he’s sick of grim and gritty superhero films.</description>

      <title>Anne Hathaway And Bella Thorne</title>
      <description>Why was Anne Hathaway, one of the biggest and most celebrated movie stars in the world, considering leaving acting only a couple years ago? The Oscar winner joins Josh this week to talk about her peaks and valleys, how this Jersey girl made it big, and why she’s sick of nice-girl roles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hathaway’s new film is “Colossal”, a delightfully bizarre blend of sci-fi, comedy, and drama, that’s been wowing critics since it debuted at the Toronto Film Festival.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also on this week’s episode of “Happy Sad Confused” is actress and social media superstar Bella Thorne. At just 19, Thorne’s already got an impressive resume in television and film. She joins Josh to talk candidly about being nearly broke at 18, how social media actually pays her bills, and her new TV series, “Famous in Love” (which just debuted on Freeform).&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Bill Nighy</title>
      <description>For most actors, a life of quiet consistent work is practically a dream come true. And that’s the life Bill Nighy led for most of his career, steady work on the stage, on television and film, and even on radio, but never “that part”—the one that would launch him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of that changed in 2003, when, by now in his 50s, he stole “Love Actually” out from under the likes of Hugh Grant and Liam Neeson with a memorable turn as a rock n’ roll legend Billy Mack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since then, he’s added class and wit to a variety of high profile projects (not to mention returning to the stage and television whenever he can). Joining Josh on the podcast this week, Nighy reveals himself to be a self-deprecating delight, soft spoken but hysterical, and quite insightful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this conversation, Nighy talks about his latest role as a hammy actor during WWII in “Their Finest”, why he loves working in sci-fi, and why he’s astonished that after all this time, it’s now that filmmakers are asking him to take off his clothes.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Scarlett Johansson and Colin O’Donoghue</title>
      <description>If it seems like Scarlett Johansson’s been kicking ass on screen non-stop in recent years, you’re right. A slew of appearances as Black Widow, a Luc Besson adventure in “Lucy”, and now the eagerly anticipated “Ghost in the Shell” (out this Friday) might make you forget the 32 year old started out an indie darling with films like “Ghost World” and “Lost in Translation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week she joins Josh on the podcast to reflect on her unusual career trajectory and also confess “mama’s tired”. So while yes, she’s shooting “Avengers: Infinity War”, don’t look for her to sign on for another ass kicking heroine immediately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Johansson talks to Josh about early days growing up in New York, how Woody Allen changed her career, and why she could have been known as Scarlett Schlamberg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the show, Colin O’Donoghue visits “Happy Sad Confused” to chat about his much obsessed over show, “Once Upon a Time,” singing in an upcoming episode, and his new film, “Carrie Pilby”.</description>

      <title>Woody Harrelson And Rebecca Ferguson</title>
      <description>Woody Harrelson has this celebrity thing figured out. Any man who counts Bill Murray and Willie Nelson as friends, calls Maui home, and bounces between Star Wars flicks and the quirky comedies, certainly seems to have cracked the code.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That being said, all Woody wants to do is stop working. In this second visit to “Happy Sad Confused” the self-professed “slacker hippie” admits he’s desperate for a break. Don’t worry too much though, Woody knows great material when he gets it, which certainly applies to “Wilson” (opening Friday) and the forthcoming Han Solo film, a project he believes might be the greatest Star Wars film yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the course of this chat, Josh takes Woody back to his acting beginnings, how he was able to break into films with “White Men Can’t Jump,” why “Natural Born Killers” drove him a little crazy, and why after becoming known as a notorious stoner he gave up smoking nearly a year ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also joining Josh on the podcast this week is Rebecca Ferguson, who exploded onto the big screen in 2015 stealing scenes from no less than Tom Cruise in “Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation”. Now, as she prepares to reprise her role in the next “Mission”, she talks to Josh about fighting aliens in “Life” (opening Friday), why she bought a windmill and a circus wagon, and why she feels like Hermione on this latest press tour.&amp;nbsp;</description>

Kendrick and Blitz first teamed up for the Sundance hit "Rocket Science" a decade ago.

Their new film, Table 19, opens this week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also joining the podcast this week is Stephen Dorff, making a bold left turn in his career with his country-western movie and album "Wheeler" (now available on-demand).

The final season of "Girls", the show that launched her career, is airing right now; her new (and first!) film, "Get Out", is opening in theaters this week; and she’s not doing well with the news that Monopoly is doing away with the thimble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So yeah, not exactly earth-shattering, disturbing developments, but still, Allison is ready to let loose in this episode, from her unlikely obsession with "Pearl Harbor" (and Josh Hartnett), to her fear of ventriloquist dummies, to why she can’t bring herself to watch the "Beauty and the Beast" trailer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of the forthcoming Disney flick, Josh welcomes the Beast himself, Dan Stevens, on this episode as well. Dan reflects on "Downton Abbey," the show that launched his career; the way his Downton character was initially written out of the show; his new critically acclaimed FX show, "Legion"; and why he felt like “a crash test hippo on stilts” making his new movie.</description>

      <title>Dane DeHaan</title>
      <description>If you’ve seen Dane DeHaan’s work, you might think he’s a tortured angst-ridden teenager, prone to moodiness and ripping a bully at school’s teeth out (okay, that just happened in “Chronicle”, the movie that launched his big screen career).&lt;br&gt;The reality is DeHaan is a pretty even keel guy, and yes a fully functional well adjusted adult. He’s 31, happily married (to actress Anna Wood), and expecting his first child this year, all while juggling two major films he’s the lead in.&lt;br&gt;The first of these, “A Cure For Wellness” (opening this week) puts DeHaan through the paces (if you fear the dentist, drowning, or car crashes, you’ve been warned). On this episode of “Happy Sad Confused”, DeHaan reveals he’s been through worse, almost getting his head cracked open on the set of “Chronicle”.&lt;br&gt;But enough about near death experiences, this conversation is filled with fun, from the actor geeking about his forthcoming sci-fi film, “Valerian”, to what his Match.com profile would look like (spoiler: do NOT touch his feet).</description>

      <description>Welcome to podcasting history. This week “Happy Sad Confused” welcomes two April fools babies as Josh’s guests, surely a first in the annals of the medium.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First up is Taran Killam, whose eclectic career has included six memorable seasons on “Saturday Night Live”, a surprising appearance in “12 Years a Slave”, and now a Broadway run in “Hamilton”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Killam lives up to his nerd reputation in this conversation that goes deep into “Star Wars” (including the tongue in cheek audition tape he made for the Han Solo movie), how to properly imitate Christoph Waltz, what it’s like to direct Arnold Schwarzenegger, and a detailed pitch for the superhero movie he desperately wants to star in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later in the show David Oyelowo visits Josh to talk about his starring role in the true life romantic drama, “A United Kingdom” (out this Friday). Oyelowo also talks about his remarkable performance in “Selma”, why Idris Elba has his vote to be the next James Bond, and even sings a little power ballad, just to show off his range.</description>

      <title>Tavi Gevinson, Dave Franco, Logan Lerman, and Zoey Deutch</title>
      <description>One of the exciting byproducts of visiting a film festival like Sundance is getting a sneak peek at the next big thing, whether it be a filmmaker or an actor. Certainly this year was no exception with relative unknowns like Chante Adams (“Roxanne Roxanne”) and Danielle Macdonald (“Patti Cake$”) breaking through in a big way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then there’s the young talent, already established, but still on the rise. That’s what this week’s “Happy Sad Confused” delivers with four conversations with some of the best and the brightest actors working today, each making a splash at Sundance this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tavi Gevinson is only 20 years old, but already boasts an eclectic list of accomplishments, from writer and fashion maven to magazine editor. It’s her acting career however that is the focus of this conversation, from her stage work in “The Crucible” to her Sundance debut, “Person to Person”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Returning to the podcast on this episode is the charming and self-deprecating Dave Franco, whose Sundance flick “The Little Hours” teams him up with Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly, and real-life fiancé Alison Brie. Franco talks about his absurdly awkward sex scenes, being objectified, and still finds time to rib Josh for never having seen “The Room”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another returning guest and Sundance veteran at just 25 is Logan Lerman, starring in the ambitious drama, “Sidney Hall”. Lerman again proves he’s the real deal in this heartbreaking story of a young writer grappling with success, fame, and his own demons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, Josh welcomes a newcomer to “Happy Sad Confused” in Zoey Deutch, making her Sundance debut with two films, “Rebel in the Rye” (she stars as Oona O’Neill opposite Nicholas Hoult’s JD Salinger) and “Before I Fall”, a sort of dramatic “Groundhog Day” by way of YA that’s garnered great reviews in advance of it’s March 3rd opening.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Woody Harrelson, Jack Black, Melanie Lynskey, and Elijah Wood</title>
      <description>"Happy Sad Confused" (in the person of Josh Horowitz) has hit the road this week to take you to the Sundance Film Festival. So don't worry about scoring a ticket or trekking to Utah we've got you covered with three conversations straight from the historic launching pad of indie films.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First up, it's Woody Harrelson, who memorably plays the title character in the Daniel Clowes adaptation, "Wilson". But we couldn't let Woody go without talking a little Star Wars (he was recently cast in the forthcoming Han Solo film). Josh finds out if Woody knows what kessel run is and discovers why the actor stays away from urinals at all costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprisingly Star Wars was also on the mind of Jack Black in this episode (find out how he ranks all the films here). Black made a triumphant return to Park City, starring in the hilarious fact based comedy, "The Polka King".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, we welcome two newcomers to the show but they're veterans of Sundance, Melanie Lynskey and Elijah Wood. Josh chats with the pair about their new black comedy for Netflix, "I Don't Feel at Home in This World Anymore".</description>

      <title>M. Night Shyamalan</title>
      <description>&amp;nbsp;***SPOILER ALERT***If you have not seen “Split,” do NOT read this or listen to the accompanying podcast. You have been warned!&amp;nbsp; ***SPOILER ALERT***&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;M. Night Shyamalan, so celebrated for his early films like “The Sixth Sense” and “Signs” has essentially reinvented himself in recent years, abandoning big budgets, to work on his own terms for psychological thrillers that could at times almost pass as black comedies. “The Visit” scored with critics and audiences alike and now he continues the trend with “Split”, starring James McAvoy as a man with DID (dissociative identity disorder). It’s all totally new territory for Shyamalan. Right? Not quite. If you’ve seen the film, (and if you haven’t this your last chance, get out of here!) you know the big secret at the heart of “Split”. This is the long awaited continuation of “Unbreakable”, complete with a return of Bruce Willis as David Dunn. Fans of “Unbreakable” have clamored for a sequel virtually since the film’s release in 2000. And while the filmmaker has teased a possible return to the universe at some point, no one anticipated it would happen this way. Talking at length in this exclusive conversation with Josh Horowitz specially for a spoiler-centric “Happy Sad Confused” podcast, Shyamalan reveals a lot—from the origins of “Split” in the original “Unbreakable” script to his plans for the 3rd installment of the story, a film that will bring together David Dunn (Willis), The Horde (James McAvoy) and Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), a film the director intends to make next. There’s a ton of juicy details in the conversation below. If you’re an “Unbreakable” fan, prepare yourself!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Fred Armisen</title>
      <description>In his eleven seasons on “Saturday Night Live,” Fred Armisen appeared in over 800 sketches, proving to be the most versatile oddball utility player the storied late night show could hope for. Since leaving the show in 2013, rather than setting his sights on film, as many of his fellow ex-SNL-ers have, Armisen has found a groove on TV. His Peabody winning show, “Portlandia” has just entered it’s 7th season on IFC. That channel is also home to his deliciously specific documentary spoof series, “Documentary Now”. And most nights you can find him leading the band on “Late Night with Seth Meyers”. All of these busy jobs come up on this week’s conversation on “Happy Sad Confused” but you may delight most in the tangents. From Armisen’s lamenting the end of the nerd era to his creepy plans for his own funeral (he plans to have his tombstone read “Buried Alive. 666”), it’s all uniquely Fred.</description>

      <title>Janelle Monae And Damien Chazelle</title>
      <description>In this first “Happy Sad Confused” of the new year, it’s all the more appropriate that Josh welcomes two artists who very much represent the future. First up is Janelle Monae, already a phenomenal music success story, who has made a huge splash as an actor in recent months. Despite never acting on screen before, Monae’s first films roles, in “Moonlight” and “Hidden Figures” prove she’s a talent to be reckoned with, no surprise to anyone familiar with the rest of her career. Monae chats with Josh about her path as an artist, why she’s always been a sci-fi lover, and the influence her friend and mentor, Prince, had on her life. Also joining Josh on the podcast this week is Damien Chazelle, the filmmaker behind “Whiplash” and the critically beloved “La La Land”. If you’ve seen Chazelle’s work you know he’s the real deal and he lays out much of his creative vision and aspirations in this conversation. The 31 year old discusses his love of “crazy movies”, how a Miles Teller/Emma Watson version of his film (which nearly came to be) would have differed, and how a phone call from JJ Abrams changed his career.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Natalie Portman</title>
      <description>Natalie Portman is known for many things but being a great impressionist is not one of them (she’s not shy about admitting this). All of which makes her transformation into Jackie Kennedy in the new film, “Jackie”, that much more impressive. It might be time to stop placing any expectations on the 35 year-old, unless you’re expecting her to land another Oscar nomination for this performance, because that’s basically a done deal. Far from a conventional cradle to grave biopic, “Jackie” captures the grieving first lady at a pivotal juncture, in the days immediately following her husband’s assassination. On this episode of “Happy Sad Confused”, Portman takes us back to the beginning, how her career bizarrely intersected with Britney Spears’, how she avoided being sexualized on screen at a young age, and finally answers the million dollar question: which “Star Wars” film will she show her children first?</description>

It might be time to stop placing any expectations on the 35 year-old, unless you’re expecting her to land another Oscar nomination for this performance, because that’s basically a done deal. Far from a conventional cradle to grave biopic, “Jackie” captures the grieving first lady at a pivotal juncture, in the days immediately following her husband’s assassination. On this episode of “Happy Sad Confused”, Portman takes us back to the beginning, how her career bizarrely intersected with Britney Spears’, how she avoided being sexualized on screen at a young age, and finally answers the million dollar question: which “Star Wars” film will she show her children first?]]>

      <title>Michael Fassbender And Megan Mullally</title>
      <description>If you’re going to list the actors most filmmakers are dying to work with these days, Michael Fassbender’s name had better be at or near the top of the list. All of which makes his decision to lend his talents as an actor and producer to “Assassin’s Creed” all the more intriguing. And yet, despite being an admittedly lapsed gamer, the 39 year old says, on this week’s “Happy Sad Confused” the concept was too intriguing to pass up. But this conversation goes far beyond actor motivations and career calculations. Fassbender goes full showman, singing his own made up song for the upcoming “Alien Covenant” and debuting spot-on imitations from “Dumb &amp;amp; Dumber” and “The Big Lebowski”. Plus, just how close did he come to starring in a “Star Wars” movie? Speaking of what ifs, Megan Mullally joins the podcast this week to talk about some films you might have missed her in, such as her cut role from David Lynch’s “Blue Velvet” and her blink and you’ll miss it film debut in “Risky Business”. But it’s the “Will &amp;amp; Grace” star’s role in “Why Him?” opposite Bryan Cranston and James Franco that has her excited, calling it “the biggest job I’ve ever gotten”. She explains why in this very funny chat.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Emile Hirsch</title>
      <description>Emile Hirsch, acclaimed for performances in films like “Into the Wild”, “Milk”, and “Lone Survivor”, has returned to the big screen for “The Autopsy of Jane Doe”, a thriller that earned raves when it screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and Fantastic Fest earlier this year. In this, his first extensive interview in nearly two years, Hirsch opens up about his formative acting experiences, from “The Girl Next Door” and “Alpha Dog” to “Speed Racer.” He also opens up for the first time about the incident that changed the course of his life in 2015 when, drunk past the point of recall, he was arrested for aggravated assault at a nightclub during the Sundance Film Festival. Hirsch plead guilty to misdemeanor assault, servicing 15 days in jail. In this candid conversation, he candidly discusses for the first time his rehab time, sobriety, and finding clarity as the father of a three year old.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Aaron Taylor-Johnson</title>
      <description>A lot of assumptions have been made about Aaron Taylor-Johnson. He became tabloid fodder simply because of his engagement at the age of 19 to noted filmmaker Sam Taylor-Wood. This wasn’t the career playbook for an actor on the rise thanks to diverse works like “Nowhere Boy” and “Kick-Ass”. In this conversation on “Happy Sad Confused”,&amp;nbsp; his podcast debut, Taylor-Johnson opens up about what it’s been like to be scrutinized and judged simply for falling in love and wanting to be a young father. Currently starring in the critically hailed Tom Ford thriller, “Nocturnal Animals”, the 26 year old reveals he never harbored a wish to play a superhero despite playing two already. Plus he pulls the curtain back on what it’s like to be “media trained” and why his big moment with Bruce Springsteen got ruined.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Shia LaBeouf</title>
      <description>Shia LaBeouf has certainly packed a lot into his relatively short 30 years on this planet. From child star to a franchise leading movie star. From avant garde artist to outspoken asshole. He’s been labeled a lot of things (some unfairly, some he’ll cop to quite willingly) and he’s not afraid to talk about all of it in this very honest conversation with Josh Horowitz on this week’s “Happy Sad Confused”. Professionally this has been a banner year for LaBeouf, earning widespread acclaim for his role in “American Honey” and now returning to his roots, re-teaming with filmmaker Dito Montiel for “Man Down”, a PTSD drama co-starring Kate Mara and Jai Courtney. LaBeouf discusses his changing priorities for his career, how he’s obsessed with chasing truth, why he considers himself a blue collar actor, and whether he could imagine returning to a “Transformers” or “Indiana Jones” movie. The answers, like LaBeouf himself, will likely surprise you.</description>

      <title>Warren Beatty</title>
      <description>A veritable legend visits “Happy Sad Confused” this week.&amp;nbsp; The story of American moviemaking and celebrity in the 20th century would be woefully incomplete without a chapter devoted to Warren Beatty. He’s counted John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan as friends. He was trained by Stella Adler, discovered by Elia Kazan, battled with studio heads, flirted with running for public office, and was perhaps the last person to see Marilyn Monroe alive. Beatty is a delightful set of contradictions. He’s a charming storyteller who hasn’t done interviews in nearly 20 years. He’s a self-admitted control freak who talks endlessly about how much he values collaboration. He’s a quintessential hunky leading man with the soul of a comedian. Beatty is back in the public eye with “Rules Don’t Apply” (out November 23rd), a dramedy set in the waning days of the studio system and just as the sexual revolution was about to transform America.&amp;nbsp; The film stars Beatty as Howard Hughes alongside Lily Collins and Alden Ehrenreich. This chat goes everywhere, from Beatty’s uneasy relationship with celebrity, why he turned down such classics as “The Godfather”, “Kill Bill”, “Boogie Nights” and “Superman”, to his take on the state of politics and the film business today.</description>

      <title>Paul Verhoeven And Naomie Harris</title>
      <description>A legendary filmmaker and an actress on the rise visit Josh Horowitz for this week’s episode of “Happy Sad Confused”. In the 80s and 90s, Paul Verhoeven’s name was synonymous with Hollywood spectacle and at times, controversy. He directed a trio of acclaimed sci-fi films, &lt;em&gt;Robocop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Starship Troopers&lt;/em&gt;. But he also pushed buttons with sex, violence, and at times with sheer high camp with &lt;em&gt;Basic Instinct&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Showgirls&lt;/em&gt;. But for many years Verhoven has been making smaller films in Europe, often barely getting any attention in the states. He’s back in a big way with “Elle” (opening November 11th), a tale of yes, sex and violence, that earned a standing ovation in Cannes and widespread critical praise ever since. The filmmaker joins Josh to talk about his new film, why he refuses to censor himself, and what’s been missing in the many sub-par remakes of his films. Later in the show, Josh is joined by a true chameleon of an actor in Naomie Harris. She’s perhaps best known for her roles in &lt;em&gt;28 Days Later&lt;/em&gt; and two giant franchises, the James Bond series, and the &lt;em&gt;Pirates&lt;/em&gt; films. But it’s her acclaimed performance in the small but powerful film, “Moonlight” that may prove to be the most important of her career. Harris talks about playing a crack addicted mother in the course of just three days on set and why she didn’t want the part at all at first.</description>

      <description>Forgive the pun but it’s a love fest on the “Happy Sad Confused” podcast this week with two stars of &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; (in theaters November 4th), the new Jeff Nichols awards contender, plus a hysterical chat with two of our favorite comedians. If you’re a comedy nerd, you’ll be excited to hear the first conversation with Nick Kroll and John Mulaney, starring in “Oh Hello on Broadway”. As you’d expect from comedic veterans of &lt;em&gt;SNL, Kroll Show, and Documentary Now&lt;/em&gt;, this chat goes everywhere – from Anthony Weiner to why they’re over zombies to why John is more interesting now that he’s sober. Plus they talk of course about their new show in which they play two “deep losers” as they put it. Kroll also stars in &lt;em&gt;Loving &lt;/em&gt;which brings us to our second conversation of the week, with that film’s star Ruth Negga. You may have seen her in “Preacher” or “World War Z” but this may be the performance of her career. &lt;em&gt;Loving&lt;/em&gt; in the true life story of Richard and Mildred Loving, whose marriage resulted in a supreme court case that forever changed the legality of interracial marriage.&amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Kristen Stewart and Luc Besson</title>
      <description>The operative word is “enthusiasm” to sum up this week’s guests on “Happy Sad Confused” with Josh Horowitz. This episode welcomes two filmmakers—one just launching a career as a director, the other a legend returning to sci-fi with his biggest film yet. First up, Josh catches up with Kristen Stewart, fresh off launching three films at the New York Film Festival. Stewart is once again grabbing great reviews thanks to her performances in “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” (out November 11th), “Certain Women” (now in theaters), and “Personal Shopper” (out next Spring). But it’s directing that’s on Kristen’s mind today. With her first short now under her belt, she tells Josh “I fucking found the next level. I’m so excited.” Luc Besson has a big reason to be excited as well. That reason would be “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets”, an epic sci-fi spectacular he’s currently in the edit room with. Luc stops by the podcast studio to give Josh a preview of the Dane DeHaan/Cara Delevingne film and regale Josh with amazing anecdotes from a storied career that’s included classics like “The Professional” and “The Fifth Element.”</description>

        <![CDATA[The operative word is “enthusiasm” to sum up this week’s guests on “Happy Sad Confused” with Josh Horowitz. This episode welcomes two filmmakers—one just launching a career as a director, the other a legend returning to sci-fi with his biggest film yet. First up, Josh catches up with Kristen Stewart, fresh off launching three films at the New York Film Festival. Stewart is once again grabbing great reviews thanks to her performances in “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk” (out November 11th), “Certain Women” (now in theaters), and “Personal Shopper” (out next Spring). But it’s directing that’s on Kristen’s mind today. With her first short now under her belt, she tells Josh “I fucking found the next level. I’m so excited.” Luc Besson has a big reason to be excited as well. That reason would be “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets”, an epic sci-fi spectacular he’s currently in the edit room with.

      <title>War of the Planet of the Apes and Bruce Campbell</title>
      <description>&lt;br&gt;It's a geek's dream come true on this week's "Happy Sad Confused" as Josh Horowitz gets an exclusive update on "War of the Planet of the Apes" and welcomes a veritable icon in Bruce Campbell. First up on the podcast is a spoiler free chat with "Apes" star Andy Serkis, director Matt Reeves, and producer Dylan Clark. Serkis reveals that he considers the saga as his "Apehood", tracking an amazing arc for his character, Caeser. Plus, the trio reveal what kind of villain we can expect from Woody Harrelson and the scale of the war to come next July 14th when the film opens.&lt;br&gt;Then things get groovy when Ash himself, Bruce Campbell visits the podcast studio, as "Ash Vs. Evil Dead" returns for a second bloody and delightfully depraved season on Starz. Campbell is a consummate storyteller and certainly brings it in this chat admitting "the biggest scam of all time is to be an actor", plus why fighting a possessed colon sucks</description>

      <description>Warning: this podcast is full of Samuel L. Jackson awesomeness. Yes, on this week’s episode of “Happy Sad Confused”, Josh Horowitz welcomes the king of the badasses and he does not disappoint. Prepare for a series of truth bombs from the star of “Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children,” from what the best thing about being Samuel L. Jackson is (spoiler: free shit) to what enrages him on a film set. This visit with Sam is one for the time capsule. As if that wasn’t enough, Josh is also joined by Jackson’s “Miss Peregrine” director, Tim Burton. The notorious man in black gushes over Christopher Lee and Winona Ryder, gives us a “Beetlejuice 2” update, and reveals the biggest fans of his films are often pets. &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>Emma Stone, Lily James, Jai Courtney</title>
      <description>Welcome to the debut episode of Happy Sad Confused! Kinda. Okay, not really. Despite being around since, it is true that Happy Sad Confused is new and improved, joining the MTV podcast network at long last. For the uninitiated, here’s the deal: each week Josh Horowitz nerds out with the biggest movie stars and directors—it’s that simple. If you’re late to the party you’ve already missed everyone from Hugh Jackman and Tom Hiddleston to Kristen Stewart and Anna Kendrick swinging by. But don’t worry, they’ll be back. Anna’s come by three times already.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week Josh has returned from the Toronto International Film Festival with three interviews in tow. First up is early Academy Award front-runner Emma Stone, starring in La La Land. Emma reveals her useless Trivial Pursuit skills, why it took her so long to do a musical, and her reluctance to watch Game of Thrones alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next up is Lily James of Cinderella and Downton Abbey Fame, starring in the upcoming thriller The Exception. Lily reveals how she ended up recently singing the Spice Girls in a strip club and why she’s a conflicted cat lady at heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally is a gloriously off the rails catch up with Jai Courtney who opens up about the divided &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Suicide Squad&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reactions, whether he might be coming back for The Flash, and how disturbingly comfortable he is in the nude on screen.</description>
