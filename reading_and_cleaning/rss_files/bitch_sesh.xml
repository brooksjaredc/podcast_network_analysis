			<description>Dream of Dreams guest Bryan Safi returns to the nook, like Eileen returning to Beverly Hills (except HE has his hair figured out). Casey apologizes for sleeping on Drag Race, Danielle sings her childhood sorrows, Bryan dissects Sheree&apos;s forced photo shoot, and they all live in fear of Erika Jayne&apos;s quiet anger.




Plus, special in the field reporting from Nicole Shabtai, where she answers Casey&apos;s age old question from last week, &quot;Who is that small man with Lisa Vanderpump?&quot; and Casey&apos;s husband David makes his first (and slightly drunken) appearance on the podcast with some hot takes on Jax.

			<description>Danielle and Casey are as troubled as Captain Fred watching the NY skinny girls get MES-SY in Mexico. From Ramona and Bethannys naked drunk pool cry to Sonjas private parts on parade it was a glorious episode. The girls also dig into OC, Deko and Mama Joyce 2 (Lydia&apos;s mom). Much like the restaurant, the women refuse to be quiet. (Update: parts of this episode had to be cut due to technical difficulties. We will make up for it next week!)
