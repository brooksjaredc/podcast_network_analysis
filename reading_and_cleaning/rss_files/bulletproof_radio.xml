    <title>Bulletproof Radio</title>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[<p>Bulletproof Executive Radio was born out of a fifteen-year single-minded crusade to upgrade the human being using every available technology. It distills the knowledge of world-class MDs, biochemists, Olympic nutritionists, meditation experts, and more than $1M spent on personal self-experiments. From private brain EEG facilities hidden in a Canadian forest to remote monasteries in Tibet, from Silicon Valley to the Andes, high tech entrepreneur Dave Asprey used hacking techniques and tried everything himself, obsessively focused on discovering: What are the simplest things you can do to be better at everything? Welcome to being Bulletproof, the State of High Performance where you take control and improve your biochemistry, your body, and your mind so they work in unison, helping you execute at levels far beyond what you’d expect, without burning out, getting sick, or just acting like a stressed-out a-hole. It used to take a lifetime to radically rewire the human body and mind this way. Technology has changed the rules. Follow along as Dave Asprey and guests provide you with everything you need to upgrade your mind, body, and life.</p>]]>

      <title>Does Food Really Have a Vibration? Robyn Openshaw - #438</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We know there is more to food energy than just calories. And Robyn Openshaw, author of the new book “Vibe: Unlock the Energetic Frequencies of Limitless Health, Love &amp; Success” and founder of GreenSmoothieGirl.com, asserts that food vibrations actually hold the secrets of the universe. But how? Can the foods we eat or the emotions we feel really change our vibrational frequency? In this intriguing conversation, Dave takes the idea of food vibrations to task – moving the subject out of the “woo-woo” realm and into the science space. The two dig into the power of vibrational frequencies and energies, how we can measure these, and how electromagnetic frequencies (EMFs) are impacting our health. If you want to increase energy in your life, learn best practices for unlocking energetic frequencies, influence everyone in a room, find out what foods vibrate the most, and why any of this matters -- you won’t want to miss this fascinating discussion.</p>]]>

      <title>The New Revolution in Hacking Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD - #431</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Could you be walking around with a traumatic brain injury, or TBI, and not even know it? Could it be causing depression, or changes in your personality that you can’t explain? Dr. Mark Gordon, interventional endocrinology specialist and Medical Director at the Millennium Warrior Angels Foundation TBI Project, says inflammation is the culprit exacerbating these debilitating symptoms. Especially for U.S. service members and veterans who have sustained a TBI while in the line of duty. Andrew Marr, a Special Forces Green Beret who sustained a head trauma in combat, understands first-hand how damaging TBI symptoms can be. But Mark’s hormone-based treatment protocol profoundly changed Andrew’s life, prompting him to start the Warrior Angels Foundation, which provides personalized care to treat the underlying condition for those who have sustained TBIs. In this fascinating discussion with Dave, Mark and Andrew share intimate stories about their experiences with brain injuries, and how they teamed up to make a difference. Plus, Mark shares his candid viewpoint on PTSD, you’ll learn what to do if you get hit in the head, and most importantly, you’ll get some valuable tips on how to manage inflammation in the brain. </p>]]>

NY Times best-selling author Robert Greene spent years researching the most powerful people in history and examining their psychological profiles to write the 48 Laws of Power, a manuscript that gives the average person a set of tools to help navigate through a world filled with people who don't want you to succeed, wish to take advantage of you, and take what is rightfully yours. ]]>

        <![CDATA[Bulletproof Radio welcomes Walter Crinnion, a Naturopathic Doctor with over 30 years of medical experience and an expert in the field of environmental medicine.

He is Professor of Psychiatry at the University of North Carolina, Professor Emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he directed the Brain-Body Center in the Department of Psychiatry, and Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, where he chaired the Department of Human Development and directed the Institute for Child Study.

      <title>Blue Zones: How to live longer and happier lives w/ Dan Burden - #252</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Dan Burden and Samantha Thomas come on Bulletproof Radio today to discuss the Blue Zones project, a project that focuses on enabling cities to develop strong, healthy communities and how they have already upgraded longevity across the country. Dan Burden, the Director of Innovation and Inspiration for Blue Zones, LLC, has focused his entire career on helping the world get back on its feet. Dan created the walking audit; a highly interactive way to help people see their community through a sharper, more people focused lens. This popular annual NPSG walking audit workshop is designed to help participants fine-tune their most engaging public interaction skills. Dan illustrates the benefits of sometimes-simple and oft-difficult changes, and provides a roadmap for people to create neighborhoods, streets and cities that are more healthy and better connected. Samantha helps communities-neighborhoods, towns and cities-become healthier, better connected, more accessible and age-friendly. Over the last four years, Samantha has worked in over 100 cities, facilitating walkability, active-living and safe routes to school workshops and developing community-led action plans for communities. She brings to this effort a diversity of experience in community engagement, the power of neighborhood leadership, and civic co-creation from living and working in South Africa for a year, to two years as AmeriCorps volunteer with Amherst H. Wilder Foundation and the City of Saint Paul Office of the Mayor.]]>

Rick has a Ph.D. in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and also studied under Dr. Stanislav Grof, becoming one of the first practitioners to be certified in Holotropic Breathing. Rick works to progress the research and education behind the benefits of psychedelics and marijuana primarily as prescription medicines, but also for personal growth for otherwise healthy people.
Why you should listen – Rick comes on Bulletproof Radio for an extended episode to discuss the safe use of psychedelics as medicine, floatation tanks and Holotropic Breathing as psychedelic alternatives, the dark side of recreational psychedelic substances, and the therapeutic use of substances such as psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, and cannabis.

Eric has worked for Fuel TV and the WE Network, worked with Michael Moore on the documentary “Capitalism: A Love Story”, and his documentary BURZYNSKI has garnered widespread distribution and numerous international awards. Ralph has written more than 15 books on cancer research, and has received lifetime achievement awards from the American College for the Advancement of Medicine, the Cancer Control Society, The National Foundation for Alternative Medicine, and many other organizations in the cancer education and alternative medicine industries.
 
Why you should listen – 
 
 
Laetrile is a natural compound that research showed stopped the growth and spread of cancer, and the info Ralph has to share is shocking for anyone that has ever had their lives touched by cancer. Ralph and Eric discuss the history of the Laetrile cancer treatment, why it was rejected and renounced, and also touch on other exciting new breakthroughs in cancer therapy that people should be aware of. Enjoy the show!]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Not all habits are created equal, and some can even help you become rich. That’s what Certified Public Accountant and Certified Financial Planner Tom Corley concluded after studying the rich for five years. On this episode of Bulletproof Radio, Tom discusses his bestselling book: Rich Habits and uncovers the most successful daily habits of wealthy individuals. Discover how to optimize your wallet with daily self-improvement, how to change poverty in 30 days, and why the rich don’t gossip. 
 
 
Tomas C. Corley understands the difference between being rich and poor: at age 9 his family went from being multi-millionaires to broke in just one night. For five years, Tom observed and documented the daily activities of 233 wealthy people and 128 people living in poverty.

      <title>#115 Take Your Power Back with Josh del Sol</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Electromagnetic fields (or EMFs) are fundamental to the physical world. They occur naturally in the body, but are also man-made and have the potential to affect your performance negatively. Josh del Sol’s award-winning documentary, Take Back Your Power, addresses the performance-robbing effects of certain EMFs and takes a journey into the 2013 NSA spying scandal to expose what he calls “vast programs to monitor your personal communications using ‘smart’ meters.” Josh comes on Bulletproof Radio to discuss his feature film about EMF and radiation standards in America, smart meters, and a possible connection between autism and EMF levels. Check out the shownotes and watch the film online.
 
 
Josh del Sol is the Director and Producer of Take Back Your Power, his first feature film.  Born and raised near Vancouver BC, Josh is passionate about the growing movement of social awakening.  He has a vision for a more equitable social structure, with decentralized energy production and foundational values which honor the sanctity of life and human rights.  Josh finds inspiration in those of courage who speak truth to power, from a place of non-violence and vision, laying the foundation for necessary solutions.

Many people would say that the human race is entering an era of awakening. Whether that be in mind, body, spirit, or all three there is a good chance that if you’re reading this, you’d agree – or at least you’re interested. Talented physician and documentary filmmaker, Pedram Shojai, is on the show to discuss the concepts behind his two films, Vitality and Origins, and why he’s in the business of waking up zombies. On the show you’ll discover Pedram’s take on what we should be eating, how to make everything you do count the most, and why he’s trying to win the war against healthcare propaganda. Pedram is a great example of how to balance science and mysticism. After all, any good science warrants investigation. Please enjoy!
 
 
Pedram Shojai is former Taoist monk and an accomplished physician of Chinese medicine. He is the founder of Well.org, an author, and most recently a documentary filmmaker. After studying biology at UCLA he had a series of profound mystical experiences that drew him to the Eastern esoteric arts. He received a Master’s in Oriental Medicine from Emperor’s College and then his own OMD from the Pan-American University. Pedram has studied Kung Fu, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, Meditation, and medicine diligently for the past 20 years, and aims to help people wake up from their zombie haze and live their lives fully.

      <title>#100 Coffee Titan Dan Cox on Caffeine, Coffee, and Mycotoxins – Podcast</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After more than two years The Bulletproof Executive Podcast has reached its 100th episode! And who better to have as a guest for this milestone than coffee titan and caffeine-expert, Dan Cox? If there is anyone alive today that can spit coffee talk more articulately or with more authority, we’d like to hear from him or her. Dan’s historical knowledge of coffee-for-consumption is unrivaled and his grasp of coffee culture today is paramount in the industry. In our centennial episode you will discover things abut coffee that I bet you didn’t know, like: the amount of effort it takes to test for mycotoxins in coffee, the current state of coffee brands in America, and what the future of our coffee consumption looks like. This old-school coffee mafia knows his stuff and presents a refreshingly humble take on these little seeds that make such a big impact on our lives. Thanks for listening and cheers to 100 more episodes!
 
 
Dan Cox is the Owner and President of Coffee Enterprises and a connoisseur of all things coffee. He was one of the first American’s to pass the rigorous Q Grader Exams of which there are only 1,000 worldwide. Dan is a leading authority on the Specialty Coffee Industry and brings to bear 32 years of practical experience in management, roasting, cupping, product development, and marketing. He received the prestigious honor of a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Specialty Coffee Association of America, and is also the Founder and President of Grounds for Health, a nonprofit bringing health care to women in coffee producing countries. He is a coffee titan like no other, although he would never agree with the designation.

      <title>#99 Working Smarter Not Harder with Ari Meisel</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Work smarter, not harder! You’ve probably heard this sentiment before in one-way or another. But what does it really mean, and is it actually possible to be more successful by doing less? Ari Meisel is the creator of Less Doing, a strategy to be able to do less and live more. Happy to have Ari back on Bulletproof Radio, he joins the podcast this time to talk about his forthcoming book, Less Doing, More Living and how he beat Crohn’s disease. Listen to the show and discover how to get things done better by creating the manual of you. You’ll also hear how to optimize your haircut. Enjoy!
 
 
In 2006, Ari Meisel was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease an incurable inflammatory disease of the digestive tract. His case was severe, and required over a dozen daily medications and several hospital visits. After reaching a personal low point in hospital, Meisel decided to take control of his own health and fix his then weakened body. With a focus on nutrition, supplementation, and exercise Ari was eventually declared free of all traces of the ‘incurable’ disease, and competed in Ironman France in June of 2011. Through the process of data collection, self-tracking, and analysis, Ari developed Less Doing. This was a way of dealing with the daily stresses of life by optimizing, automating, and outsourcing tasks in life and business. Today Ari focuses on Achievement Architecture, helping individuals be more effective at everything and advising several companies. Today Ari resides in Bridgehampton, NY with his wife Anna, three sons Benjamin, Sebastien, and Lucas, and two dogs Sylvain and Oscar. Follow him on Twitter at @arimeisel.]]>

      <title>#96 The Trivium Method &amp; Transhumanism with Jan Irvin</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[“Most of what people know is BS.” Jan Irvin of Gnostic Media joins Bulletproof Radio to talk The Trivium Method and Transhumanism – amongst other things. To say that Jan constitutes a wealth of information would be a gross understatement. Well known for fact checking and principled verification, Irvin shares his insights on critical thinking, common sense, and psychedelics. Enjoy!
 
 
Jan Irvin is an independent researcher, author, and lecturer. He hosts the popular Gnostic Media podcast, and has done much to expose ongoing CIA programs, such as Operation MKULTRA – the reality of which is only now coming to light – 40 years on. Jan has done over 200 radio interviews (on other programs), has been featured in several documentaries, and has produced many documentaries and videos himself.  He also authored the book The Holy Mushroom: Evidence of Mushrooms in Judeo-Christianity; A critical re-evaluation of the schism between John M. Allegro and R. Gordon Wasson over the theory on the entheogenic origins of Christianity presented in The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross, 2008. ]]>

      <title>#95 Hacking Your PH, LED lighting, &amp; Smart Drugs with Steven Fowkes Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Let there be light! But not just any light, red and blue LED light to be specific. On part 2 of Bulletproof Radio’s Steve Fowkes series, an in-depth conversation from this biohacking master continues. You will hear Steve and Dave talk about the benefits of light for mitochondrial function and how using certain types of light therapy can help you kick more ass. Oh! There is a ton of talk about smart drugs too. Discover new ways to upgrade your mind with racetams from the man who literally wrote the book on nootropics before they were even called that… And don’t forget to listen to part 1!
 
 
Steven Wm. Fowkes is an organic chemist by degree and a scientific generalist by nature.  He is author or co-author of six books, five of which are health related, and has published over 100 issues of two health newsletters.  He has been hacking health for four decades in many novel ways, long before self-care and Quantified Self became popular ideas.  One hack was overcoming severe stage fright, which enables Steve to do public-speaking engagements (see him at last year's Bullet-Proof Conference) and TV appearances (including his15-minutes-of-fame on Larry King Live). Google him! ]]>

      <title>#90 Engineering Resilience with Andy Hnilo</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Looking and feeling your best isn’t just about genetics, you have to work at being optimal. Model, actor, and fellow biohacking geek Andy Hnilo knows exactly what this means. Andy comes on Bulletproof Radio to talk about how he engineered his own resilience after a debilitating car accident using a Bulletproof lifestyle and a whole lot of gratitude. On this episode you will learn Andy’s hacks for having great skin and looking good, why he loves sardines so much, and how he got hit by two cars and was back on the runway in just 3 short months. Three words: deer placenta smoothies! Andy’s a great guy with a ton of passion behind his success.  Enjoy the show!  
 

Andy Hnilo is 32 years old and lives in Los Angeles, CA. As an athlete all of his life, he excelled in baseball and football, earned a baseball scholarship to UC Berkeley and turned down an opportunity to play professional baseball when he landed a role on daytime soap opera, “Days of our Lives.” Andy has since kept very busy with modeling and acting - most recently appearing on HBO’s “Hello Ladies.” Andy has walked the runway for numerous clothing companies such as Calvin Klein, Oakley, Speedo, and has shot over a dozen national commercials for companies like Michelob Ultra, Geico, Nike, Mizuno and most recently Coppertone. After getting hit and run over by two SUV’s, he thought his career was over but through nutrition and relentless hard work, he has found himself in better shape physically and mentally because of it, working more than ever before.]]>

      <title>#84 Hacking Stress with HRV Sense and Ronda Collier</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[“Everything we can do to reduce stress in our lives will lead to great health.” – Ronda Collier
 
Stress is the new health epidemic only that it’s not new at all. Stress has influenced humans since we were running away from sabre-toothed tigers and living in caves. That same flight-or-fight response still powers our nervous system today – and many of us are not very good at managing it. But that is certainly changeable with generative feedback technology like the HRV Sense™ app. Ronda Collier from SweetWater Health, joins Bulletproof Radio for a second time to discuss the science of Heart Rate Variability and how monitoring it efficiently allows for peak performance and a healthier life! Learn about why the average person should care about HRV, how broccoli is used to qualify fractals, and why self-awareness is key to self-preservation. 
 

Ronda Collier, B.S.E.E., M.A. Psychology holds more than 25 years of experience in high technology product development with a proven track record of delivering leading edge consumer electronic products within both privately held startups and Fortune 500 corporations. She has spent the last 3 years as an independent scholar researching non-invasive health monitoring techniques to improve overall personal well being. This research led to the founding of SweetWater Health, L.L.C. in 2010.]]>

      <title>#83 Be Real. Be Whole. Be Innovative. With Stew Friedman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[How often do you ask yourself what actually matters to you? And do you honestly know what matters to the people around you? Considering both of these questions, how do you align the two?  Stew Friedman  has the answers to these questions and more on this episode of Bulletproof Radio. Stew talks about how he addressed these philosophical questions with science and why data can help us learn the answers. Stew also talks about his new book Baby Bust: New Choices for Men and Women and the fascinating statistics he discovered about why fewer young people expect to be parents these days. There is a ton of good stuff to grab at on this show. Enjoy!
Stewart D. Friedman is the Practice Professor of Management at The Wharton School. In 1991, he founded both the Wharton Leadership Program and the Wharton Work/Life Integration Project.  While on academic leave, from 1999 to 2001, he served as the senior executive responsible for leadership development at Ford Motor. There he created the Total Leadership program, which marries the work/life and leadership development fields and is now used around the world.  Working Mother named Friedman one of America’s 25 most influential men to have made things better for working parents.  His widely-cited publications and internationally-recognized expertise led Thinkers50 to select him as one of the “world’s top 50 business thinkers,” and the Families and Work Institute honored him with its Work Life Legacy Award.]]>

      <title>#82 CILTEP Revealed with Abelard Lindsay</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[From chat rooms to forums, the Internet allows us to communicate anonymously about anything under the sun – the extremely useful and the unfortunately useless. The nootropic stack CILTEP is one of those “extremely useful” gems from an Internet forum via Longecity.org. The creator of this underground nootropic stack comes on the show for an exclusive talk about CILTEP and how it works. CILTEP is  a natural stack designed to improve and maintain brain performance, especially memory, focus, and motivation. On this episode you’ll learn about how it was created and why you should supplement with it for optimal performance.

Abelard Lindsay has been doing software development professionally for 20 years. He is currently in his late 30s and in his second year of earning a masters in computer science.  Abelard started investigating alternative medicine and the brain about 10 years ago and was motivated to apply and go back to graduate school in computer science after he began taking the nootropic stack CILTEP because, as he says: “…it was so much easier and enjoyable for me to learn new material… CILTEP made me want to study.”]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Shamanism and science aren’t often thought of as being allies of one another. Should they be? It turns out that ancient shamans were some of our first brain scientists and biohackers! Expect to take note on this episode of Bulletproof Radio with the inspirational shaman, biohacker, and teacher Alberto Villoldo. There is a ton of useful information to be learned from this talk with Alberto including why a broken diet equals a broken brain, what are the right kinds of medicine plants, and how to, “Pass the salt, bitch!” Trust me; you’ll want to listen. It’s a real honor to have such a wise and humble healer on the show. You won’t be disappointed! 

Alberto Villoldo, Ph.D., a psychologist and medical anthropologist, has studied the healing practices of the Amazon and Inka shamans for more than 25 years. While at San Francisco State University, he founded the Biological Self-Regulation Laboratory to study how the mind creates psychosomatic health and disease.

      <title>#74 Learning Should Not Be Easy with Andrea Kuszewski</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Who said that learning should be easy? Not Andrea Kuszewski, a spirited researcher and science writer. On this episode of Bulletproof Radio Andrea even suggests that learning is painful and should perhaps be valued for its ability to make our brains hurt! Kuszewski is impressive and gave an incredibly useful insight into her research as she works to revolutionize education. On this show you’ll learn: why women can make men dumb, about Andrea’s brain hacks, and how to identify a sociopath. Watch out! It’s a good one. Enjoy!

As a self-described nerd, Andrea Kuszewski is also a researcher, therapist, and scientific consultant – to name a few. Her main interests are creativity, intelligence, autism, exceptional ability, x-altruism, and sociopathy, and what motivates people to change their behavior. She is a frequent contributor to Scientific American and the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. Kuszewski lives in the San Francisco, California and in her spare time enjoys obsessing over brains, glittery things, and Triceratops, but not necessarily in that order.]]>

      <title>#70 Defeat Disease Using Diet with Dr. Terry Wahls - Podcast</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis, Dr. Terry Wahls used diet and functional medicine to go from being bound to a wheelchair to being able to ride her bike to work. Dr. Wahls discusses her new book The Wahls Protocol: How I Beat Progressive MS Using Paleo Principles and Functional Medicine and why diet ranks so highly in not just treating illness, but preventing it. You’ll learn about the benefits of neuromuscular stimulation, how to eat using color, and how Terry is using diet to beat MS. Her story makes for one powerful podcast episode!

After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, Dr. Wahls began studying the latest research on autoimmune disease and brain biology. She decided to get her vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids from the food she ate rather than relying on prescription drugs. Dr. Wahls adopted a nutrient-rich Paleo-style diet, gradually refining and integrating it with a regimen of neuromuscular stimulation. First, she walked slowly, then steadily, and then she eventually was able to bike eighteen miles in a single day. In November 2011, Dr. Wahls shared her remarkable recovery in a TEDx talk, Minding My Mitochondria, that immediately went viral. Now, in The Wahls Protocol, she shares the details of the protocol that allowed her to reverse many of her symptoms, get back to her life, and embark on a new mission: to share her findings and results with others suffering from the ravages of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune conditions.]]>

      <title>#69 Clearing Up Cholesterol with Jimmy Moore</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[What if everything you thought you knew about cholesterol was wrong? In this episode of Bulletproof Radio cholesterol expert Jimmy Moore about how we’re being lied to about our cholesterol health. We discuss triglycerides and lab results and reveal a wealth of information on the basics of cholesterol. You’ll learn the difference between LDL and HDL, why you don’t have to be fat to have bad heart health, and why low cholesterol is bad for baby making! And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Enjoy!

In January 2004, Jimmy Moore made a decision to get rid of the weight that was literally killing him. At 32 years of age and 410 pounds, the time had come for a radical change of lifestyle. A year later, he had shed 180 pounds, shrunk his waist by 20 inches, and dropped his shirt size from 5XL to XL. He is regarded as a fan of low carbohydrate diets and eating plans and promotes them through his blog, books, YouTube videos and podcasts. He currently resides in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Moore's latest book Cholesterol Clarity is a joint venture with Dr. Eric C. Westman. This book lays out in plain language what the numbers in a cholesterol test mean, and what can be done about them.]]>

      <title>#65 The Paleo Manifesto with John Durant</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Author of “The Paleo Manifesto” and professional caveman, John Durant, came on Bulletproof Radio to chat about primitive living in an urban jungle. In this fun and down to earth episode you’ll hear John and I talk about Paleo being a biohack and cricket-based protein! Whether you live in a cave now or just plan on retiring in one, there’s something in this show for everyone. 

John Durant is an author and health entrepreneur. He recently released his first book – The Paleo Manifesto: Ancient Wisdom for Lifelong Health – in which he advocates using evolutionary principles to combat the global epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. He studied evolutionary psychology at Harvard before moving to New York City and becoming a “professional caveman”: running barefoot through Central Park, mimicking a hunter-gatherer diet, experimenting with intermittent fasting, and doing polar bear swims in the Atlantic. John has been featured in the New York Times, and interviewed on The Colbert Report and NPR Morning Edition. He keeps a freezer chest full of organ meats in the bedroom of his Manhattan apartment, and he is fully aware of how strange that is.    ]]>

      <title>#64 Grass Fed Beef from the Mountains of Idaho, with Glenn Elzinga from Alderspring Ranch</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alderspring Ranch produces some of the best tasting and highest quality grass fed beef in North America. Glenn Elzinga, expert organic rancher and owner of Alderspring Ranch, shares what goes into creating Bulletproof approved beef and why it’. For over 20 years Glenn and Caryl Elzinga have worked hard and stayed true to the land and the cattle that roam on it. It’s a family ranch with a ton of heart and in this episode you will hear Glenn and I really geek out about beef. You will learn about the roots of Alderspring, why it’s so important not to micro-manage roaming cattle, how eating grass fed beef makes you more Bulletproof, and a lot more! 
    
Alderspring Ranch is a real place, a family ranch. Glenn and Caryl Elzinga have grown grass fed and finished beef in Idaho’s Rocky Mountains for over 20 years. It is in the wild and pristine setting of Idaho’s high Pahsimeroi Valley that they found the ideal place to raise their certified organic Angus beef.  In addition, Glenn’s background in forest ecology and Caryl’s as a PhD in plant ecology specifically equipped them to manage their landscape-level ranch comprised of over 70 square miles of high elevation wildlands- one of the largest certified organic ranches in the U.S They are experts at producing top quality cuts of beef for the discerning public. They are the opposite of a corporate outfit or a front through which to funnel odd cattle. Their passion is to grow the best beef you’ve ever had, and do it in a way that benefits all parts of an agricultural system, including the consumer, the land, the community, the cattle, and family.]]>

      <title>#53 Raw Vegan to Bulletproof Meat Eater - a beneficial transformation, with Kristen 'Raw' Suzanne</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This episode brings to light an ex-vegan advocate’s journey to eating a mostly meat-embraced Bulletproof diet. Kristen ‘Raw’ Suzanne, author, popular blogger, and nutrition researcher, shared her former vegan assumptions, how easy or difficult it was to change, and the ethics of food. We also dove into a detailed conversations about liver meat, fertility issues on a vegan diet, how to stay Bulletproof when traveling with family, and how to nourish your kids the best way possible.
In 2005, Kristen walked away from her corporate career in executive-level operations to focus on her true passion: healthy food. Already a vegan for two years, she turned her attention to the raw vegan cuisine and lifestyle, initially teaching classes and providing personal chef services, but as her online audience grew, she ultimately shifted to full-time blogging, recipe development, and eventually publishing 12 books on raw vegan diets. By 2012, concerns with her and her child's health forced her to reevaluate the nutritional claims made by advocates of raw and vegan diets.
    
After Kristen introduced high quality animal products into her family's diet, she saw dramatic improvements almost immediately. Her family now eats a diet high in grass-fed beef and butter, bison, pastured eggs, and wild-caught seafood, while avoiding grains, gluten, and soy. While her personal transformation and conversion from vegan to omnivore has been controversial in the vegan and raw food community, Kristen has been on hiatus from blogging to spend time researching and fully exploring the nutritional and culinary aspects of eating in this new way for her family.]]>

      <title>#50 New Bulletproof iPhone App, Food Sensitivities &amp; HRV with Ronda Collier from SweetWater Health</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The 50th episode of Bulletproof Executive Radio introduces you to a brand new free iPhone app called Bulletproof(R) Food Sense and to the scientist who made it all happen. 
Today’s interview is with long time biohacker and founder of Sweetwater Health™, Ronda Collier. Ronda is putting her more than 25 years of experience in high tech to work at SweetWater Health™, where they are looking at the signal coming from the human heart, and instead of seeing beats per minute or simple heart rate variability, seeing a huge pool of big data just waiting to be analyzed using Ronda’s crazy advanced math skills. There is a lot more information in your heartbeat than you’d think – stress levels are just the beginning. By applying mobile health monitoring and stress management with medical research techniques, SweetWater Health is creating some very advanced, very easy to use biohacking technologies.
My experience as a bio hacker who used to weigh 300 pounds and really struggled with food cravings, is that every single person has a set of things in their environment or their food that makes them weak. SweetWater Health and Bulletproof Executive just partnered to create the free Bulletproof(R) Food Sense iPhone app to help you find your personal kryptonite by using the phone’s onboard sensors to detect your hidden food sensitivities.  
You can also get an amazingly full-featured version of the app that works with a chest strap to measure and track your heart rate variability all day long and use complex algorithms to quantify your food, stress, and overall health.

After college he dropped down to around 200 lbs and eventually settled at for me was a healthy 235.  As he got older and more settled in his job, his weight climbed and he couldn’t keep his weight in check with exercise alone and he started to have to diet he was up to 300 lbs and was exercising more that ever but the weight didn’t come off.
After he met his wife, exercise was out the window, a carb heavy diet was in, and his weight ballooned up to 365lbs. He was about to give up until he heard Tait Fletcher on Joe Rogan's podcast mentioning Bulletproof ® Coffee and he gave it a shot.

        <![CDATA[For Greg Pomerantz everything is a science experiment. He takes citizen science to a personal level by biohacking his blood pressure and detailing his data. He blogged about his self-experiment research on salt clarifying some concerns he had about salt’s effect on the body. He determined what his salt type is, either one is salt sensitive, or one that isn’t affected much by increases in salt. He discusses how to do that in today’s podcast.]]>

      <title>#42: Alderspring's Glenn Elzinga, Grass-Fed Beef and a Bulletproof Protein</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[With training in forestry and forest ecology, Glenn Elzinga began his forestry career in Maine. In the mid 1980s, he moved to Salmon, Idaho where he worked as District Forester for the Salmon BLM for over a decade.
As his family began to grow, he realized he wanted a better way to raise kids than leaving them for work all day. So began his current career in ranching. After ranching for 17 years, Glenn's cattle herd has grown from 7 head to over 600. He keeps his hand in forestry by working with his wife, Caryl, on consulting projects and by horse-logging occasionally with his two Belgian mares, Pet and Pat. He hopes to train his new draft Suffolk geldings, Red and Snap, to log as well.]]>

      <title>#39: Hormone Alchemy (+ Why Hard Data is HOT)... How to Amplify the Positive Neuro-hormonal Dashboard with Dr. Sara Gottfried MD</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Dr. Sara Gottfried is a Harvard doc, biohacker, and yoga-powered champion of your health, happiness and hormonal equilibrium. She’s also seen 20,000 patients in the past 20 years and applied her training as a MIT bioengineer to how women and men can leverage the upstream and downstream mediators to create natural hormone balance with next gen medicine, and wrote a book about it, called The Hormone Cure: Reclaim Balance, Sleep, Sex Drive, and Vitality Naturally with The Gottfried Protocol (Simon & Schuster, 3/12/13)
She biohacked her own happy hormones and happy brain chemicals as a 30-something stress case battling McMedicine, PMS, and low sex drive. She was offered Prozac and a birth control pill for her misery by her primary care physician, and that was a defining moment that allowed her to step from her darkest hour into the grace of biohacking bliss. The main culprit: CORTISOL. It took her 4 weeks to get her crazy-high cortisol down to the Goldilocks position of not too high and not too low, and she applied that learning and refined her protocol on her next 10,000 patients over the next 10 years. Results were staggering: Dr. Sara could neutralize cortisol, what she calls the “bad-boyfriend” hormone in 1 minute. She reversed insulin resistance in 48 hours. She got estrogen back into it’s rightful place, and thyroid, inside of 2 weeks.
She believes knowledge is power, science is sexy... and, oh yes, actionable needle-moving solutions are hot. Listen in for our dialogue about cutting-edge science, and crazy-lovin’ solutions -- for men and women.]]>

      <title>Podcast #36:Hacking your Biome with uBiome's Jessica Richman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jessica Richman started and sold her first company after high school. Returning to formal education, she attended Stanford University, where she earned degrees in Economics and Science, Technology & Society (emphasis in computer science). Along the way, she worked for Google, McKinsey, Lehman Brothers, the Grameen Bank, and top-tier Silicon Valley venture firms. Currently a doctoral student at Oxford University, her academic interests include social networks, innovation, collective intelligence, and entrepreneurship.
uBiome is the world’s first effort to map the human microbiome with citizen science.
While the sequencing of the human genome has provided invaluable knowledge, it is very difficult to change our own genetic makeup. The microbiome, in contrast, is much more easily changed through simple means such as healthful probiotic cultures and other lifestyle interventions. The microbiome thus may provide some of the most important medical breakthroughs of our era. uBiome will ultimately empower participants to manage their microbiomes to improve their health as well as make important scientific discoveries for humanity.]]>
