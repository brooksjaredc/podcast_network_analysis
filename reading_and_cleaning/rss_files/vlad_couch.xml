He and DJ Vlad speak about how they experience being called Culture Vultures, and the belief that all Americans are cultural appropriators due in part to capitalism. Andrew goes on to explain why LeBron is the best teammate and motivator of all time, how his career is unfairly compared to Michael Jordan's and the Warriors being the greatest losers in NBA History.

The first half of the interview rounds out on a more serious note as the pair discuss racial norms, and why mixed raced individuals are referred to as Black. Schulz schools Vlad on the ways the Transatlantic slave trade impacted not just racism in America but in other parts of the world such as Brazil. He also explains by a person like Oprah who amassed wealth may not experience the same levels or prejudice as an everyday person of color; but suggests that wealth does not take away from the racism of society.</itunes:summary>

 Shaka received 17 to 40 years for shooting and killing someone when he was just 19. Senghor explained that he convinced himself that he would be doing the full 40 years, so he started rebelling to the full extent, which landed him a combined seven years in solitary confinement.

      <itunes:summary>VladTV regular Lord Jamar sits back on the couch to express some more of his poignant opinions on some of today's current hot takes. Firstly, the Brand Nubian rapper speaks on his disdain for female rap records but discloses that he feels Remy Ma created the best female diss record he's ever heard with &quot;SHEther.&quot; He then gets a bit political speaking on how corporations are feeding the masses homosexuality, gives some back history on slavery, and Donald Trump exposing the wounds of racism that still live on in America. 

Lastly, Jamar debates Vlad on Black Thought being a Top Emcee and the nuance of what makes someone a great rapper. This conversation leads into why 2Pac may not have been a technically great rapper, but his ability to emote on record is what made him great according to LJ. The often outspoken OG also tells Vlad why he is indeed a culture vulture.

Michel'le Toussaint was the leading lady of the Ruthless Records empire. Although it was short-lived, the South Central native has stories on end detailing her times with the N.W.A. crew, her relationships with Dr. Dre and Suge Knight, and the voice she didn't realize she had until the second grade.

Michel'le has the singing voice of a goddess, though she speaks entirely different. For the first few years of her life she didn't even talk, but the lonely bus rides she took at 13 resulted in her joyous return trips home after winning multiple talent shows. During our latest Vlad Couch podcast, Michel'le explains the difference between her talking and singing voice and how her exceptionally unique sound sprung a record deal.

During the interview Michel'le also speaks on the N****s With Attitude in great detail, being that she soon began dating Dr. Dre after he tried to get her attention for weeks. Michel'le says they became &quot;very&quot; serious after a short period of time and she &quot;always looked for approval&quot; from him when it came to almost anything since she &quot;didn't talk much.&quot;

Listen on as Ms. Toussaint talks about her abusive relationship with her ex-fiance, how she wound up married to Suge Knight, and the infamous Dee Barnes incident before belting out &quot;Let's Play House&quot; A Capella during this classic episode of The Vlad Couch.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>U.K. artist Akala stopped by the Vlad Couch to discuss a plethora of topics surrounding the history of the impact of slavery throughout the world, Black culture, hip hop's influence across the world, and what it means to be mixed-race in today's society.

Akala starts the conversation discussing the difference between racism in America versus the United Kingdom. Then delves into police brutality and the gun laws in Britain. Then the rapper gives a brief history lesson on Britain's involvement in the slave trade, and how they've maintained a very &quot;white&quot; history. Akala explained there is nowhere in the U.K where there are only Black people. &quot;You know if you go to the south side of the Chicago, or you go to certain parts of the Bronx, I've visited family up there, and literally everyone [was Black.]&quot;

In breaking down the presence of hip-hop in the UK, Akala talks about his Black Shakespeare theory, and how he believes that centuries from now, someone like Nas or Lauryn Hill will be the Shakespeare of their time. He also explains why he feels Damian Marley out-rapped Nas on 'Distant Relatives,' after explaining why as a Black man he chooses not to use the N-word anymore.

      <itunes:summary>It's usually hard to come out of the shadows of your father's legacy especially if your dad is Houston legend J Prince, but for Jas Prince discovering Drake, hooking him up with Lil Wayne, and creating his own music label are enough to cement his own name.

Jas starts off the interview speaking about how never realized how important his dad was until he was a bit older, and discusses what it was like growing up during Rap-A-Lot's prime. &quot;I swept floors at Rap-A-Lot, and I moved to working the mail room, like putting the packages together, and like a street team.&quot; Jas even reveals seeing his father act as a peacemaker in Hip-Hop and watching him defuse animosity between T.I and Lil Flip.

Jas also spoke about discovering Drake on MySpace and the lengths at which he went to make sure that everyone heard his music. Jas was instrumental in getting Drake signed to Young Money Records, and he speaks on the lawsuit he filed to get paid for his work with the Toronto artist. In addition to the legal drama, Jas touched on Drake and Meek Mill's infamous ghostwriting fiasco and denied that the rapper had anyone complete a full song, &quot;Drake is a great artist. He knows how to put words together and write great songs that everyone would like.&quot; He added, &quot;It's not no ghostwriter. Who doesn't be in the studio with their boys or whoever and people throw an idea or say something?&quot;
Jas also talks about his relationship with Christina Milian, and how it tainted his relationship with Lil Wayne once the rap star and songstress began dating.

After wagering a $1,000 (and now winning) bet against DJ Vlad that the Cleveland Cavaliers would go on to be the 2016 NBA Champions, Bibby speaks about the violence in Chicago. He discusses why he believes Chicago has a gun problem, and why he never felt he would be available to escape the city until he became a rapper. 

He divulges into the trouble he'd get into on the streets as a teen, admitting that he'd even had got locked up twice in one day. He then shares his thoughts on Troy Ave's shooting situation and why Bibby believes most rappers get into trouble after accumulating fame in their hometowns.

He's like everybody's idol; he's like a gangster.&quot; He explained, &quot;First of all, he killed somebody and then he rapped about it, and he made all types of diss songs. Man, Chicago just likes negative s***.&quot;

Hopsin starts off the conversation speaking about his $500K battle rap challenge and how he, Dizzy Wright, and Jarren Benton fared against Crooked I's Horseshoe Gang. Unlike Horseshoe's version of the story where they quickly admit to killing Funk Volume, Hop denies that occurrence. He goes on to share a humorous anecdote about how a picture with a fan made Crooked press him, and how he nicely found a way to avoid those problems. While on the topic of lyricism Vlad and Hop go back and forth on whether 2 Chainz is a lyricist, as it pertains to a comment the &quot;No Words&quot; rapper made in 2013 targeting Atlanta rappers and the emergence of trap music. 

Hopsin also goes in depth on his critique of Drake's ghostwriting scandal. Because he believes having someone write you lyrics is &quot;not hip-hop,&quot; Hopsin says he likes the idea of Drake and his music, but he can't respect it. The conversation rounds out as Hopsin talks about his growth and maturity, and how he garner buzz for dissing Kendrick and Kanye. He affirms that he is unapologetic for trolling rappers in the past.

The Brand Nubian rapper started right off questioning the validity of the media reporting that Prince's cause of death was from an opioid overdose. He and DJ Vlad then proceed to discuss what addicts are perceived to look like, Prince's ethnicity, and his flamboyant style.

In speaking about and categorizing masculinity, the conversation takes a turn into why &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; has been cancelled because of Bill's rape allegations. However, shows like &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; and &quot;Glee&quot; are still on-air though their stars have been met with pedophilia and child porn charges, as Lord Jamar believes they solidify the gay agenda. There's also a bit of a history lesson on why men performed all the roles in Shakespearian plays.

Lord Jamar finishes out the conversation by declaring that men should take care of their children's mother if they set them up to never work -- citing 50 Cent and Derek Fisher as examples. He discloses his knowledge of Afrika Bambaataa's accusers and having seen them in the studio some 30 years ago. Lastly, he speaks about the coded language of the word &quot;thugs&quot; and the adverse effects of colorism that may have led Lil Kim and others to bleach their skin.

      <itunes:summary>This time, we're on Bow Wow's couch to discuss the trajectory of his career, his past relationships, his role as a father, and what it was like growing up the industry.

Bow Wow begins the conversation discussing how Snoop and Dr. Dre discovered him during The Chronic Tour show in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. A then 5-year-old, Shad went by the rap name &quot;Kid Gangsta&quot; and his mother allowed him to go on tour with Death Row at the time. This would lead the start of his rap career as Snoop Dogg would rename him Lil Bow Wow, Kurupt would write his rhymes, and 2Pac would be recording in a studio he ran around in. Even with all of this happening around him, Shad reveals he also wanted to be a comedian at heart.

The 29-year-old also delves into his personal and working relationship with JD, and what it was like to be an adolescent surrounded by a barrage of women. Expressing that he's always wanted the women JD had around him, which leads to him reaffirming that he lost his virginity to Esther Baxter, while she may not have known it at the time.

The conversation takes a heavy turn when Bow Wow talks about some of the struggles in his life; such as being at a low point and considering suicide, his baby mama drama, and his break up with former fiancee Erica Mena. It was during one of his dark moments that he rebuilt his bond with JD after a great heart to heart. He also reminisces on what it was like to have four #1 albums, why he signed to Cash Money, his acting career, and his plans to become one of his generation's biggest music moguls.

Bow Wow begins the conversation discussing how Snoop and Dr. Dre discovered him during The Chronic Tour show in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio. A then 5-year-old, Shad went by the rap name &quot;Kid Gangsta&quot; and his mother allowed him to go on tour with Death Row at the time. This would lead the start of his rap career as Snoop Dogg would rename him Lil Bow Wow, Kurupt would write his rhymes, and 2Pac would be recording in a studio he ran around in. Even with all of this happening around him, Shad reveals he also wanted to be a comedian at heart.

The 29-year-old also delves into his personal and working relationship with JD, and what it was like to be an adolescent surrounded by a barrage of women. Expressing that he's always wanted the women JD had around him, which leads to him reaffirming that he lost his virginity to Esther Baxter, while she may not have known it at the time.

The conversation takes a heavy turn when Bow Wow talks about some of the struggles in his life; such as being at a low point and considering suicide, his baby mama drama, and his break up with former fiancee Erica Mena. It was during one of his dark moments that he rebuilt his bond with JD after a great heart to heart. He also reminisces on what it was like to have four #1 albums, why he signed to Cash Money, his acting career, and his plans to become one of his generation's biggest music moguls.

      <itunes:summary>Former Harlem drug dealer, Azie Faison sits on the Vlad Couch to discuss his legacy of selling cocaine in the 1980s, his relationship with Alpo and Rich Porter, the death of Rich, and the accuracy of the life depicted in the Roc-A-Fella films produced classic hood Paid in Full. He also reveals being the founder of the underground hip hop group MobStyle.

Faison admits that he dropped out of school in the ninth grade and began working at a neighborhood dry cleaners, where he initially got into the drug game. After getting a supplier, Azie became a head honcho in his neighborhood. He goes on to explain what it was like moving the type of weight he was during the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; era of American history (making $100K a day). Unfortunately, with the wealth came attempts on Faison's life, like in the late eighties when his trap house was robbed, which left him shot nine times, and others dead. He later discloses how Rich's nephew had been kidnapped and held for ransom.

He goes into depth the moment he realized Alpo had murdered Rich Porter and explained that it happened over 300,000 dollars. He concludes the interview by absolving himself of the &quot;snitch&quot; persona that has been attached to his name. He admits to talking to Alpo in jail and proceeds to deter people who jump into today's drug game labeling it &quot;over&quot; and fruitless since 1990.

      <itunes:summary>Comedian and TV personality Andrew Schulz is back on the Vlad couch this week to discuss an array of topics from cultural appropriation to considering Muhammad Ali to have been a modern day prophet similar to Jesus.
The brilliant idiot starts the conversation giving his opinion on Drake's recent album &quot;VIEWS.&quot; He believes it was a decent effort but feels the album should have been shorter. &quot;There's probably 8 hot songs on 'Views' but it's twenty songs long... Give me that 'Views' a la carte,&quot; he jokingly says in relation to its lack of brevity. While addressing the worldly sounds of the album, DJ Vlad brings up Mr. Vegas' issue with what he felt was Drake culturally appropriate the reggae/dancehall style. To which Schulz says, &quot;When it comes to cultural appropriation, I don't believe that is a thing.&quot; He explains why he believes only broke people argue over the credit for creating what's cool.

Later on Schulz and Vlad debate Michael Jackson and Nas' best albums. The conversation quickly turns from the standards of what make a classic album, to the standards of women that both men would accept in their dating lives. Andrew then delves into why he feels men should be giving half their salaries to the child's mother for a peace of mind, when asked about Derek Fisher paying out $109K monthly to his ex-wife. 

Lastly, Schulz closes out the interview clarifying what he meant when he tweeted &quot;this is a rap thing&quot; when discussing the Troy Ave shooting incident. He states that he meant to say &quot;gangster rap&quot; and how that genre of music came from the streets but now ultimately also directs how street matters are handled.

      <itunes:summary>Comedian Gary Owen sits down on the Vlad Couch to discuss what it means to be a White comedian who does Black comedy and how that came to be. Owen begins discussing growing up in a trailer park in Cincinnati, Ohio. He says his African-American friends in San Diego advised him to go to Black comedy clubs where he started doing &quot;comedy for black people,&quot; which is how he got his start on Comic View.

The funnyman discusses not making it on the &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; DVD cover and why as a White man he isn't bothered by not making on the cover of Essence magazine. He then delves into a hilarious story about Katt Williams and shares theories on what's been leading to Katt's recent problems. When asked who is the funniest living stand up comedy, Owen could not give a direct answer. Gary later admits because he is a stand up comic he doesn't really watch the specials of his contemporaries including Dave Chappelle.

Gary turns the tune to a more serious matter discussing being married to a Black woman (whose dad was involved with the Black Panthers) and having to educate his biracial children on how to interact with the police. He discloses his opinion on White people using the N-word, his racially charged Buzzfeed article, and promotes his latest movie &quot;Meet the Blacks&quot; starring Mike Epps, Mike Tyson and a host of other hilarious people.</itunes:summary>
