      <title>142. Meg Wolitzer (writer) – Messages From Another Planet</title>
      <description>Ambition and loyalty. What we want versus what we already have and should be grateful for. When there’s conflict here, in some ways it's a tension between loyalty to others and loyalty to ourselves…or maybe loyalty to who we are now versus another possible future self. Have I overcomplicated my life out of impatience and ingratitude? Have I broken something precious beyond repair? Or on the other hand, am I missing out on the life I’m supposed to have? Sometimes I think a lot of the trouble comes from the misunderstanding that these have to be opposing forces at all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These kinds of questions and choices are at the heart of &lt;a href="http://www.megwolitzer.com/"&gt;Meg Wolitzer&lt;/a&gt;’s novels, of which there are many. She’s the author of THE INTERESTINGS and her latest, &lt;a href="http://www.megwolitzer.com/books/the-female-persuasion-hc"&gt;THE FEMALE PERSUASION&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/tali-sharot-facts-dont-win-fights-heres-how-to-cut-through-confirmation-bias"&gt;Tali Sharot on confirmation bias and why facts don’t win fights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/michelle-thaller-how-success-and-failure-co-exist-in-every-single-one-of-us"&gt;Michelle Thaler on how success and failure coexist in everyone&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>141. Tara Westover (writer, historian) – Nothing Final Can Be Known</title>
      <description>What does your education mean to you? What would you be willing to sacrifice for it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For me and my sister, growing up, it was a given that you’d get “well-educated.” You’d get good grades, go to a good college, and most likely graduate, medical, law, or business school.&amp;nbsp; School was just what you did…ritualized and rote the way religion is in other families. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For my guest today, &lt;a href="https://tarawestover.com/"&gt;Tara Westover&lt;/a&gt;, the framework was completely different. In her mountain home in Idaho, school was seen as a threat. It was a government tool for brainwashing people out of faith in God’s teachings and into worldly decadence. She went on to become very well-educated by anybody’s standards–—studying history at Cambridge University in England and at Harvard. But it came at very high price. Her first book, &lt;a href="https://tarawestover.com/book/"&gt;EDUCATED&lt;/a&gt;, is a powerful and beautifully written memoir about family, loyalty to oneself, and the difficult, even impossible choices we sometimes have to make. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/chris-hadfield-how-space-travel-expands-your-mind"&gt;Chris Hadfield on an astronaut’s global perspective&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>139. Neil Gaiman (writer) – And Then it Gets Darker</title>
      <description>Adult life, with all its schedules and responsibilities, can turn into a kind of library of locked boxes. The ones we open every day sit on a shelf at eye level, their keys clipped to a carabiner at our waist: Set the alarm. Pack a gym bag. Pick up milk for the kids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But on the lower shelves and in the dusty back rooms there’s an ominous jumble of odd-shaped containers. They hold the stories that don’t fit so neatly into the skin we’ve decided to live in. Maybe we’ve misplaced the keys, or maybe we’ve deliberately lost them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today keeps all the keys close at hand. In his stories and graphic novels worlds collide and, as the fairy Ariel puts it in Shakespeare’s Tempest, they “suffer a sea change, into something rich and strange”. The walls of reality are permeable, and dangerous magic is always seeping through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/"&gt;Neil Gaiman&lt;/a&gt; is the author of the Sandman graphic novels, The Graveyard Book, Coraline, American Gods, and many other wonderful things. His latest is a marvelous retelling of &lt;a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/works/Books/Norse+Mythology/"&gt;Norse Mythology&lt;/a&gt;, with most of the nasty bits left in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/barbara-oakley-why-slow-learners-are-usually-deep-thinkers"&gt;Barbara Oakley on learning speeds and styles&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>138. Steven Pinker (Cognitive Scientist) – The Defeat of Defeatism</title>
      <description>I admit it. I confess. I’ve got a touch of what my guest today calls “progressophobia”. Ever since Charles Dickens got hold of me back in middle school, and William Blake after that, I’ve been a little suspicious of the Great Onward March of science and technology. Gene therapy, healthier crops, safer, more efficient forms of nuclear energy? Very nice, very nice. But what about eugenics, climate change, and Fukushima?&amp;nbsp; For every problem human ingenuity solves, doesn’t human nature create a new one, on a bigger scale? Dammit, Spock, can your cold, calculating reason fathom the mysteries of the human heart? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But you know what? After devouring all 453 pages and 75 graphs of psychologist &lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/"&gt;Steven Pinker&lt;/a&gt;’s new book &lt;a href="https://stevenpinker.com/publications/enlightenment-now-case-reason-science-humanism-and-progress"&gt;ENLIGHTENMENT NOW&lt;/a&gt;, I admit defeat. The defeat of defeatism. This man has done the math. Since the 18th century things have been getting better in pretty much every dimension of human well-being. Health, safety, education, happiness, you name it… And we’ve done it with the most reliable tools we have: reason, science, and Enlightenment humanism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/vivek-wadhwa-what-will-your-life-be-like-in-2027-big-thinks-long-take"&gt;Vivek Wadhwa on "your life in 2027"&lt;/a&gt; (note: we watched from 25:42 to 27:40)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>137. Amy Chua (author, attorney) – U.S. &amp; Them </title>
      <description>I don’t know about you, but for me, middle school was horrible. I arrived at an all-male school in a still very homophobic era as a small, nervous, Michael Jackson fanatic. Don’t worry - I’m going somewhere with this. For three years, life was hell. Then I found my tribe—the drama nerds. Maybe we couldn’t beat you up, but you had to respect the artistry. In high school, Tribalism was power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today is Yale Law professor &lt;a href="https://www.amychua.com/"&gt;Amy Chua&lt;/a&gt;, who shook the Internet up a few years back with her book BATTLE HYMN OF THE TIGER MOTHER. What upset some progressive American parents most, it seems, was the suggestion that they were members of a parenting tribe. A cultural bubble with its own fallible set of assumptions.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her powerful new book &lt;a href="https://www.amychua.com/political-tribes"&gt;POLITICAL TRIBES: GROUP INSTINCT AND THE FATE OF NATIONS&lt;/a&gt;, Amy points out that long past high school, group instinct is much stronger than Americans generally like to admit.

And that this cognitive blind spot has led to our repeatedly shooting ourselves in the foot, at home and abroad.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode</strong>: <br><br><a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/michael-norton-understanding-the-complex-relationship-between-money-and-happiness">Michael Norton on the link between money and happiness</a>, <a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/derek-thompson-are-you-cool-or-are-you-crazy-how-sociologists-define-healthy-rebellion">Derek Thompson on “coolness”<br></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]>

      <title>136. Michio Kaku (physicist) – Timid Monkeys on Mars</title>
      <description>Back in the old days, if your species was faced with an existential threat, you were stuck hoping for some advantageous mutation. Maybe an extra fin or a slightly more sophisticated eyeball. Outwitting fate was pretty much out of the question.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And as much as we might prefer to just go binge-watch something and forget about it, there are several plausible scenarios whereby humanity could face extinction in the too-close-for-comfort future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happily, thanks to our very large brains and thinkers like my guest today, theoretical physicist &lt;a href="http://mkaku.org/"&gt;Dr. Michio Kaku&lt;/a&gt;, we have options.

      <title>134. Jacob Sager Weinstein (children's author) – Imaginary Histories, Possible Futures</title>
      <description>Once upon a time, there was a rabbit. No...Not a rabbit. Lewis Carroll already did that… How about an Amazonian river dolphin. Ok. once upon a time there was an Amazonian river dolphin who wondered about his cousins in the wide, open ocean, free from mud and muck and strangling roots. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hey - It’s not much, but it’s a start. Think back to any story you really loved as a child. Chances are, it starts with a tiny thread like this one. After that, it's up to the courage, imagination, and perseverance of the storyteller to write it, rewrite it, and get it out into the world, with all the perspiration that entails. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today, &lt;a href="https://www.jacobsagerweinstein.com/"&gt;Jacob Sager Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;, has pulled this trick off brilliantly. He's the author of a smart, funny, utterly charming adventure trilogy for kids, the first book of which is called &lt;a href="https://www.jacobsagerweinstein.com/books/hyacinth/"&gt;HYACINTH AND THE SECRETS BENEATH&lt;/a&gt;. It weaves together a semi-mythical history of London with details like a giant boar who communicates by handing out elegantly printed cards appropriate to any occasion, including if the Queen of England happens to spill peanut butter on your pet electric eel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/andre-c-willis-deep-hope-how-capitalism-hijacked-our-emotions-to-sell-stuff"&gt;Andre C.

      <title>133. Jeremy Bailenson (VR expert) – Through the Looking Glass</title>
      <description>How do you know that you’re really where you are right now? I mean, where are you getting this sense of place from? A bunch of data from at least some of your five senses enters your brain where it’s cross-referenced with categories from memory. You’re making a probabilistic calculation: This sure looks, feels, and smells like my office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/instructor/bailenso"&gt;Jeremy Bailenson&lt;/a&gt;, my guest today, has been experimenting with cutting edge virtual reality for over a decade now. His Virtual Human Interaction Lab studies the ways VR’s unique sense of presence—of putting you into a different place (and maybe time) from the one you’re in can be used for education, healing, and—yes—generally making the world a better place.

      <title>132. Karl Ove Knausgaard (writer) – The Way I Should Be in the World</title>
      <description>Wherever you are right now, take a look around you. Let your eyes rest on the first thing that catches your attention. For me, while writing this, it’s a bowl in Big Think’s offices. Highly polished, assembled, it seems, from curved, stained strips of wood. If I kept going, I might get to a particular wooden coffee table of my childhood. Its reassuring warmth and sturdiness. How I turned it into a fort and camped out under there, watching Saturday Night Live. All the abuse it took over the years from me and my sister, without complaint. And how unaware and ungrateful we were for its patient suffering. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today, Norwegian author &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ove_Knausg%C3%A5rd"&gt;Karl Ove Knausgaard&lt;/a&gt;, has taken this kind of unflinching observation, association, and&amp;nbsp; insight to a level few of us can imagine doing, writing a six-volume series about his life and world called MY STRUGGLE. He followed this 2500 page, addictively readable masterpiece with a seasonal series of vignettes. The newest book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Winter-Karl-Ove-Knausgaard/dp/0399563334/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516732483&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=winter+knausgaard"&gt;WINTER&lt;/a&gt;, has short meditations on everything from toothbrushes to Owls to alcoholism, and it’s one of the wisest, saddest, and most beautiful things I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/the-beholders-response"&gt;Eric Kandel on “The Beholder’s Response”&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/steven-kotler-on-mind-uploading-and-immortality"&gt;Steven Kotler on Mind Uploading&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>131. Daniel Alarcón (writer) – There's No Such Thing as Glamor, Really </title>
      <description>A listener commented the other day on Twitter that on two completely different recent episodes of this show – one about technology and the other one about jellyfish, the same idea came up: that stories play a powerful role in shaping our real lives. This idea comes up so often, in so many different forms and contexts, that I’ve begun to think of it as maybe the crucial truth for understanding why people do the things we do. The stories we wrap around ourselves, our neighbors. our children. The invisible stories we struggle against. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobody I know of understands this better, nor writes more cleanly and poetically about these struggles than my guest today &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Alarc%C3%B3n"&gt;Daniel Alarcón&lt;/a&gt;. He’s the co-founder of &lt;a href="http://radioambulante.org/en/"&gt;Radio Ambulante&lt;/a&gt;, a Spanish-language podcast now on NPR, and he’s the celebrated author of novels and short stories including his newly published collection &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Always-Above-People-Stories/dp/1594631727/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516129545&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=the+king+is+always+above+the+people+by+daniel+alarc%C3%B3n"&gt;The King is Always Above the People&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/a-history-of-violence-2"&gt;André Dubus III on violence&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/ariel-levy-the-best-way-to-survive-grief-lean-into-the-pain"&gt;Ariel Levy on surviving grief&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

The invisible stories we struggle against. <br><br>Nobody I know of understands this better, nor writes more cleanly and poetically about these struggles than my guest today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Alarc%C3%B3n">Daniel Alarcón</a>.

      <title>130. Mark Epstein, MD (Buddhist psychiatrist) – I, Me, Mine</title>
      <description>&lt;em&gt;All through the day… I, me mine, I me mine, I me mine…&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That George Harrison song on the Beatles’ last album pretty much sums it up. They recorded it in 1970, and 47 years later, our egos seem to be running just as rampant as ever. While the unchecked ego might be popular at parties, it can get us into all kinds of trouble. This is not breaking news. Over 2000 years ago an Indian prince sat under a tree and thought about the problem of self. His insights and solutions became what we now call Buddhism. And a century ago in Vienna, Sigmund Freud came at the same issue from a somewhat different angle, giving us psychotherapy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our guest today, Mark Epstein, MD, is a psychotherapist and author who combines both approaches to help his patients and readers live with their demanding egos.

      <title>129. Fatih Akin (film director) – This Blood-Drenched Earth</title>
      <description>All of us—you, me, everybody—we’re living our lives subject to often invisible forces beyond our control. Culture, politics, economics, history, even the weather. They all have the power to shape our lives or tear them suddenly to pieces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0015359/"&gt;Fatih Akin&lt;/a&gt;, has first-hand experience of strong cultural cross-winds. Ethnically Turkish and raised in Germany, he has made many films dealing with sudden dislocation and how people respond to it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Akin won Best Screenplay at Cannes for THE EDGE OF HEAVEN, and he’s also justly celebrated for the intense drama HEAD-ON and for CROSSING THE BRIDGE – a documentary about the Istanbul music scene. His latest, &lt;a href="https://www.bombero-int.com/"&gt;IN THE FADE&lt;/a&gt; will be released in the US on December 27th, 2017. it was nominated for a Palme D’Or and its star, Diane Kruger, won Best Actress at Cannes for her gripping performance in it. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>124. Juli Berwald (writer) – Our Jellyfish Overlords</title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;: What happens&amp;nbsp; in your brain when I say the word “Jellyfish”? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re not a marine biologist, and if going to the beach almost anywhere in the world is a part of your life, the word probably makes you wince. Maybe you remember getting stung. Maybe you remember someone putting meat tenderizer on it (is it good for anything else?) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as my guest today, &lt;a href="http://www.juliberwald.com/"&gt;Juli Berwald&lt;/a&gt;, knows, Jellyfish are neither a fish, nor the cartoon villains we make them out to be. They’re a fascinating, complex, diverse lifeform whose tentacles are tangled up in all of our lives in ways we’re only dimly aware of. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juli Berwald is a science writer with a PHD in Ocean Science. Her new book is &lt;a href="http://www.juliberwald.com/spineless/"&gt;Spineless: The Science of Jellyfish and the Art of Growing a Backbone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/joscha-bach-do-humans-have-free-will-or-are-we-programmed-by-society"&gt;Joscha Bach on free will&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/richard-dawkins-is-animal-cruelty-the-new-slavery"&gt;Richard Dawkins on animal cruelty&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>123. (Henry) Rollins, Redux: Monogamy+Genius+Violence</title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;: Let’s cast our minds back to June 2015, before Donald Trump as president seemed even a remote possibility. We had just launched Think Again, and for our second episode (and not much more than my second interview) ever I was talking with the musician and spoken word artist &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjb8sqinKPXAhXQ26QKHVLcBakQFggmMAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fhenryrollins.com%2F&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2AdOQB598oHHT0D0OZ-j2y"&gt;Henry Rollins&lt;/a&gt;, who I’d admired since high school. This was over the phone, New York to LA, on a Friday or Saturday night, and it was EPIC. Henry is a man of many thoughts and words, and noob interviewer that I was I could barely get a word in edgewise, which was just fine. He had plenty to say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So lengthy was this episode in fact that we originally split it into two. Today, for your listening pleasure, with our old theme song intact, along with our old way of having the producers introduce the surprise clips they picked for us to discuss, I give you Henry Rollins Redux – two classic episodes of Think Again, reunited at last. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8SOQEitsJI"&gt;Dan Savage on monogamy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym6whrAw8wU"&gt;James Gleick on genius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX4y9c_DaBU"&gt;Paul Ekman on police violence &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

You’re a Homo sapiens, hanging out in a really cozy clearing protected from behind by a cliff wall. It’s a great spot. Temperate, isolated, pretty safe. Lots of good fruits and tubers nearby. Should you just hang out here forever? Well…you could…but something’s nagging at that medial frontal cortex of yours. There’s a hill in the distance. What’s beyond it? Something different, maybe! Something new and shiny! Maybe today you’ll just take a quick look.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My guest today is neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://www.eagleman.com/"&gt;David Eagleman&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;: I want to tell you a story. It’s November 5, 2016, a few days before Election Day. I’m staring at Facebook, promising myself I’m going to delete the app once and for all from my phone, today. Enough of the political echo chamber. Enough of the ranting. Then I’m sucked into a video, because that’s what happens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s CNN’s &lt;a href="http://www.vanjones.net/"&gt;Van Jones&lt;/a&gt; sitting in the living room of a family in Pennsylvania. Unlike me and most every other liberal coastal elite I know, he’s talking to people who support Donald Trump for President. Listening. Trying to understand. And pulling no punches in expressing his own anger and anxiety over where our country might be headed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the year leading up to this moment, I had seen nothing like it. And it gave me hope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m so happy to welcome CNN Contributor and former Obama Administration adviser Van Jones to Think Again.

      <title>119. Aaron Mahnke (of 'Lore') – The Hunger for Mystery</title>
      <description>For thousands of years, all over the world, tales of monsters and the undead have populated the "whitespace" beyond the borders of our understanding. As the enormous popularity of the podcast 'Lore" demonstrates, we're still hungry for those stories today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Today's guest &lt;a href="http://www.lorepodcast.com/about"&gt;Aaron Mahnke&lt;/a&gt; and host &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt; talk about the hunger for mystery, a human need almost as powerful as our thirst for knowledge. We also get into the meaning of work in people's lives, and how Aaron started the podcast as a "last ditch effort" at turning his passions into a sustainable career.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation-starter clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/andrew-taggart-can-universal-basic-income-end-our-cultural-obsession-with-work"&gt;Andrew Taggart on the cultural obsession with work&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/stephen-greenblatt-why-adam-and-eve-is-a-powerful-story-full-of-holes"&gt;Stephen Greenblatt on the power of the Adam and Eve story&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Think Again - A Big Think Podcast: &lt;/strong&gt;Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds.

      <title>116. Claire Messud (writer) – All These Falls From Grace </title>
      <description>Author Claire Messud and host Jason Gots talk about childhood, growing up, and how cultures contain the things that scare them most. Also, how to give and receive good criticism on creative writing in this, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/"&gt;Big Think&lt;/a&gt;'s latest brain-fertilizing podcast. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/magazine/whos-afraid-of-claire-messud.html?mcubz=1&amp;amp;_r=0"&gt;Claire Messud&lt;/a&gt; is the author of seven novels, including The Woman Upstairs and The Emperor’s Children. Messud has been awarded an Addison Metcalf award and the Straus Living Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, among many other literary honors.

      <title>111. Ari Shaffir (Comic) – The Golden Age of Trolling </title>

Since 2015, the Think Again podcast has been taking us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's guest &lt;a href="http://www.arishaffir.com/"&gt;Ari Shaffir&lt;/a&gt; is a stand-up comic and the host of Skeptic Tank – a super popular weekly podcast that’s on its 299th episode (at this writing). Ari grew up orthodox Jewish, spent two years in a yeshiva in Israel, and then turned into an atheist comedian who did an outrageous web video series called “The Amazing Racist” and runs a yearly “Shroomfest” where he’s like a benevolent Dionysus, presiding over a worldwide three-day celebration of psilocybin mushrooms. He co-created and hosts Comedy Central’s storytelling series “this is not happening”. And he got a two part comedy special on Netflix called “Double Negative”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ari and Jason talk about outrageousness in comedy, bipartisan e-rage on social media, growing up and growing out of bad habits, the transgender bathroom debate, and much, much, much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/barbara-oakley-brain-bias-why-not-to-emulate-geniuses-and-their-rigid-thinking-process"&gt;Barbara Oakley on the rigidity of geniuses’ thinking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/elijah-nealy-the-transgender-bathroom-debate-is-literally-dangerous"&gt;Elijah Nealy on the transgender bathroom debate&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

He works on the history of the Mediterranean, Russia, the Middle East, Persia, Central Asia and beyond, and on relations between Christianity and Islam. Peter's new book The Silk Roads: A New History of the World, is an international bestseller, described by William Dalrymple as a 'historical epic of dazzling range, ambition and achievement'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At an anxious moment in Western history, Frankopan encourages us to take a historical perspective, understanding how change happens in societies and how people typically react to it. This conversation unpacks the fascinating and dense history of the Silk Road countries and digs deep into the economic and social forces that shape our lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/michael-slaby-why-hourly-wages-dont-make-sense-but-a-30-hour-workweek-does"&gt;Michael Slaby on the 30 hour work week&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/michael-slaby-why-hourly-wages-dont-make-sense-but-a-30-hour-workweek-does"&gt;Geneticist Jennifer Doudna on designer babies &lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

You might know him best from Curb Your Enthusiasm, which he produced and acted in as Larry David’s friend and manager Jeff Greene, whose relationship with his wife was one of the most harrowing things I’ve ever seen on television.

      <title>106. Alan Alda (Actor) – The Spirit of the Staircase </title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. Since 2015, the Think Again podcast has been taking us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's guest is actor, writer, director, and science-curious artist &lt;a href="http://www.alanalda.com/"&gt;Alan Alda&lt;/a&gt;. Jason says: "I grew up watching him in reruns of MASH, where his character Hawkeye Pierce was so specific and relatable that he feels in my memory like a not-too-distant relative. And in Horace and Pete, Louis CK’s 2016 brilliant web-tv dramedy, Alan underwent a miraculous metamorphosis into a bitter, racist barman who is also a fully-fleshed human being.&amp;nbsp; But wait - there’s more! For decades, Alan has been helping to heal the ancient rift between highly technical science and ordinary curiosity. Alan’s new book &lt;a href="http://www.alanalda.com/alan_alda_buy_the_books.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Shares what he (and science) have learned about how we can communicate better. It’s no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life or death." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inspired by a passage in Alan's book, Jason puts away his interview notes. What follows is a funny, honest, connected conversation unlike anything else in the show's two-year history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/human-beings-are-information-seeking-creatures-2"&gt;James Gleick - Humans are Information-Seeking Creatures &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>104. Timothy Spall (Actor) – That Double Want </title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. Since 2015, the Think Again podcast has been taking us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001758/"&gt;Timothy Spall&lt;/a&gt; is an extraordinary actor, best known perhaps for the many films he’s done with director Mike Leigh, including Secrets &amp;amp; Lies and Mr. Turner, for which he won best actor at Cannes. You may know him from a number of Hollywood films, too, including the Harry Potter series and The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise. His latest is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18ZN_lZvL7A"&gt;THE JOURNEY&lt;/a&gt;. It’s based on a real road trip that happened in 2006, when two arch-enemies — the heads of Ireland’s warring factions, spent about an hour together in the backseat of a car. This was the prelude to a historic peace deal, cementing the end of Ireland’s long Civil war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode we dig deep into questions like what people really want from their political leaders, whether it's possible (or even advisable) to overcome desire, and whether and when just sitting on a park bench, enjoying a tree, is enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/scott-barry-kaufman-on-capacity-for-solitude"&gt;Scott Barry Kaufman on Solitude&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

Since 2015, the Think Again podcast has been taking us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives. 100 episodes in, like the universe itself, the show continues to expand and accelerate at speeds that boggle the imagination. &lt;br&gt;One of seven siblings, &lt;a href="https://www.paultheroux.com/"&gt;Paul Theroux&lt;/a&gt; is the author of over 50 works of fiction and non-fiction, including The Great Railway Bazaar and The Mosquito Coast. His latest novel &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mother-Land-Paul-Theroux/dp/0618839321/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1497026580&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=Mother+Land"&gt;Mother Land &lt;/a&gt;is a scathing, semi-autobiographical, often painfully funny portrait of a mother’s long and insidious reign over her seven children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, Paul talks about the claustrophobia of big families, the mass migrations of peoples, colonizing Mars, and an important difference between humans and cockroaches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/anders-fogh-rasmussen-on-the-geopolitical-challenges-of-climate-change"&gt;Anders Fogh Rasmussen on the geopolitical challenges of climate change&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/stephen-petranek-on-living-on-mars"&gt;Stephen Petranek on colonizing Mars&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>95. Kory Stamper (Lexicographer) – Lair of the Level 10 Word Mage</title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://korystamper.wordpress.com/"&gt;Kory Stamper&lt;/a&gt; is a lexicographer at Merriam-Webster, often seen on their “Ask the Editor” video series. Her funny and fascinating book &lt;a href="https://korystamper.wordpress.com/word-by-word/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word By Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is about the how the sausage of dictionaries is made, and about the slipperiness of words themselves. This is not a “prescriptivist” manifesto, fussily criticizing people’s misuse of apostrophes or words like “irregardless.” On the contrary, like any lexicographer worth her salt (and salt, as Kory will tell you, was once so valuable it was used as money, which is where we get the word “salary” from…) Kory’s a professional “descriptivist”, painstakingly trying to pin down how words are actually used even as they try to wriggle away from her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/adam-mansbach-on-why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-political-correctness"&gt;Adam Mansbach on the term "political correctness"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/rob-bell-on-the-origins-of-hell"&gt;Rob Bell on the word "Hell" &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>94. Joyce Carol Oates (Writer) – Oh, That's Socialism </title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The writer &lt;a href="https://celestialtimepiece.com/"&gt;Joyce Carol Oates&lt;/a&gt; grew up on a farm, tending chickens in what she describes as a very desolate part of upstate New York, and grew up to write around 90 (and counting) novels and collections of essays and short stories, many of them while teaching at Princeton University. She’s won many, many awards, including the National Book Award, the Pen/Malamud Award and the National Humanities Medal. Her powerful new novel, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-American-Martyrs-Novel/dp/0062643045/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1492200542&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=a+book+of+american+martyrs"&gt;A Book of American Martyrs&lt;/a&gt;, begins with a terrible act of violence – and then deals with its complex aftermath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's conversation starts there, weaving through the political and religious landscape of America, past and present. We also talk about whether writing, for Joyce, is as "effortless" as critics have described the experience of reading her. Trump comes, up, inevitably but briefly. Stick around for a fascinating discussion of the challenges early success can pose for young writers, including Oates' former student, Jonathan Safran Foer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/identity-and-choice-in-the-west"&gt;Gish Jen on Identity and Choice in the West&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/c-nicole-mason-on-poverty-in-america"&gt;Nicole Mason on Poverty in America&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://multiverseaccordingtoben.blogspot.com/"&gt;Ben Goertzel&lt;/a&gt; is a hugely influential computer scientist and author in the area of artificial general intelligence, among others. Just a few of the many hats Ben wears or has worn: Chief Scientist of &lt;a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/"&gt;Hanson Robotics&lt;/a&gt; which makes some of the most advanced robots in the world, Co-founder of AIDYA – artificial intelligence for financial trading, and Chairman of the &lt;a href="http://opencog.org/"&gt;OpenCog Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, an open source project to build a radically new form of artificial intelligence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What's real and what's hype in all the talk about artificial intelligence these days? Will teaching AI to solve humanity's biggest problems keep robots from harming us if and when they become autonomous? Is the human brain, with all its limitations, a good model for AI at all? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode, Ben explains to Jason some of the theory behind various existing and potential AI systems, weighs in on the idea of the Singularity, and touches on his "panpsychist" belief that consciousness is an omnipresent force of nature, suggesting that they drop LSD together at some point to discuss it in depth.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOHWHEJOLU"&gt;Alva Noë: “You are Not Your Brain” &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

Is the human brain, with all its limitations, a good model for AI at all? <br><br>In this episode, Ben explains to Jason some of the theory behind various existing and potential AI systems, weighs in on the idea of the Singularity, and touches on his "panpsychist" belief that consciousness is an omnipresent force of nature, suggesting that they drop LSD together at some point to discuss it in depth.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:<br></strong><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOHWHEJOLU">Alva Noë: “You are Not Your Brain” <br></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>]]>

      <title>82. Bernard-Henri Lévy (Philosopher) – The Mirror of Our Better Selves</title>

The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Washington Post has this to say about today's guest: "There is no American equivalent of Bernard-Henri Lévy. Known as “BHL,” he is among the last of a quintessentially French breed, the 20th century &lt;em&gt;intellectuel engagé&lt;/em&gt;. As a “nouveau philosophe” disenchanted with Marxism, communism and the excesses of 1968, when civil unrest roiled France, Levy has enjoyed a long and theatrical career since the 1970s, embracing journalism, philosophy, film and an outspoken advocacy for human rights."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BHL's films include the documentaries &lt;em&gt;Bosna!&lt;/em&gt; And &lt;em&gt;A Day in the Death of Sarajevo. &lt;/em&gt;Lévy is co-founder of the antiracist group SOS Racisme and has served on diplomatic missions for the French government. His newest book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Judaism-Bernard-Henri-L%C3%A9vy/dp/0812992725"&gt;The Genius of Judaism&lt;/a&gt; explores what he sees as the crucial metaphysical role of Jewish thought and the Jewish people in the life of nations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's episode addresses torture, the question of evil, and the tipping point at which democracy becomes something else.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/paul-bloom-on-dehumanization-and-empathy"&gt;Paul Bloom on Torture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/america-the-superpower"&gt;Ian Bremmer on America as a Superpower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Think Again - A Big Think Podcast: &lt;/strong&gt;You've got 10 minutes with Einstein.

      <title>70. Margaret Atwood (Author) - The Good, The Bad, and The Stupid</title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and &lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today's guest is novelist, essayist, poet, and as of late, comic-book writer &lt;a href="http://margaretatwood.ca/"&gt;Margaret Atwood&lt;/a&gt;. She’s also got some really funny mini-comics about bad interviews, so Jason tries extra-hard to bring his a-game here. She’s the Booker prize winning author of The Blind Assassin, Oryx &amp;amp; Crake, The Handmaid’s Tale, and around 40 other beloved books. Her latest, &lt;a href="http://margaretatwood.ca/books/hag-seed/"&gt;Hag-Seed&lt;/a&gt;, is a total and delightfully wicked reimagining of Shakespeare’s The Tempest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this episode Margaret talks with Jason about genomes in the cloud, Bob Dylan's Nobel prize, the elusiveness of dead authors, and why technology's a three-edged sword.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise conversation starter interview clips in this episode:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/dna-in-the-cloud-2"&gt;Michael Schatz on storing our genomes in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/alison-gopnik-on-donald-trump-narcissism-and-children"&gt;Alison Gopnik on Narcissism &lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>65. Ian McEwan (Novelist) - A King of Infinite Space </title>

      <title>64. Mixtape #4 – The Writers' Room </title>
      <description>&lt;strong&gt;In this episode:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/"&gt;Big Think&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;launched in 2008 as a "YouTube for intellectuals." Since then, it has produced over 10,000 short-form video interviews with many of the most influential and creative thinkers of our time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big Think's videos are bits of "expert wisdom", presented confidently and definitively against a white screen background. With THINK AGAIN, we wanted to revisit these ideas the way the audience encounters them––spontaneously, messily, and often out of context. We wanted to bring the experts to that state some thinkers call "beginner's mind" and see what would happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The format:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Jason sits down with artists, scientists, historians––all accomplished experts in their fields. They chat a bit about the guest's work. Then, they watch three surprise Big Think interview clips (chosen by the video producers), emailed to Jason just before the interview, and discuss them. And the conversation goes where it goes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some amazing moments have happened this past year––fun, profound, profoundly painful. This, the fourth of our first year "mixtapes", focuses on the most memorable bits of writerly wit and wisdom from the first year of Think Again - a Big Think Podcast. With playwright and screenwriter Sir David Hare on (not) resting on your laurels, National Book Award Winner James McBride on writing with a roomful of giant talents, rapper and first-time novelist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://katetempest.co.uk/"&gt;Kate Tempest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on writers' block as "fear of writing", and Nobel Laureate Turkish author Orhan Pamuk on why writing programs should teach writers to manage their own psychology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise clips in this episode:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/the-psychology-of-happiness-and-feedback"&gt;Sheila Heen&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HR22lvBo1rQ"&gt;Bessel Van Der Kolk&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/charles-duhigg-on-the-science-of-productive-teams"&gt;Charles Duhigg&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/augusten-burroughs-on-how-to-overcome-writers-block"&gt;Augusten Burroughs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Think Again - A Big Think Podcast:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;You've got 10 minutes with Einstein. What do you talk about? Black holes? Time travel? Why not gambling?&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Art of War&lt;/em&gt;? Contemporary parenting? Some of the best conversations happen when we're pushed outside of our comfort zones. Each week on Think Again, we surprise smart people you may have heard of with short clips from Big Think's interview archives on every imaginable subject.

      <title>63. Eric Kandel (Nobel Laureate neuroscientist) - The Eye of the Beholder</title>
      <description>Since 2008, Big Think has been sharing big ideas from creative and curious minds. The Think Again podcast takes us out of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and Jason Gots, your host, with unexpected conversation starters from Big Think’s interview archives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this week's episode: Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://kavli.columbia.edu/leadership/kandel"&gt;Eric Kandel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Columbia University and host&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;discuss abstract art, memory, identity, and the nature of evil. When he was 9 years old, Eric Kandel listened on a short-wave radio his brother had made as Hitler marched into Kandel's hometown of Vienna, Austria. The next day, a non-Jewish classmate told him "Kandel, I'm never to speak to you again." In the year 2000, He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for pioneering work on understanding how memory is stored in the brain by studying a particular type of sea snail with a relatively simple nervous system. In his recent books, he’s been pioneering in a different way––trying to bridge the gap between the “two cultures” of the sciences and the humanities. His current book&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reductionism-Art-Brain-Science-Bridging/dp/0231179626"&gt;Reductionism in Art and Brain Science&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;continues this essential work by looking at the ways both modern art and science “reduce” complex phenomena down to their component parts to achieve new insights and effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise "conversation starter" interview clips in this episode:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/janna-levin-on-benefits-of-restraints-in-science"&gt;Janna Levin&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/susan-david-on-psychology-of-fear-and-demagoguery"&gt;Susan David&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/george-musser-on-the-strangeness-of-physics-and-telepathy"&gt;George Musser&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>62. Mixtape #3 – a Soupçon of Ornithology</title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/"&gt;Big Think&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;launched in 2008 as a "YouTube for intellectuals." Since then, it has produced over 10,000 short-form video interviews with many of the most influential and creative thinkers of our time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2014, the podcast SERIAL burst on the scene and Apple put a "podcasts" app in the iPhone's OS, and suddenly podcasting, which had existed for over a decade, was widely considered to have entered its Golden Age (wonder how all the veteran podcasters felt about that...). So Big Think decided it might be a good time to start a podcast, too––to find its voice in this newly energized space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://jasongots.com/"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(who had been a writer and editor there since 2010), more or less leapt out of his chair at the meeting where this was announced and volunteered to create and host it.

      <title>61. Alison Gopnik (Developmental Psychologist) – Artificial Intelligence/Natural Stupidity</title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://www.alisongopnik.com/"&gt;Alison Gopnik&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;is an internationally recognized expert in children’s learning and development. A professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at UC Berkeley, and the author of many books including the The Philosophical Baby. Her new book&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780374229702"&gt;The Gardener and the Carpenter&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a response to the fact that “parenting” has become a verb, a powerful middle class trend, a lucrative self-help industry, and sometimes a kind of bloodsport. Meanwhile developmental science paints a very different picture of how children grow and learn, and what it means to be a good parent.

Since then, it has produced over 10,000 short-form video interviews with many of the most influential and creative thinkers of our time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2014, the podcast SERIAL burst on the scene and Apple put a "podcasts" app in the iPhone's OS, and suddenly podcasting, which had existed for over a decade, was widely considered to have entered its Golden Age (wonder how all the veteran podcasters felt about that...). So Big Think decided it might be a good time to start a podcast, too––to find its voice in this newly energized space.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://jasongots.com"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(who had been a writer and editor there since 2010), more or less leapt out of his chair at the meeting where this was announced and volunteered to create and host it. Thus THINK AGAIN - A BIG THINK PODCAST was born.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big Think's videos are bits of "expert wisdom", presented confidently and definitively against a white screen background. With THINK AGAIN, we wanted to revisit these ideas the way the audience encounters them––spontaneously, messily, and often out of context. We wanted to bring the experts to that state some thinkers call "beginner's mind" and see what would happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The format:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Jason sits down with artists, scientists, historians––all accomplished experts in their fields. They chat a bit about the guest's work. Then, they watch three surprise Big Think interview clips (chosen by the video producers), emailed to Jason just before the interview, and discuss them. And the conversation goes where it goes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some amazing moments have happened this past year––fun, profound, profoundly painful––so this week and next, we're stepping back and taking stock. This, the first of two "greatest hits mixtapes", features author&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.junotdiaz.com/"&gt;Junot Diaz&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on why he's fascinated by double lives, popular philosopher&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.samharris.org/"&gt;Sam Harris&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on monsters in literature, Brain Pickings founder&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/about/"&gt;Maria Popova&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the complexities of friendship, rapper and poet&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://saulwilliams.com/"&gt;Saul Williams&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the Catholic Church and his preacher father, and former pro wrestler and Minnesota Governor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.jesseventura.net/"&gt;Jesse Ventura&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on space aliens. It also includes an original THINK AGAIN song written for us in less than a week by the amazing, inimitable&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://moternmedia.com/"&gt;Matt Farley.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surprise clips in this episode&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/joyce-carol-oates-on-writing"&gt;Joyce Carol Oates&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aziumOp8msQ"&gt;Dan Ariely&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/william-shatner-on-friendship-and-leonard-nimoy"&gt;William Shatner&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/charlene-li-on-pope-francis"&gt;Charlene Li&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwRpQXbsF0k"&gt;Brian Greene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>54. LIVE! Sarah Jones (actor/playwright) – </title>
      <description>&lt;a href="http://sarahjonesonline.com/"&gt;Sarah Jones&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Tony and Obie award-winning playwright and performer. She's unlike any other artist in her uncanny ability to create,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;become,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and instantly switch between characters, convincingly inhabiting their physicality and their consciousness. Sarah's 2004 one woman show BRIDGE &amp;amp; TUNNEL channeled the symphony of voices that make up New York City's five boroughs. She returns this fall to the Manhattan Theatre Club with SELL/BUY/DATE, in which she plays all characters in a sex-ed class from the future that doubles as a brilliant, satirical commentary on life in 2016.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On May 20th, 2016, almost exactly a year after we launched, Think Again did an episode live with Sarah Jones as part of NYC Podfest, at CakeShop NYC. Host Jason Gots knew in advance that Sarah might be slipping into and out of character, but not&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;which characters&lt;/em&gt;, or when. Over the course of the hour, Sarah became and responded to the surprise discussion clips as Rashid, an out-of-work rapper, Lorraine, a Jewish grandmother, Bella, a millennial, and many more. Far from stereotypes, these were fully-fleshed people with brilliant insights grounded in their radically different life experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, it was a hell of a lot of fun for the 100+ people present, and we're delighted to share it now with you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprise clips in this episode:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/douglas-rushkoff-on-creating-value-in-the-digital-economy"&gt;Douglas Rushkoff on collaboration in the digital economy&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/angie-mcarthur-on-mind-patterns-and-attention"&gt;Angie MacArthur on types of attention&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/parag-khanna-global-interconnectedness-might-prevent-world-war-iii"&gt;Parag Khanna on World War III&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

Her first book, &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9781501107832"&gt;Dear Mr. You&lt;/a&gt;, is a series of letters to men, real and hypothetical, living and dead, who have had a meaningful impact on her life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surprise interview clips from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/henry-rollins-music-is-powerful-but-it-cant-stop-a-war-2"&gt;Henry Rollins&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/ralph-rivera-on-3d-and-360-degree-media-2"&gt;Ralph Rivera&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;set Mary-Louise and host&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://jasongots.com"&gt;Jason Gots&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;off on a conversation about the limits of empathy, the power of music, and the fact that likability is way overrated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>47. Kate Tempest (rapper/poet/novelist): Lost and Found in South London</title>
      <description>"When you’re writing a novel, it’s agony. It’s complete agony. It’s a horrible thing to put yourself through.&amp;nbsp;All of the instinctive kind of rushes of creativity, the energized outpourings, anybody can do that. That’s not what makes you a writer. The bit of this job that makes you a writer is when you don’t feel like that. When you feel like you never deserved to even imagine that you could have been a writer. When you hate every word that you’ve made. When you doubt every single part of your brain. To sit down in that space and work because you’ve got a deadline to meet, because you’ve got a novel to write. You know to ignore your brain in that moment, because your brain is defeating you. You have to be able to trust your hand."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;– Kate Tempest, in this episode&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://katetempest.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kate Tempest&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a force of nature. She won the coveted Ted Hughes award for her epic poem&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Brand New Ancients&lt;/em&gt;, which she toured internationally as a stage show to massive critical acclaim. Her novelistic 2014 rap album&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Everybody Down&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;takes hip-hop in entirely new directions.

      <title>45. James McBride (Author) – Fear Sells Many a Car/James Brown is a Noun</title>
      <description>“Fear is just a monster motivator. It sells many a car and harnesses many a vote.”&amp;nbsp; – James McBride, in this episode.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear, says National Book Award winner and New York Times bestselling author&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.jamesmcbride.com/index-flash.html"&gt;James McBride&lt;/a&gt;, was the most powerful force in the life of James Brown, the Godfather of Soul. It drove him to become "the hardest working man in show business", to hoard massive stashes of cash beneath hotel room carpets, and to seek temporary refuge in drugs. It also drove him to leave one of the most astonishing musical legacies in American history, redefining R&amp;amp;B, Soul, and Funk music in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This, along with surprise interview clips from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/charles-duhigg-on-the-science-of-productive-teams"&gt;Charles Duhigg&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/steven-pinker-on-data-and-the-history-of-violence"&gt;Steven Pinker&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/ao-scott-will-virtual-reality-supplant-cinema"&gt;A.O.
