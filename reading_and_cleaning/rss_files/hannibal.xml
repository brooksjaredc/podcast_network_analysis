      <itunes:summary>Hey guys… Tony Trimm here.

On this episode we interview my good friend (Dave) Serengeti who’s credited for giving me my stage name “Trimm.” He’s a prolific and genre-bending rapper/softball pitcher from Chicago that went to the same college as Hannibal and I. He also goes by the alias Kenny Dennis who made the iconic Chicago anthem “Dennehy” and has collaborated with Open Mike Eagle, Anders Holms, Sufjans Stevens and myself. We recorded this one back in July at my apartment and talk about Hannibal’s credit score, Berlin nightlife, lunchables and ordering a deep dish pizza to be delivered 22,000 blocks west to LA from Chicago.

      <itunes:summary>On this episode we talked with Mitski.  She was in town for Red Bull’s 30 days in Chicago. They put on a concert every night in November. We were supposed to release this episode to help promote the rest of the concerts a couple weeks ago but life happens. Sorry about that.  Thanks for the money and the liquid energy during dark sleepy times. We had a fun chat with Mitski.  She’s a vagabond musician. She’s lived all over.  She likes autotune.  It’s a good show!  My energy levels are dipping on this writeup. Should’ve been more descriptive. Ah well. Check out this show!

      <description>On this episode we talked with Mitski.  She was in town for Red Bull’s 30 days in Chicago. They put on a concert every night in November. We were supposed to release this episode to help promote the rest of the concerts a couple weeks ago but life happens. Sorry about that.  Thanks for the money and the liquid energy during dark sleepy times. We had a fun chat with Mitski.  She’s a vagabond musician. She’s lived all over.  She likes autotune.  It’s a good show!  My energy levels are dipping on this writeup. Should’ve been more descriptive. Ah well. Check out this show!

I mean I guess he could've had a baby back then too but he didn't.  You get what I mean.  Don't be weird.  I sent him 10,000 baby wipes because that type of stuff is really funny to me. Destroyed his whole storage situation.   We get goofy and make some songs and talk about martial arts and Jermaine's twin brother.

      <itunes:summary>On this episode we talk to the extremely talented vocalist Eryn Allen Kane.  Is vocalist the right word?  Or should I say singer?  I’m not sure.  I think I should’ve said singer and I just wanted to sound fancier and say vocalist.  They likely mean the same thing.   She’s a Detroit native residing in Chicago and has collaborated with the likes of Prince and Chance the Rapper, and former WWE superstar Razor Ramon.  Ok I made up the Razor Ramon part but what if she had a track with Razor?  That would be crazy!  Anyways, we have some fun and tell some stories, check it out.

We got the opportunity to talk with my good friend Flying Lotus right before his set.  Music, synths, Kuso,blah blah blah.  

Then we also chatted with Animal Collective and John Mills Cockell from Syrinx.  We talked a lot about music but we hit a sweet spot when the discussion got parrot related.  

Thanks to Emmy Parker and the rest of the Moog team for being accommodating and helping put everything together

      <itunes:summary>On this episode me and Tony talk with the Cool Kids.   They're from the Chi and were a seminal part of the new wave of Chicago hip hop.  They set a blueprint for how to build a fanbase on the internet.  They split a few years back and recently reunited.  We actually recorded this one a few months ago and I had to listen for some edits and it was really fun.   We talked about their rise and obstacles and also the conversation somehow veered to sex robot philosophy.   We freestyled and made some goofy songs.  It's a fun ep.

      <description>On this episode me and Tony talk with the Cool Kids.   They're from the Chi and were a seminal part of the new wave of Chicago hip hop.  They set a blueprint for how to build a fanbase on the internet.  They split a few years back and recently reunited.  We actually recorded this one a few months ago and I had to listen for some edits and it was really fun.   We talked about their rise and obstacles and also the conversation somehow veered to sex robot philosophy.   We freestyled and made some goofy songs.  It's a fun ep.

We have deep philosophical discussion about that United flight situation and Kevin's situation with Southwest Airlines years ago.   Of course we end up playing the theremin and I try to get Kevin to license a song of mine.

      <itunes:summary>We talk with the old homie Lil Rel Howery on this episode.  If you're not from Chicago you may feel really weird when we talk about different driving routes.   You actually may feel weird about it even if you're from Chicago. On several occasions I talk about Lil Rel like he's not sitting with us.  We discuss the effect of Get Out briefly but don't delve too much into it because I'm a terrible interviewer.  Rel also gets briefly amazed by the theremin.   Fellow Chicagoan Brian Babylon sits in on this ep.   

Get Out is available on digital May 9th and on DVD May 23rd.

He tells us a couple Richard Pryor stories. He also explains why he moved to Australia from America years ago. We didn't ask him how many bags he checked during the move. That's a huge regret of mine. He's a single man in his 60s and we try to get him to use Tinder and he doesn't want to do it. He's great at talking so we let him do most of it. Enjoy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
