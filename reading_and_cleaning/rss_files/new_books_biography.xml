		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this sweeping new biography, <a href="https://history.dartmouth.edu/people/colin-gordon-calloway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colin G. Calloway</a>, John Kimball Jr. 1943 Professor of History and Native American Studies at Dartmouth College, uses the prism of George Washington&#8217;s life to bring focus to the great Native leaders of his time&#8212;Shingas, Tanaghrisson, Bloody Fellow, Joseph Brant, Red Jacket, Little Turtle&#8212;and the tribes they represented: the Iroquois Confederacy, Lenape, Miami, Creek, Delaware; in the process, he returns them to their rightful place in the story of America&#8217;s founding. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrmK-uub4IRhGwN3OVn0MmAAAAFjNa0L8wEAAAFKAb_eWIE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190652160/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190652160&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=eyckRiXabkzF-nxrRrwKNw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Indian World of George Washington</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018) spans decades of Native American leaders&#8217; interactions with Washington, from his early days as surveyor of Indian lands, to his military career against both the French and the British, to his presidency, when he dealt with Native Americans as a head of state would with a foreign power, using every means of diplomacy and persuasion to fulfill the new republic&#8217;s destiny by appropriating their land. By the end of his life, Washington knew more than anyone else in America about the frontier and its significance to the future of his country.<br />
The Indian World of George Washington offers a fresh portrait of the most revered American and the Native Americans whose story has been only partially told. Calloway&#8217;s biography invites us to look again at the history of America&#8217;s beginnings and see the country in a whole new light.<br />

The book tracks the DeVos family’s accumulation of wealth through the multi-level marketing company Amway, which was founded by her Betsy DeVos’ father-in-law, and the family’s subsequent forays into philanthropy and Michigan Republican politics. Linkins offers a harsh assessment of her push for charter schools in Michigan, and argues she is determined to lower the firewall between church and state in America’s schools. He also explores her record in the federal government, contended she has sided with unscrupulous for-profit colleges and private student lenders at the expense of students. But while the public perception of DeVos is one of an incompetent, Linkins concludes DeVos is a savvy political operator with deep convictions who should not be underestimated.<br />

Truman.  Steven Ossad delivers a highly anticipated, “warts and all”, look at this important man and his legacy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As the thrice-married widow of one of the richest dukes in Victorian Britain, Mary Mitchell lived a life often at variance with the expectations of propriety for her time. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvzX5UfZDp7-1lFqXScKNxgAAAFi_bqRvAEAAAFKAaLf5jI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1527505502/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1527505502&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=VyDEV-uGAxN3Qu8.jcsJ6A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Life and Times of Mary, Dowager Duchess of Sutherland</a> (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2018), Catherine Layton goes beyond the headlines from her time to understand who Mary was and the world in which she lived. The daughter of an Oxford academic, Mary grew up in the interconnected world of the English elite. While her first marriage to an army captain proved unhappy, through it she encountered George Levenson-Gower, the fabulously wealthy third duke of Sutherland, a friend of the Prince of Wales who, like the future king, engaged in a series of extramarital affairs. Soon after her husband’s death in a shooting incident Mary became the duke’s mistress, marrying him within months of the duchess’s death in 1887. The duke’s own death in 1892 sparked a high-profile legal case that even led to Mary’s imprisonment for a brief period, yet the eventual settlement left her fabulously wealthy. Though married a third time to a Conservative politician, as Layton reveals, Mary’s subsequent separation from him before her death in 1912 and her final request to be buried next to the duke serve as conclusive evidence of where her heart ultimately lay.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Lawrence Halprin, one of the central figures in twentieth-century American landscape architecture, is well known to city-watchers for his work on San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square, Seattle’s Freeway Park, downtown Portland’s open-space sequence, the FDR Memorial on the National Mall, and the California planned community of Sea Ranch. Less well known is his distinctive, process-based approach to design—his theoretical commitment, on the one hand, to a dynamic “choreography” of bodies moving through space, and, on the other, the visually arresting notational techniques of “scoring” he devised to represent such movement and carry out his projects in consultation with the public. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgiCpNTqYQlpvgCc7qjEzWEAAAFixVzymgEAAAFKAatjCew/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816679797/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0816679797&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wbhs2uY4ycZR2-1c8nKLnQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Choreographer: Lawrence Halprin in Urban Renewal America</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2014), <a href="https://arch.usc.edu/faculty/alisonh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alison Bick Hirsch</a> addresses Halprin’s built work and community workshops in equal measure, pointing up important tensions that his participatory “Take Part Process” never quite extinguished: between manipulation and facilitation, universality and difference, conscious choice and emergent chance. Through Lawrence Halprin and his wife, the modern dancer Anna Halprin, Hirsch opens onto a broader history of postwar landscape and urban design, and onto some of the complicated politics in which proponents and critics of Urban Renewal alike found themselves immersed. Hirsch has written a decisive work that joins the intellectual, social, political, and aesthetic histories of urbanism. Geographers, historians, and urbanists of many stripes will learn from her able analysis.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In today&#8217;s episode, I am joined by Joshua Parens to discuss his innovative and engaging book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlGLj005uPoB-83wX0M7zQ4AAAFivnAjQAEAAAFKAWhHMYQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1580465536/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1580465536&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=i6U2sZLoOrb0ZakBuL.RJg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Strauss and the Recovery of Medieval Political Philosophy</a> (University of Rochester Press, 2016). While one may easily confuse the book with something narrow or parochial&#8212;who is Leo Strauss and of what relevance is medieval political philosophy?&#8212;our discussion proved to be anything but. In arguing against the commonly held belief that Medieval Philosophy was simply a synthesis of Greek thought with the Bible, Parens reads the works of Alfarabi and Maimonides, two of the most influential pre-modern philosophers, through the works of Leo Strauss, the foremost political thinker of the 20th century. This subtle layering makes for an exciting braided text, cross-pollination between epochs that contextualizes these thinkers on their own terms as well as genealogically.<br />
For Parens, the &#8220;theological-political problem&#8221; at the core of Leo Strauss&#8217; work is neither strictly one of reason or of revelation but rather at the heart of metaphysics&#8212;of being and the relationship between morality and philosophy. In working out Strauss&#8217; unfolding thinking on this problem the reader is guided through competing visions of the study of medieval philosophy and the manner in which Strauss re-centered the work of political thought from a scholastic setting to that of the Islamic world. At its heart lies the question of what Leo Strauss means by &#8220;political philosophy,&#8221; and thereby a long history from Plato through Maimonides and Alfarabi to the present day.<br />

One of the most prolific and iconoclastic commentators on American foreign policy currently active in American letters, Max Boot examines the life and career of General Edward Lansdale, in this detailed and quite personal biography. As he considers the various successes and failures of Lansdale&#8217;s professional life, as well as his role as the inspiration for some of the most telling fictional accounts of the Cold War in Southeast Asia, Boot also develops a context for counterinsurgency that positions strategic empathy as the most essential characteristic for its success. Yet the story of Lansdale&#8217;s life and career is also a riveting chapter in the great American tragedy that is the Vietnam War, one of which Boot offers an unvarnished and stark assessment.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Pedagogue, composer, and conductor Nadia Boulanger was a central figure in Igor Stravinsky&#8217;s life during the middle part of his career, providing him with support, advice, and a discerning analytical and editorial voice when he was writing some of his most important compositions including the Symphony of Psalms and Persephone. Dr. Kimberly A. Francis has recently published two books related to the complicated and tangled relationship between these two people. The first, released in 2015 by Oxford University Press, is <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnACvJOX6h53lQ6wP5wTB-gAAAFitcL-cQEAAAFKAfBEnRQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199373698/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0199373698&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=n0c9IcT1vOuAajdfxvPd-A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching Stravinsky: Nadia Boulanger and the Consecration of a Modernist Icon</a>. Just last month, Boydell and Brewer published Francis&#8217;s edition of their letters in Nadia Boulanger and the Stravinskys: A Selected Correspondence. In other hands, Teaching Stravinsky might have been a simple joint biography, but Francis grounds her work within a theoretical framework that promotes a new approach to musicology and other fields. Building on Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s theories on cultural production, Francis reminds us that as long as musicologists insist on centering their scholarship on the lone composer/genius, someone who is almost always a man, we will miss how creative works are really a result of the complex interplay of networks of influence, and collaborators who participated in individual composers&#8217; lives and music. She positions Boulanger as a participant in the cultural field of musical modernism, who used her position to influence Stravinsky&#8217;s compositions while also promoting and shaping his reputation as the premiere neo-classicist composer. At the center of Teaching Stravinsky is the long correspondence between Stravinsky, members of his family, and Boulanger which spans over forty years. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nadia-Boulanger-Stravinskys-Eastman-Studies/dp/158046596X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nadia Boulanger and the Stravinkys</a>, Francis edits and provides the English translation of most of the letters exchanged by the two friends providing readers not only the source material for her own work, but also an important resource for anyone interested in twentieth-century music. Both books have extensive companion websites. Perhaps most exciting in the Teaching Stravinsky <a href="http://global.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780199373697/">website</a> are the reproductions of pages from Stravinksy&#8217;s scores containing Boulanger&#8217;s comments with Francis&#8217;s explanations. The companion site for Nadia Boulanger and the Stravinskys holds all the letters in their original French.<br />

Tracing the development of a distinctly and catastrophically ideological approach to intelligence gathering through an institutional biography of the SS security service, its operations in Italy, and clashes with rival agencies inside Germany, Katrin argues that Shellenberg&#8217;s ultimate aim was no less than carving out of an independent foreign policy cast in Himmler&#8217;s worldview.<br />

The eldest daughter of Emmeline and Richard Pankhurst, Christabel grew up in a household in which commitment to social reform was stressed as the highest value. Even before her graduation from university Christabel helped establish the Women&#8217;s Social and Political Union, which won national prominence through its pursuit of militant activism. Though Christabel&#8217;s activities forced her to move to France in 1912 in order to avoid arrest, she returned soon after the start of the First World War in order to support her nations war effort. Her belief that such support would earn women the vote partly validated in 1918 with a restricted extension of the franchise to women, yet her disillusionment with the conflict led Christabel to become a Second Adventist by the wars end. As Purvis details, the oratorical skills that made her such a successful campaigner for women&#8217;s suffrage were just as effective in her new role as a preacher, and she continued her efforts on behalf of her newfound faith to the end of her life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In his latest book,<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qv0e7EQ2Aod3-Mt6x4Gx6fkAAAFiWawuKgEAAAFKAWCNzWc/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465032680/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0465032680&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Eu7hOo2i8k7UvwrIqlLhdA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Becoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi </a>(Basic Books, 2017), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Weber_(historian)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Weber</a> highlights the years between 1918 and 1926 as the period in which Hitler&#8217;s worldview developed. Challenging Hitler&#8217;s own narrative, as well as the received wisdom it engendered, Weber puts paid to the idea that the future dictator was radicalized in Vienna or during the First World War. Instead, he portrays Hitler as someone whose ideas were constantly evolving up to and even after he wrote his political testament, Mein Kampf. Using an array of previously untapped sources, Weber offers a nuanced picture of Hitler, presenting him not only as a rabid ideologue, but as a careful and strategic thinker who was prepared to adapt his behavior, even his ideas, should the circumstances require it.<br />

Even as a young girl growing up in Russian-occupied Poland, Rose questioned the limitations imposed her by the beliefs of her time. As a teenager, she resisted the demands of her community and set out on her own by moving to Berlin. From there she made her way to London, where she encountered Robert Owen and embraced his philosophy. Upon her move to the United States in 1836 she became a public speaker and activist, working alongside Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, and others to change public opinion and advance reform. Though Rose saw her efforts to end slavery vindicated with the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, ill health forced her to return to England just a few years later, where she continued to campaign for women&#8217;s suffrage up to the end of her long life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Decision Making in the Age of Abolition</a> published in 2017 by Indiana University Press. In this book Dr. Greene presents us with the biographies of three individuals who lived in the southeastern corner of what is today the Republic of Ghana between the mid-nineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth century. These men became wealthy and prominent in their own communities largely through their trading activities. They had multiple wives and dependents many of whom were slaves. By documenting the lives of these three men&#8212;Amegashie Afeku of Keta, Nyaho Tamakloe of Anlo, and Noah Yawo of Ho Kpenoe&#8212;Dr. Greene examines the different ways in which they confronted the processes of European colonization and the abolition of slavery. As slaveholders, all three had much to lose from these transitions and yet, they all adopted different positions and strategies. What personal, political and economic factors informed these decisions are the central questions examined in Greene&#8217;s book.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Abu Nasr Al-Farabi (c. 872 &#8211; c. 950) a philosopher who wrote on politics, metaphysics, and logic as well as mathematics, psychology, and music, was known by Jews, Christians, and Muslims as the &#8220;second teacher,&#8221; second only to Aristotle. Although little of his biography is known, we have many of his works that were instrumental in preserving and adapting the Greek philosophical heritage in an Islamic idiom in the Middle Ages. Until the work of Leo Strauss and his students, Alfarabi was largely a forgotten figure to modern scholars.<br />
Today&#8217;s podcast is a discussion with <a href="http://www.lsu.edu/hss/polisci/faculty_and_staff/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Orwin</a> about his new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuPZgAjszoKMTA8wfgWllVgAAAFiP3UNrgEAAAFKAYHQLcQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812249046/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0812249046&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Oecx3REzCZESEgPCTEwfgg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redefining the Muslim Community: Ethnicity, Religion, and Politics in the Thought of Alfarabi</a> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2017), a synthetic study across Alfarabi&#8217;s disparate oeuvre that weaves a thematic treatment of notions such as language, nationhood, religion, and politics with an analysis of each of his works in turn. Using the term umma (literally &#8220;nation,&#8221; although inclusive of terms like civilization or community) as a keyword, Orwin shows how Alfarabi strove to recast the Islamic umma as a community in both a religious and cultural sense. This not only provides a gateway into understanding Alfarabi&#8217;s works more broadly, but spotlights his competing loyalties to religion and philosophy. In rethinking the political thought of Plato and Aristotle and demonstrating that their vision of politics was not rendered obsolete by the Islamic faith, Alfarabi, and thereby Orwin, engages in a discourse around nationhood that precedes nationalism and comes to terms with diversity across ethnic, religious, and state boundaries.<br />
Alexander Orwin is an assistant professor of Political Science at Louisiana State University.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When folklorist <a href="https://www.jeanfreedman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean Freedman</a> first met Peggy Seeger in 1979, Freedman was an undergraduate on her junior year abroad in London, while her American compatriot had been living in the UK for two decades. Their encounter took place in the Singers&#8217; Club, a folk music venue that Seeger and her husband Ewan MacColl founded in the early 1960s and to which Freedman returned many times during her London sojourn. After Freedman returned to the States, the pair kept in touch for a while but their contact became increasingly sporadic. However, it began again in earnest when the folklorist emailed Seeger to check some facts for a writing assignment. During their subsequent exchange, Seeger asked if Freedman might know of anyone who would be interested in writing her biography. Immediately, Freedman volunteered herself. Eight years, many interviews, and much text-based research later, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuvO9JCTvCto35F3C3Si9osAAAFiAO3-EQEAAAFKAdf7DwY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252040759/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0252040759&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=KahSoDYJ80Fl6ddZQwDEVQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peggy Seeger: A Life of Music, Love, and Politics</a> (University of Illinois Press, 2017) is the result.<br />
As the book&#8217;s subtitle suggests, Freedman covers multiple aspects of her subject&#8217;s rich story, including Seeger&#8217;s upbringing within a privileged musical family; her relationship with the aforementioned leftwing folksinger and songwriter, actor and playwright Ewan MacColl; her involvement in the production of the groundbreaking BBC Radio Ballads; her musical endeavors, many of which were collaborative; her involvement in the establishment of various initiatives such as the Critics Group, a key aim of which was to help young singers perform folk material in an appropriate manner; and her political activism. Freedman also writes about Seeger&#8217;s return to America in the early 1990s following MacColl&#8217;s death, then her subsequent relocation to Britain in 2010 where she continues to live and be astonishingly active. Seeger&#8217;s most recent album, Everything Changes, was released in 2014, and when this New Books in Folklore interview with Freedman was recorded in March 2018, she already had another one in the works.<br />
Freedman&#8217;s Peggy Seeger: A Life of Music, Love, and Politics is the first full length study of an important cultural figure and has been very well received since its publication last year. A recent review in the Journal of Folklore Research described the book as offering a comprehensive overview of Peggy Seeger&#8217;s life along with an absorbing history of the folk music revival. It also praises Freedman&#8217;s prose for being as approachable and entertaining as Seeger&#8217;s lyrics and informal, intimate performance style.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Though he never enjoyed the fame of his contemporaries Mozart and Haydn, Antonio Rosetti was a successful composer whose works received a wide audience. In his book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkYONLtcdMcU658CRhINx_YAAAFh7HMLDgEAAAFKAYRfKnM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/158046467X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=158046467X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=I46fPoh5JSlqZqOf4b516A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Career of an Eighteenth-Century Kapellmeister: The Life and Music of Antonio Rosetti</a> (University of Rochester Press, 2014), <a href="http://rosetti.sterlingmurray.com/author.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sterling Murray</a> provides readers with both an account of Rosetti&#8217;s career and a style study of his compositions. As a young man Rosetti found employment as a double bass player at the southern German court of Kraft Ernst, Prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein. There he began composing a wide range of instrumental music for the court, eventually rising to the position of kapellmeister for the courts Hofkapelle. A sojourn in Paris in 1781-82 enhanced Rosetti&#8217;s growing reputation by providing opportunities for publishing his music while exposing him to a wider range of styles, an experience which was soon reflected in his compositions. While financial concerns led to his relocation to the court of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1789, his death three years later cut short his career, leaving his achievements subject to the vicissitudes of taste and the changes in musical styles.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Eddie Cantor was once among the most popular performers in the United States. He was influential and innovative on stage, radio, and film from the early twentieth century though the early 1960s. He is not widely known today, however, despite his importance in his time. In a new biography, <a href="https://www.davidmweinstein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Weinstein</a> discusses Cantor, his work, his times, and his politics. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvvWx3rToxHNJMJjoVT7EboAAAFh7ECzMgEAAAFKASIq-60/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1512600482/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1512600482&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ebsNQhZPU079CpGA.1y93A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Eddie Cantor Story: A Jewish Life in Performance and Politics </a>(Brandeis University Press, 2017) explains the many ways Cantor&#8217;s work was representative of the period, but also the ways he pushed the boundaries of entertainment during his career. Cantor was Jewish and unlike many of his Jewish contemporaries in the business, he did not hide or shy away from his background either in performance or in politics.<br />
In this episode of New Books in History, Weinstein discusses his biography of Cantor. He talks about Cantor&#8217;s career and his anti-Nazi activism and the importance of his Jewish heritage is shaping his career and political activism. Weinstein also discusses some of the more contradictory aspects of Cantor&#8217;s career, particularly his use of blackface.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Benedito/Baruch/Benedict Spinoza (1623-1677) lived at the crossroads of Dutch, scholastic, and Jewish worlds. Excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam at 23, his works would later be put on the Catholic Church&#8217;s Index of Forbidden Books. He was a heretic. And yet, he was and continues to be seen by many as perhaps the hero of the early modern period. A figure alienated by the structures that defined his life, Spinoza has been understood, by Jews and non-Jews alike, to have expressed a powerful self-definition that echoes to the present day, where biographies, plays, &#8220;guides&#8221;, and academic works continue to abound.<br />
In place of a simplistic origin story or master narrative of a modernity that begins with Spinoza, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjOWgJi6Vs9fV98oMFN1UZ4AAAFh3RZndAEAAAFKAbx6E94/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691142912/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691142912&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=WLs23qaA1PvukVNqYmL2MA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The First Modern Jew: Spinoza and the History of an Image</a> (Princeton University Press, 2012), tells the story of how Spinoza came to be understood as a cultural hero, a reception history of his image at many crucial junctures in Modern Jewish history. Rather than probing his philosophy or strictly philosophic influence, Schwartz studies a malleable &#8220;Spinoza&#8221; as a symbol that captures the ways in which Jews have sought to understand and define themselves. Beginning in 17th-century Amsterdam before moving to 18th-century Berlin, 19th-century Eastern Europe, and Israel and America in the 20th century, The First Modern Jew is a chronological narrative of modern Jewish history that moves seamlessly between a larger thematic thread and local histories of both the famous (Moses Mendelssohn, David Ben-Gurion, and Yitzhak Bashevis Singer) and the forgotten (Berthold Auerbach, Salomon Rubin, and Yosef Klausner). In so doing, it probes the porous boundary between history and memory: the history of Spinoza and the history of the memory of Spinoza. And thereby we can see Spinoza as the &#8220;first modern Jew,&#8221; both because he was often projected as such and because he was a means by which people have asked the quintessential modern question: what does it mean to be me?<br />

While <a href="http://polisci.rutgers.edu/cb-profile/saladina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saladin Ambar</a>&#8216;s book focuses specifically on Cuomo&#8217;s life, his engagement with Democratic politics, his speeches, it is much broader in scope and in importance as an analysis of the changing dynamics in American politics as the sun set on the New Deal and, in its place, we observed the rise of the Reagan Revolution and the Conservative movement. Ambar examines Cuomo not just as a politician and elected official, but also as theorist about the role of government in the lives of modern Americans. This is why he is dubbed the American version of the Cicero.<br />
Ambar&#8217;s book would be of interest to those who study American political development and American history, American Political Thought, and, in particular, the connection between political parties, electoral politics, governors.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born into a middle-class family in Pennsylvania, his mother worked to ensure that Locke had the best education possible. After graduating from Harvard and spending three years in Europe as the first African American Rhodes Scholar, Locke returned to the United States and took a position at Howard University. In the 1920s he encouraged African Americans to embrace their own cultural past, becoming one of the leading promoters of the Harlem Renaissance then emerging in the country. Though his relationship with its leading figures was often fraught with tension, Locke never gave up his advocacy of Afro-American cultural identity, which he continued for the rest of his life through his writings, his lectures, and his sponsorship of African American artists.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.rutgers.edu/faculty-directory/307-delbourgo-james" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Delbourgo</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qq2ZAgdMdqcD5QkU1BCaI1IAAAFhe1OQoQEAAAFKAaq_gdA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1846146577/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1846146577&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=fzRHPmeTcNu.WQRt7AACog&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collecting the World: The Life and Curiosity of Hans Sloane</a> (Allen Lane, 2017) tells the fascinatingly complex and controversial story of Hans Sloane, the man whose collection and last will laid the foundation for the British Museum, the first national, free, public museum.<br />
For Delbourgo, Sloane was for far too long an overlooked figure, who knitted together the interests of a rising empire through methods of botany, natural history and medicine. Overshadowed in part by his counterpart Isaac Newton, Sloane&#8217;s life synchronizes with the changes from seventeenth-century England to eighteenth-century Britain. His life and the time are deeply interwoven with slavery and a new world of commerce. It was thanks to this interconnected world and the many intermediaries that Sloane managed to accumulate so many weird and wonderful objects from different places. He collected, catalogued, and exhibited them according to his own belief system, which centered around binaries of enlightenment versus superstition and sober empiricism versus magic.<br />
More than anything, Delbourgo&#8217;s book reveals the complex lives and stories around Hans Sloane&#8217;s collection and the many different peoples, places and stories that are attached to the silent objects, even today. It raises important historical questions about ownership and authorship of public museums, collections and curatorial practices and makes them relevant for us today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Described upon his death in 1887 as the ideal diplomatist, Richard Lyons served Great Britain in a variety of roles over the course of a long and distinguished career. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qk6oe9WHX4t_fG_syh3Bc7cAAAFhcUSO3AEAAAFKAUc8DM4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0773544097/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0773544097&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=0w7YjwT3OXfW.867wDeAAQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War</a> (McGill-Queen&#8217;s University Press, 2014), Brian Jenkins describes Lyons&#8217;s eventful life and the often subtle impact he made in international relations. The son of an officer in the Royal Navy, Lyons was long drawn to diplomatic service. Sent to Greece as an aide soon after finishing his education, he rose steadily through the ranks over the course of a series of postings in Europe. Named minister to the United States in 1858, Lyons arrived to witness the emergence of secession, and he spent much of his tenure in America grappling with the challenges posed by the war that resulted. His success in such extraordinary circumstances cemented his reputation and led to his appointment as ambassador, first to the Ottoman Empire, then to France, where he served during the fall of Napoleon III&#8217;s Second Empire and the establishment of the Third Republic. Throughout it all, as Jenkins shows, Lyons set a standard of conduct as a hard-working nonpartisan defender of Britain&#8217;s interests that his successors strove to emulate.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

That it would be his last year as president was not certain at the beginning of it, as he was expected by everyone to run for another term in the upcoming presidential election. Yet as Longley explains, health concerns and the divisions caused by the Vietnam War led Johnson to contemplate announcing during the State of the Union address that he would not seek another term. Even after he made his decision official in March, he continued to pursue an ambitious agenda that included new Great Society legislation, arms negotiations with the Soviets, and the nomination of his friend Abe Fortas as the next chief justice of the Supreme Court. Longley shows how a combination of Johnson&#8217;s lame duck status and events beyond his control often combined to frustrate his intentions, while his desire to avoid a scandal by not publicizing information about the Nixon campaign&#8217;s interference in the ongoing negotiations to end the war in Vietnam only paved the way for the even greater political crises in his successor&#8217;s administration.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

These efforts began with the news of Roosevelt&#8217;s untimely death in 1919, which prompted a wave of assessment as to his legacy. Over the course of the next decade, proposals for memorials moved on a number of fronts, with his widow and children playing a prominent role. Cullinane explains how in the 1930s the resurgent political career of Theodore&#8217;s cousin Franklin prompted a split within the family, as the two sides warred over the meaning of Theodore&#8217;s career and who was best suited to determine it. In the 1950s the approach of the centennial of Roosevelt&#8217;s birth prompted a new round of celebrations and monuments, now increasingly shaped by a generation of Americans for whom Roosevelt was only a memory. The decades that followed demonstrated the endurance of Theodore Roosevelt as a national figure, one whose wide-ranging achievements offered something for nearly every American to admire.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

With particular focus on his conflicted and shifting relationship to Germany and German thought and language, Zadoff contributes to the ever-growing scholarship about Scholem.<br />
Zadoff moves beyond Scholem&#8217;s early ambivalence towards German culture as he sought a Jewish future in Israel during the inter-war years. Despite his early rejection of Jewish-German assimilation and his idiosyncratic Zionist dreams, we find that not only was his world-view framed in reference to Germany&#8212;of his youth, the Holocaust, and the after-war years&#8212;but this relationship becomes a barometer to understand his evolving thought.<br />
The book is divided into three sections, the first of which focuses on Scholem&#8217;s early period in Jerusalem, his political activities there, relationship to the Hebrew Language, and to the Hebrew University. The next section is about Scholem&#8217;s response to the Holocaust and his pivotal role in collecting and reclaiming manuscripts and books that were looted from the Jewish communities of Europe. The last, and perhaps most revealing section, focuses on Scholem&#8217;s &#8220;return to Germany,&#8221; during the last part of his life, particularly his involvement in the Eranos seminars. Zadoff begins the book by asking how the images of Scholem in Israel and Germany could be of the same person, at home he was known as a fiery intellectual, demanding German teacher, and scholar of the kabbalah, while in Germany he was a literary personality and a nostalgic link to German culture of the pre-War years. At its conclusion, we are left with a well argued narrative that does not strip its subject of its complexity.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a United States senator in the 1930s and 1940s, Arthur Vandenberg was one of the leading Republican voices shaping the nation&#8217;s foreign policy. Though initially a staunch isolationist, as Hendrik Meijer explains in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qj7CjNCW0yHqeC7lxsEMM9IAAAFhCksehwEAAAFKAa4WfFw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022643348X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022643348X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wRxBVzKoBQmhtMcTMn9CdA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Vandenberg: The Man in the Middle of the American Century</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017), Vandenberg eventually became one of the foremost advocates for America&#8217;s engagement with the world. As a young man Vandenberg embarked upon a career as a journalist, and soon rose to become the editor of the local newspaper in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Vandenberg&#8217;s platform made him a force in state politics, and his editorials enjoyed a national readership among Republican leaders. Appointed to the Senate in 1928, Vandenberg soon made a name for himself for his ability to compromise on legislation, and with the electoral decimation of the party in Congress in the 1930s he emerged as one of its most prominent figures. Meijer details the ways in which Vandenberg used his stature to shape American policy, from his role in the drafting of the United Nations Charter to his involvement in the passage of the Marshall Plan and the treaty that established NATO.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For many people today, the name Abraham Lincoln conjures up a mental image of a solemn but kindly statesman. Yet to his contemporaries, one of Lincoln&#8217;s defining traits was his humor, which he deployed to great effect throughout his career. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlvgaxLQnVmHLGAk421LI3cAAAFgty3lWgEAAAFKARFkf38/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809336146/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0809336146&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=t85IOLhGM1txi6X-GIBzSQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lincoln&#8217;s Sense of Humor</a> (Southern Illinois University Press, 2017), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carwardine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Carwardine</a> examines the role humor played in Lincoln&#8217;s life. Lincoln grew up in a family of storytellers, and had a healthy appetite for jokes and humorous stories. These he employed both in the courtroom and on the campaign trail in his appeals to people, to the point where he became famous for his wit. As Carwardine explains, Lincoln often used humor not just to amuse his audience, but to offer a moral critique of his targets that could be both gentle and pointed at the same time. Though Democrats criticized Lincoln during the war for resorting to humor during inappropriate times, it served as an important balm to the president as he struggled with the miseries of war and the challenges of reconciliation.<br />

Born in 1616, Owen grew up in an Anglican faith increasingly influenced by Arminian doctrine. Though Owen sided with Parliament during the English Civil War, it was hearing a sermon in London that had a far more profound impact on Owen&#8217;s life by triggering a born again experience. Thanks to a succession of wealthy patrons, Owen rose to prominence during the war, preaching before Parliament and serving as a chaplain in Oliver Cromwell&#8217;s campaign in Ireland. For his support Cromwell appointed him vice chancellor of Oxford University, a post that Owen held until the Restoration led to his removal. Though offered opportunities in Massachusetts colony, Owen elected to remain in England, where he wrote and preached until his death in 1683.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Based on a recently discovered cache of letters between Marie von Clausewitz and her renowned husband, Carl, it also dramatically expands our understanding of the process by which Carl&#8217;s famous treatise, On War, came to be. <a style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;" href="http://clausewitz.com/blogs/VBellinger/2013/06/02/a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanya E. Bellinger</a>, currently a visiting professor at the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, argues that Marie was a crucial foil for the development of Carl&#8217;s ideas over many years. Marie&#8217;s connections to the Prussian court (she was born into the prominent von Bruhl family) also helped to secure her husband&#8217;s often precarious position. Bellinger freely acknowledges Carl&#8217;s military genius but places Marie alongside her husband as an intellectual partner and political confidante, who played an important role in bringing one of the most famous works of military theory to the world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born to immigrant parents, Salk studied hard to graduate for college and earn his medical degree. His interest in helping all of humanity led Salk to pass on a career as a clinician in favor of one as a researcher in the burgeoning field of virology. After work during World War II on the first successful influenza vaccine Salk moved to Pittsburgh, where he soon found himself involved in a coordinated effort to defeat the disease. Salk&#8217;s vaccine became the first to achieve this. Yet as Jacobs demonstrates, the fame Salk won for his achievement came at a price. Though lionized the world over he found himself engaged in a lifelong campaign to prove the superiority of his vaccine, while his efforts to develop vaccines against other diseases never achieved the same degree of success.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Ford</a> (University Press of Kansas, 2017), <a href="http://www.fmarion.edu/directory/kaufman-scott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Kaufman</a> recounts the life and career of this often misunderstood leader. He sees the roots of Ford&#8217;s political ideology in his Michigan youth, where his stepfather and namesake stressed the importance of hard work and individual achievement. After working as a lawyer and serving in the navy during World War II Ford won election to Congress, where he set his sights on becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives. Frustrated in his aspirations, Ford was in the seeming twilight of his career when he was nominated to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president after Agnew&#8217;s resignation in 1973. Within eight months Richard Nixon&#8217;s resignation brought Ford to the presidency itself, where he grappled with the consequences of numerous shifts taking place both nationally and throughout the world. Though Ford aspired to election in his own right, his decision to pardon Nixon defined him to an increasingly cynical populace in ways that ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, contributing to his defeat in the 1976 presidential election.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Abrams</a>, author of the book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnubYgN7jGtlKT7aLYDMSD8AAAFgVp8yIgEAAAFKAZP2tMQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442277637/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1442277637&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=yfw4ker08JkNY1x.jiFSdQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terry Bradshaw: From Super Bowl Champion to Television Personality</a> (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2017). It is part of a series called <a href="https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/RL/RLSIIPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports Icons and Issues in Popular Culture</a>. Abrams, an archivist of electronic records in Washington. D.C., does more than just document the football career of Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who won four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Abrams goes beyond the nuts and bolts of a successful athletic career and explores Bradshaw&#8217;s foray into country and gospel singing, his acting in movies, his adventure as a part owner of a NASCAR team, and finally, his long and successful run as a NFL color commentator and later a studio analyst first for CBS, and then for Fox. Maligned during his playing career for a perceived lack of intelligence&#8212;a prejudicial view of Southerners mostly held by people north of the Mason-Dixon line, Bradshaw played off his L&#8217;il Abner, good o&#8217;l boy image to craft his own niche in the entertainment field. As Abrams writes in this well-researched book, Bradshaw demonstrated what it took for an entertainer to master many of those entertainment industries in the late 20th century. More people may now know Bradshaw as an enthusiastic football analyst, but he is much more than that.<br />

Batchelor has written the first biography of Stan Lee. Starting with his childhood as a Depression-era New Yorker born to immigrant parents, Batchelor follows Lee&#8217;s career as a teenage editor at Marvel Comics, his stint as a playwright for the United States Army during World War II, and his unrelenting work ethic and drive that transformed the comic book industry and brought characters such as Spider Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men to life. Batchelor explores the larger place in popular and American cultural history that Stan Lee has played over the past 70 years from comics to television to film, reflecting on the role of the superhero in the American experience. Well researched, Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel gives insight not only into well-known aspects of Lee&#8217;s life, but also presents readers with little known background into Lee&#8217;s past and what has made him the icon he is today. Batchelor&#8217;s book is a must read for Marvel and comic books fans.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On March 4, 1953, Soviet citizens woke up to an unthinkable announcement: Joseph Stalin, the country&#8217;s all-powerful leader, had died of a stroke. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qol5Oq_7SPC0zG89BshX55MAAAFgN1a_ngEAAAFKAXX852Y/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300192223/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0300192223&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=u9YZJiFCUCMtMvUM9NHQNg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last Days of Stalin</a> (Yale University Press, 2016), <a href="http://joshuarubenstein.com/author/">Joshua Rubenstein</a> recounts the events surrounding the dictator&#8217;s death and the sociopolitical vacuum it opened up at home and abroad. After Stalin did not emerge from his room on the morning of March 1, a maid who was sent into his room found him lying in his own urine; doctors&#8217; efforts to save him, including the application of leeches, proved hopeless. The following weeks brought mass grief and halting attempts at reform, including a mass amnesty of Gulag prisoners. Rubenstein argues that the months following Stalin&#8217;s death were a missed opportunity for a de-escalation of the Cold War. While Pravda published Eisenhower&#8217;s famous chance for peace speech and Soviet officials expressed willingness to negotiate, the State Department under John Foster Dulles viewed Soviet concessions as a moral challenge to resist rather than an opportunity to explore. While Khrushchev went on to denounce Stalin&#8217;s cult and relax political controls, a chance for the peaceful reunification of Germany and relaxation of tensions across Europe was lost.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[With the end of the Civil War, George Crook&#8217;s decision to continue serving in the United States Army meant reverting to a lower rank and assuming a command in the Pacific Northwest. Yet, as Paul Magid details in the second volume of his biography of Crook, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrkJXnOLxqc8oLh88Vk1KB8AAAFgKJGDGQEAAAFKARM3TLU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806147067/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0806147067&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=LM9ZoLvOkUM-DXQ4G07sKg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gray Fox: George Crook and the Indian Wars</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2015), he would soon emerge as one of the most prominent figures in the army&#8217;s ongoing operations against Native Americans in the territories. In describing Crook&#8217;s campaign against the Paiutes in the Great Basin, Magid details the relentless attritional warfare that was a hallmark of his strategy against the tribes he fought. Results in the Northwest led to his transfer to Arizona, where his success against the Apache and Yavapai earned him a promotion to the rank of brigadier general. With his selection as the head of the Department of the Platte in 1875, Crook found himself coping with the deteriorating situation in the Dakota Territory created by the surge of prospectors and settlers, and with the outbreak of the war against the Sioux, the general took to the field in a series of grueling campaigns. Though suffering a setback at the battle of Rosebud, Crook&#8217;s subsequent victory at Slim Buttes led to the subjugation of the Sioux and the surrender of Crazy Horse, which cemented Crook&#8217;s reputation as the army&#8217;s leading expert in Indian warfare.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Driven Toward Madness tells the story of how fugitive slave Margaret Garner and her family escaped to free Ohio in late January 1856, only to be captured in a cabin outside of Cincinnati. What happened as the Garner family were being apprehended is the climax of the story; Taylor shows what drove Margaret&#8217;s attempt to kill all four of her children, while only successfully doing so by way of decapitating her two year-old daughter Mary.<br />
Based in history, Taylor uses various theoretical frameworks like trauma studies, pain studies, black feminist theory, and literary criticism to broaden our understandings of the why surrounding Margaret Garner&#8217;s murder of her child. Taylor broadens popular understandings of black womanhood, resistance, and what are acceptable forms of gendered violence. In doing so, Taylor displays the ways antagonistic groups like abolitionists and pro-slavery activists both used Garner&#8217;s story for their own causes without necessarily recognizing Garner&#8217;s agency and humanity. Ultimately, Taylor expresses how far a person could go to protect their child from bondage, even if that meant taking their life so they reached freedom elsewhere.<br />
Author <a href="http://coas.howard.edu/history/faculty_Taylor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki M. Taylor</a> is Professor of History and History Department Chair at Howard University. Her work focuses on nineteenth-century African American History. Her sub-specialties are in Urban, African American Women, and Intellectual History.<br />

Williams</a>, uses a biographic account of the life and career of Vasily Maklakov to explore issues of legality and rule of law in Tsarist Russia from 1905, following the promulgation of the October Manifesto, which established a legislative body for the first time since the 1600s, till the Bolshevik Revolution. Maklakov, a moderate Kadet (Constitutional Democrat) reformer and practicing defense attorney (most famous for his defense of the Jewish Menahem Beilis, sometimes considered the Russian Dreyfus), was a delegate to the Second, Third and Fourth Dumas who advocated for political compromise, the establishment of rule of law and gradual constitutional reform. He advocated for a wide range of amendments to the Tsarist legal code, especially in the realms of religious freedom, national minorities, judicial independence, citizens judicial remedies, and peasant rights. As such Maklakov&#8217;s policies presented vivid contrast to the political tactics of the better-known Russian Left (the Narodniks, SRs, and Social Democrats) who refused to work with the autocracy and actively engaged in terrorism, at one point killing over 300 government employees a month in 1906, and advocating for the over through of the Tsarist regime. While Maklakov and other liberal reformist Russians ultimately failed in staving off revolution, in part due to the unwillingness of their own party to compromise with the Tsarist regime and accept anything other than a fully constitutional monarchy, Maklakov&#8217;s story serves as an example for movements seeking to liberalize authoritarian countries today&#8212;both as a warning and a guide.<br />

Smith</a>, Assistant Professor of Art History at Michigan State University, unravels the compelling life story of Kiowa photographer Horace Poolaw (1906-84), one of the first professional Native American photographers. Born on the Kiowa reservation in Anadarko, Oklahoma, Poolaw bought his first camera at the age of fifteen and began taking photos of family, friends, and noted leaders in the Kiowa community, also capturing successive years of powwows and pageants at various fairs, expositions, and other events. Though Poolaw earned some income as a professional photographer, he farmed, raised livestock, and took other jobs to help fund his passion for documenting his community. Smith examines the cultural and artistic significance of Poolaw&#8217;s life in professional photography from 1925 to 1945 in light of European and modernist discourses on photography, portraiture, the function of art, Native American identity, and American Indian religious and political activism. Rather than through the lens of Native people&#8217;s inevitable extinction or within a discourse of artistic modernism, Smith evaluates Poolaw&#8217;s photography within art history and Native American history, simultaneously questioning the category of fine artist in relation to the creative lives of Native peoples.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The immigrant son of Hungarian Jews, Fox got his start in the entertainment industry in 1904 as an exhibitor. Enjoying success but chafing under the restrictive terms of film distributors, in 1915 he expanded into production, creating the Fox Film Corporation. As Krefft explains, Fox favored a director-centric approach to film making, working with such legendary figures as John Ford and F. W. Murnau to produce some of the greatest films of the silent era. By the late 1920s he had built a vast entertainment empire, only to lose first his fortune and then his company in the economic collapse at the end of the decade, which left him to watch as others turned his studio into 20th Century Fox, one of the big six studios in Hollywood today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

This was a momentous period for Roosevelt, as he participated in two summits and several other meetings with his allies to dictate the course of the war and the peace that would follow. Yet while noting both Roosevelt&#8217;s deteriorating health and the stress the grueling itinerary imposed on him physically (which was not helped by the travel accommodations of the time), Lelyveld views the claims afterward that his medical problems inhibited his contribution as more often the product of retrospective accounts than reliable contemporary assessments. It was Roosevelt&#8217;s desire to finish the task of shaping the postwar peace that led him to run for a final term, even though many of his closest aides believed that the president was unlikely to finish it if he won. This made Roosevelt&#8217;s health the great unspoken issue of the election, one that determined the selection of Harry Truman as his running mate and defined how the president conducted his last campaign for office.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

This &#8220;cultural biography&#8221; provides a lens through which to comprehend the complex dynamics of indigenous survival and resistance in the era of America&#8217;s early nationhood. William Apess&#8217;s life intersects with multiple aspects of indigenous identity and existence in this period, including indentured servitude, slavery, service in the armed forces, syncretic engagements with Methodist spirituality, and Native struggles for political and cultural autonomy. Even more, Apess offers a powerful and provocative voice for the persistence of Native American presence in a time and place that was long supposed to have settled its Indian question in favor of extinction. This new biography will sit alongside Apess&#8217;s own writing as vital reading for those interested in early America and indigeneity.<br />

Bateson trained in the natural sciences and anthropology, moved to the field of psychiatry and conceptualized the double bind theory of schizophrenia. Leading a research group of scientists and captivated by the possibilities the double bind theory offered in understanding the anxiety of the age, he sought to connect it with other intellectual currents such cybernetics, game theory, evolutionary and communication theory. Working across disciplines, he addressed the modern problem of the distinctions between fact/value, reason/emotion, nature/culture, producing an inescapable double bind for society. Plunging into the paradox of the human condition, he challenged the instrumental view of solving social problems, breaking new ground against binary thinking and in addressing the ecological crisis as a system in runaway. Without appealing to metaphysics, he articulated a holistic theory of mind as a new foundation for thinking about humanity and its relationship to the natural world. Chaney has provided a rich exploration of a fascinating thinker who set the foundations for the information age.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Not very many intellectuals really change their minds about anything. They have a big idea, often become well known because of it. Then their big idea becomes an integral part of their identity and they just never let it go. Evidence that doesn&#8217;t &#8220;fit&#8221; is either ignored or contorted in such a way as to make it &#8220;fit.&#8221; Too bad, that. But, as you&#8217;ll read in <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/agordon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adi Gordon</a>&#8216;s terrific book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QmEDGy6b04hvVJ2lXjBTuv4AAAFfFcvjbAEAAAFKASEMhbI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1512600873/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1512600873&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=EmGNkXv1v1OdUH.u7UWzsQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toward Nationalism&#8217;s End: An Intellectual Biography of Hans Kohn</a> (Brandeis University Press, 2017), not Hans Kohn. He had a several big ideas, most notably one about nationalism. But he never stopped evolving it to, well, reality. Kohn lived in several different worlds&#8212;a Habsburg one, a Zionist one, an American one&#8212;and in each of them he witnessed how nationalism played out in different ways. Kohn adapted as he moved from one world to another, and so did his thought. Very good, that. Listen in to our fascinating conversation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book is rich with detail and one of the few histories to put the vast corpus of Hawaiian language sources to use in understanding the island&#8217;s past. John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s life also serves as a rewarding vantage point for thinking about Hawaiian religion during the early years of the Kingdom of Hawai&#8217;i, and the expanding influence of Christianity. In our conversation we discussed genres of life writing, challenges of reframing Hawaiian modes of thinking into western academic categories, Christian conversion, John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s s upbringing, the importance of family genealogy, the Laplace affair, King Kamehameha and his descendants, Hawaiian language sources, elder years and productive retirement, and John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s importance for Hawaiians today.<br />

Cooper</a> describes how Adams held fast to the values of that generation during a time of dramatic political change. Though aspiring to a career in politics from an early age, Adams sought to win office mainly through merit. Thanks to his ability and experience he served in a series of diplomatic and political postings, culminating in his selection by President James Monroe as Secretary of State in 1817. While Adams succeeded Monroe as president in 1825, the controversy surrounding his election thwarted his ambitious agenda and crystalized the development of a new party alignment that contributed to his defeat four years later. Yet Adams&#8217;s return to public office with his election to the House gave him an opportunity to play a continuing role on the national scene, particularly as the country&#8217;s leaders grappled with the increasingly problematic issues of slavery and territorial expansion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Laura Lee&#8217;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqieucNeEkoxioj2wYyiIC8AAAFfT1DKqAEAAAFKASZvpOM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1445662582/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1445662582&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=6NmbPvesXtIfKxAQ9t61UQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar&#8217;s Ghost: The Battle for Oscar Wilde&#8217;s Legacy</a> (<a href="https://www.amberley-books.com/oscar-s-ghost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amberley Publishing</a>, 2017) offers a detailed investigation of a conflict involving the writer and his two friends with whom he maintained sexual relations, Lord Alfred Douglas and Robert Ross. In her endeavor to disclose the root of the conflict that, as a matter of fact, marked and instigated Oscar Wilde&#8217;s decline, Laura Lee attempts to consider different perspectives, illuminating the progression of the conflict and its influences and aftereffects. This story, although centering around Oscar Wilde, discloses how Alfred Douglass and Robert Ross&#8217;s response to the writers professional and personal turmoil shapes the way the conflict is comprehended.<br />
Oscar&#8217;s Ghost, as Laura Lee mentions in this interview, is inspired by De Profundis: the work that presents Oscar Wilde&#8217;s intimate confession and indicates the writer&#8217;s transformation, triggered by his prison experience. Humiliation, on the one hand, and desire to recover, on the other hand, signal the writer&#8217;s ambiguous perception of his own self. His confessional work, to some extent, captures his ambiguity and offers insights into emotional, psychological struggles that seem to be unresolved. In Wilde&#8217;s case, a confessional endeavor brings forth not only revelation, but pain as well. The process of embracing oneself through revealing the intimate, more often than not, is inseparable from revisiting experiences that involve others. In his confessional letter, Oscar Wilde redefines himself while speculating about his relationships with Alfred Douglas and Robert Ross. Confession is intimate but it is public as well: do those involved in a confession feel comfortable being part of an intimate narrative that is not theirs? As Oscar&#8217;s Ghost demonstrates, this tension between the private and the public cannot be underestimated.<br />
In addition to a detailed account of facts, which at times reads as a detective story, Oscar&#8217;s Ghost also engages with the historical, political, and social realms of London, in particular, and other European cities of the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. By describing the dynamics of Oscar Wilde&#8217;s relationships with Alfred Douglas and Robert Ross, Laura Lee captures the sense of collapse and crisis that appeared to be pervading at a national and international level. The decline of aristocratic privileges produces one of the most powerful influences on the shaping of public ideological and political perceptions, which appear to be intricately connected with Oscar Wilde&#8217;s personal and professional story.<br />
<a href="https://www.lauraleeauthor.com/about-the-author" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Lee</a> is a full-time writer. She&#8217;s authored twenty books, fiction and nonfiction.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born in Russia, Arnautoff&#8217;s service as a cavalry officer for the anticommunist White forces in the Russian Civil War forced him to abandon his homeland for an involuntary exile, first in China, then in the United States. Long interested in a career as an artist, his studies of art in San Francisco during the 1920s led to a two-year period working for the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Returning to San Francisco during the depth of the Great Depression, Arnautoff quickly emerged as one of the greatest talents on the regional art scene, with works that championed the working man and criticized the brutalities of capitalism. Arnautoff&#8217;s embrace of Communism by the end of the 1930s and his association with Soviet consular officials both during and after World War II brought increasing attention from the U.S. government during the postwar &#8220;Red Scare&#8221; era, with their monitoring of his activities ending only with his return to the Soviet Union in 1957.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Born in the Land of Israel around the year 50 C.E., Rabbi Akiva was the greatest rabbi of his time and one of the most important influences on Judaism as we know it today. Traditional sources tell how he was raised in poverty and unschooled in religious tradition but began to learn the Torah as an adult. In the aftermath of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 C.E., he helped shape a new direction for Judaism through his brilliance and his character. Mystic, legalist, theologian, and interpreter, he disputed with his colleagues in dramatic fashion yet was admired and beloved by his peers. Executed by Roman authorities for his insistence on teaching Torah in public, he became the exemplar of Jewish martyrdom.<br />
Drawing on the latest historical and literary scholarship, <a href="http://www.jtsa.edu/barry-holtz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barry W. Holtz</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QmnW37OcFgHjkIq6JRiG0j0AAAFeuqRnyAEAAAFKAXIr8bQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300204876/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0300204876&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=B88xOaxKkqsjtUBgnICqDA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rabbi Akiva: Sage of the Talmud</a> (<a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300204872/rabbi-akiva" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale University Press</a>, 2017) goes beyond older biographies, untangling a complex assortment of ancient sources to present a clear and nuanced portrait of Talmudic hero Rabbi Akiva.<br />

Both men were legends of the American West&#8211;Cody for his service as a scout and prowess in killing bison, Sitting Bull for his role as a leader and his association with the Battle of Little Bighorn. Taking advantage of Sitting Bull&#8217;s relationship with Annie Oakley, another star performer in his show, Cody succeeded in enlisting his involvement, where he proved a popular draw. Though Sitting Bull&#8217;s time with the show was brief, he formed a bond with Cody deep enough to lead Cody to cross the country five years later in an unsuccessful effort to intervene in the events that led to Sitting Bull&#8217;s death.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The daughter of Charles&#8217;s oldest brother Xavier, when war broke out Genevieve found herself buffeted by the dislocations that resulted. In the aftermath of the German conquest, she moved from small acts of individual defiance to full participation in the burgeoning Resistance movement, where she helped to educate her countrymen about her previously obscure uncle. Though her possession of the de Gaulle name often drew unwanted attention from the Occupation authorities, she found daring ways to use it to her advantage. Genevieve&#8217;s arrest in June 1943 led to her detention in the Ravensbruck concentration camp, an experience which as Bowers shows fueled her postwar activities on behalf of her fellow Resistance detainees, as well as her subsequent activism to fight to end chronic poverty.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the third podcast of <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/arguing-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arguing History</a>, historians William J. Cooper and Richard Carwardine address the question of the role presidential leadership played in determining the outcome of the American Civil War. Considering the respective positions of both Abraham Lincoln and his Confederate counterpart Jefferson Davis, they discuss the respective backgrounds of the two men, the political environment in which each of them operated, their relationship to their military commanders, and their contributions to the questions of slavery and emancipation as they pertained to the war. In discussing their abilities and actions, Carwardine and Cooper describe some of the important ways in which the two men shaped the conflict and its legacy for us today, in ways both intended and unexpected.<br />

One of the most important dance artists of the twentieth century, dancer and choreographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Dunham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Katherine Dunham</a> (1909-2006) created works that thrilled audiences the world over. As an African American woman, she broke barriers of race and gender, most notably as the founder of an important dance company that toured the United States, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia for several decades. The author makes the argument that Dunham was more than a dancer she was an intellectual and activist committed to using dance to fight for racial justice. Dunham saw dance as a tool of liberation, as a way for people of African descent to reclaim their history and forge a new future. She put her theories into motion not only through performance, but also through education, scholarship, travel, and choices about her own life.<br />
The book examines how Dunham struggled to balance artistic dreams, personal desires, economic needs, and political commitments in the face of racism and sexism. Katherine Dunham: Dance and the African Diaspora analyzes Dunham&#8217;s multiple spheres of engagement, assessing her dance performances as a form of black feminist protest while also presenting new material about her schools in New York and East St. Louis, her work in Haiti, and also traces Dunham&#8217;s influence over the course of several decades from the New Negro Movement of the 1920s to the Black Power Movement of the late 1960s and beyond.<br />
Dance historian <a href="https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/joanna-dee-das" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joanna Dee Das</a> is a dancer, a scholar, and an Assistant Professor of Dance at Washington University in St. Louis. She is passionate about teaching dance history from a global perspective and linking theory and practice in the classroom. Her research interests include dance in the African Diaspora, musical theater dance, the politics of performance in the twentieth century, and urban cultural policy. She received her Ph.D. in History from Columbia University, her M.A. in American Studies, from New York University, and her undergraduate degree in Dance and History, also from Columbia University. Her writing has appeared in Dance Research Journal, Journal of American History, Journal of African American History, Journal of Urban History, and Studies in Musical Theatre. This is her first book.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[To remember Nathaniel Bowditch today primarily for his famous navigational textbook is to acknowledge only one of his many achievements. As <a href="http://history.buffalo.edu/faculty/thornton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Plakins Thornton</a> demonstrates in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469626934/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Bowditch and the Power of Numbers: How a Nineteenth-Century Man of Business, Science, and the Sea Changed American Life</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469626932/nathaniel-bowditch-and-the-power-of-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016), Bowditch&#8217;s legacy is one that endures in a surprising range of fields. The son of a luckless merchant captain, Bowditch grew up in the early years of the new republic. At an early age he was apprenticed at a young age to a ship&#8217;s chandler, which introduced him to the world of maritime commerce. His aptitude for mathematics led him to identify numerous errors in the standard navigational text he used while on commercial voyages, and his revisions established the book colloquially known by his name today. Yet this was only at the beginning of a long and prosperous career in business, as he moved from commerce to insurance and banking. As Thornton explains, Bowditch&#8217;s mathematically-honed passion for order and precision was employed to systematize traditionally irregular business practices in ways that are reflected in the modern workplace, while his use of trusts to preserve family fortunes ensured the perpetuation of an entire New England social class. Such was his success that Bowditch became one of the Brahmin elite of nineteenth-century Boston society, while his achievements in mathematics and astronomy helped to make him a national icon by the time of his death.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When Dorothy Sterling wrote her book about nineteenth-century black women in America, she stated in the introduction that the book was not a definitive history of black women but a sourcebook to lead others to &#8220;compile a complete history.&#8221; And while a complete history of black women has not yet been written, <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/aads/people/tracy-sharpley-whiting.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting</a> has added to the history of black women in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1438455011/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bricktop&#8217;s Paris: African American Women in Paris Between the Two World Wars</a> and The Autobiography of Ada Bricktop Smith, or Miss Baker Regrets (SUNY Press, 2015). Sharpley-Whiting does two things with this book; she appeals to the scholar and the mystery reader. The first part of the book captures the multi-life history of twenty-five African American women who lived in Paris as artists, singers, club owners, poets, and writers. Sharpley-Whiting&#8217;s stories illustrate how travel and place were transformative for black women despite the length of their stay in Paris. She says, &#8220;the book is a moment in time.&#8221; In this book, we get to go into that world, a world where they were honored and treated not by the color of their skin, but by their talents. We get to meet many different women along the way. Some stayed for a long time, while others could only stay several months before returning back to the United States. By the end of the 1930s, their time was over.<br />
The second part of Bricktop&#8217;s Paris is a noir mystery, titled The Autobiography of Ada Bricktop Smith, or Miss Baker Regrets. Sharpley-Whiting illuminates the lines of fact and fiction in the autobiography of Ada Bricktop Smith. The novel explores the black and feminine perspective of image, self-possession, and self-exhibition. The novel takes us to Paris with black American women in salons and saloons crossing boundaries with purpose, and discovering they are the wealth of the nation. Josie Baker and Bricktop what are they up to? And who did it?<br />
Bricktop&#8217;s Paris was an American Library in Paris Book Award Long List selection and a Choice 2015 Outstanding Academic Title. Sharpley-Whiting is the Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Distinguished Professor of African American and Diaspora Studies and French at Vanderbilt University where she also chairs African American and Diaspora Studies and directs the Callie House Center for the Study of Global Black Cultures and Politics. She publishes an academic murder mystery series under the nom de plume Tracy Whiting. She also teaches a course on Detective Fiction at Vanderbilt. The first novel, an academic cozy-thriller set in the South of France with Professor Havilah Gaie, is titled The 13thFellow: A Mystery in Provence (BooksbNimble Press, May 2015). She has completed the second mystery in this series, Paris A-Go-Go (Books nimble Press, forthcoming 2016), and is currently at-work on a scholarly volume, A Quartet in Four French Movements: A Voodoo Queen, A French Romantic, a Poet, and an African Ethnologist, as well as a family history. She is on the Executive Council of the Modern Language Association (2014-2018).<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199731616/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Martyr of Liberty: Crispus Attucks in American Memory </a>(<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/first-martyr-of-liberty-9780199731619?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2017) explores how Crispus Attucks&#8217; death in the 1770 Boston Massacre led to his achieving mythic significance in African Americans&#8217; struggle to incorporate their experiences and heroes into the mainstream of the American historical narrative. While the other victims of the Boston Massacre have been largely ignored, Attucks is widely celebrated as the first to die in the cause of freedom during the era of the American Revolution. He became a symbolic embodiment of black patriotism and citizenship.<br />
First Martyr of Liberty traces Attucks&#8217; career through both history and myth to understand how his public memory has been constructed through commemorations and monuments; institutions and organizations bearing his name; juvenile biographies; works of poetry, drama, and visual arts; popular and academic histories; and school textbooks. There will likely never be a definitive biography of Crispus Attucks since so little evidence exists about the man&#8217;s actual life. While what can and cannot be known about Attucks is addressed here, the focus is on how he has been remembered variously&#8211;as either a hero or a villain&#8211;and why at times he has been forgotten by different groups and individuals from the eighteenth century to the present day.<br />
<a href="https://wmich.edu/history/directory/kachun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitch Kachun</a> is Professor of History at Western Michigan University. He studied anthropology at Penn State University and studied history at Illinois State University before earning his M.A. and Ph.D. in history from Cornell. Kachun&#8217;s research focuses on how African Americans during the 19th and 20th centuries used historical writing and public commemorations to work for equal rights, construct a sense of collective identity, and claim control over their status and destiny in American society. His first book was Festivals of Freedom: Memory and Meaning in African American Emancipation Celebrations, 1808-1915, and he was the co-editor of The Curse of Caste; or the Slave Bride: A Rediscovered African American Novel by Julia C. Collins. After First Martyr of Liberty Mitch Kachun&#8217;s next book-length project will be a biographical accounting of the early 20th Century African-American journalist Charles Stewart, tentatively titled The Life and Times of Colonel J. O. Midnight.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Addie Wyatt stands at the intersection of unionism, feminism, and civil rights activism in post-World War II America. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0252081994/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reverend Addie Wyatt: Faith and the Fight for Labor, Gender, and Racial Equality</a> (<a href="http://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/54fqt7px9780252040528.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Illinois Press</a>, 2016), Marcia Walker-McWilliams recounts her life within the context of a nation she helped to change. Born in Mississippi, Addie Cameron grew up in Chicago, where despite her skills as a typist she could only find employment on the floor of a meatpacking plant. As a member of the interracial United Packinghouse Workers of America, she soon moved full time into union work, organizing workers and fighting for their rights. In her capacity as a union official she began a lifelong participation in the civil rights movement by raising funds on behalf of Montgomery Improvement Association during the 1955 bus boycott campaign, and in the 1970s formed coalitions designed to promote African American and female participation in the labor movement. As Walker-McWilliams demonstrates, throughout the many struggles she undertook Addie Wyatt&#8217;s faith was an important constant, providing her with a set of values and a source of emotional strength that helped her to persevere against the difficulties she faced.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://womensstudies.barnard.edu/profiles/rosalind-rosenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosalind Rosenberg</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019065645X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Crow: The Life of Pauli Murray</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017) is a multi-layered and rich biography of Pauli Murray, an activist, lawyer and Episcopal priest whose life intersected with the most significant civil and human rights issues of the twentieth century. As a mixed raced woman who felt that her identity was at odds with her body before transsexual had become part of the popular consciousness, Murray&#8217;s life provides insight into a lived intersectionality of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Beginning with her southern upbringing, we follow Murray through multiple educational, vocational and identity challenges she suffered. In a journey through a dislocated life, she contributed to multiple movements and institutions working with many key social leaders such as Thurgood Marshall, Eleanor Roosevelt and Betty Friedan. Appearing as a one-person social movement with a deep religious faith she pursued justice not only for herself but also for others. Rosenberg has provided sympathetic insight into the personal cost that Murray incurred on the road to a more equitable society. Rosalind Rosenberg is Professor of History Emerita at Barnard College.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The daughter of the emperor Theodosius I, Galla Placidia successfully navigated the tumultuous politics of the late Roman Empire to rule as regent for her son Valentinian III. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421417006/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rome&#8217;s Christian Empress: Galla Placidia Rules at the Twilight of the Empire</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015), Joyce Salisbury details the extent of this accomplishment by situating it within the context of her time. Orphaned at an early age, Placidia grew up in the household of Stilicho, a Vandal general who had established himself as the most powerful figure in the western Empire. The sacking of Rome in 410 made her the captive of the victorious Goths, eventually marrying their leader Ataulf. After the tragic death of their son and Ataulf&#8217;s subsequent assassination brought her hopes of establishing a Romano-Gothic dynasty to an end, she was forced by her ruling half-brother Honorius to marry his general Constantius III.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The influential yet controversial psychiatrist, Harry Stack Sullivan was pioneering in his treatment of schizophrenia however the way he lived privately did not always correspond to the theoretical ideas he espoused publicly. With meticulous research and access to clinical and historical records, historian<a href="http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/naoko-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naoko Wake</a>, examines the life and work of this pioneer of American Psychoanalysis from an unconventional perspective, quite different than the usual biographical approach. In this interview we discuss Sullivan&#8217;s sometimes contradictory life work, especially his time at Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, his private practice in New York, and his wider, global ambitions later in life.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813549582/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Private Practices: Harry Stack Sullivan, the Science of Homosexuality, and American Liberalism</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2011), is compelling book and a welcome addition to the historical record of American Psychoanalysis.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The work of Moses Mendelssohn (1729-1786), one of Judaism&#8217;s great philosophers and defenders, has nonetheless defied easy categorization or definitive depiction. While advocating for the granting of full rights to the Jews of Germany, Mendelssohn also was cast in the role of defender of the faith and advocate for continued obedience to what he termed &#8220;ceremonial law&#8221; or &#8220;divine legislation.&#8221; In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0253023742/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moses Mendelssohn&#8217;s Living Script: Philosophy, Practice, History, Judaism</a> (<a href="http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=808206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana University Press</a>, 2016), <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/jewishstudies/faculty-and-staff/faculty/elias-sacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elias Sacks</a>, Assistant Professor of Religious Studies and Jewish Studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, delves into Mendelssohn&#8217;s Hebrew and German works to develop a comprehensive perspective on Jewish practice, Jewish citizenship, and Jewish history. Professor Sacks pays careful attention to Mendelssohn&#8217;s historical context and the influence on his work of late Enlightenment philosophy, Christian theology, and emerging scientific models of thought.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_Kief_Hillsbery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kief Hillsbery</a>&#8216;s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0547443315/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Empire Made: My Search for an Outlaw Uncle Who Vanished in British India</a> (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2017) follows the career of Nigel Halleck, an English tax assessor in employ of the British East India Company and his travels on the Indian frontier from 1841 to 1878. Hillsbery reconstructs his ancestor&#8217;s life through his own travels to the region in the late 1970s. Believed by his family to be a gentleman gone rogue, gem smuggler, or possibly eaten by a tiger, Hillsbery unravels a fascinating tale of a man who choked under the stifling conditions of Victorian cultural norms and set out to reinvent himself at the court of Nepal during its years of self-imposed isolation.<br />
A man with limited horizons for economic and social advancement in Victorian England, Halleck was obliged to seek employment with the Company. Seeking a life of adventure and self-expression on the other side of the world, Halleck instead found a life of shallow colonial routine in Calcutta. Halleck chaffed under the rules and regulations Company bureaucracy. He became increasingly alienated by his surroundings and began to question the racist assumptions of the British imperial project. Inspired by the career of Henry Lawrence, Halleck left the shadow of Company in search of his own autonomy in Nepal, a distant locale outside the reach of British rule. A linguist and explorer, Hallack became one of the first Europeans to visit the country. Under the Rana court, Halleck found his place as advisor and companion to Jang Bhadur Rana during a period of political reform.<br />
Empire Made is an imperial history constructed from fragments of family letters, archival research, and the author&#8217;s own extensive travel in the frontier regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan. Hillsbery reconstructs the life of his ancestor while finding many parallels with his own experiences on the Indian frontier as a young man. In search of his uncle&#8217;s grave, Hillsbery uncovers the mysteries of Nigel Hallack, a nonconformist who transgressed the boundaries of colonizer and colonized as well as European attitudes towards homosexuality in the Age of Empire.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[To remember Patrick Henry for his defiant declaration &#8220;Give me liberty or give me death!&#8221; is to overlook a long career spent as an advocate for the rights of Americans, first as colonists and then as citizens. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/143919081X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty</a> (Simon and Schuster, 2017), <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Jon-Kukla/71494925" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Kukla </a>describes the course of Henry&#8217;s eventful life and how he developed his views on individual rights and other matters. The son of Virginia planters, as a young man Henry turned to the law to earn his living. His arguments in the famous &#8220;Parson&#8217;s Cause&#8221; legal case foreshadowed his case for colonial rights during the Stamp Act crisis, which cemented his standing as one of the leading opponents of Britain&#8217;s efforts to impose taxes upon the colonies. Henry was at the forefront of Virginia&#8217;s move towards independence in 1775, and as its first elected governor he led the commonwealth during years of crisis and turmoil. This experience, as Kukla explains, helped define his opposition to ratifying the Constitution in 1787-8, an opposition which the documents proponents addressed by agreeing to include the Bill of Rights which it possesses today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The conquest of the Philippines in 1942 brought thousands of Americans under the control of the empire of Japan. While most of them were interned or imprisoned for the duration of the war, a remarkable few evaded capture and fought on against the Japanese. In<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0525429654/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MacArthur&#8217;s Spies: The Soldier, the Singer, and the Spymaster Who Defied the Japanese in World War II</a> (Viking, 2017), <a href="http://www.petereisner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peter Eisner</a> describes the efforts of three of them John Boone, Claire Phillips, and Chick Parsons to incite an insurgency against the Japanese occupation. Facing long odds, they risked their lives to undermine Japan&#8217;s control, with Claire&#8217;s Manila nightclub supplying resources and information to Boone in the nearby countryside and the intelligence passed on to Chick and other officers working towards America&#8217;s return to the Philippines. Their efforts in association with that of others provided American and Filipino guerrillas with much-needed material, and smuggled in food and supplies to thousands of prisoners of war the Japanese held on Luzon. As Eisner reveals, while their efforts aided America&#8217;s eventual reconquest of the islands, it came at personal cost to them as it did for so many others, who faced detention, torture, and even death for their actions.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lemoyne.edu/Learn/Our-Faculty/History/Leigh-Fought" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leigh Fought</a> is an assistant professor of history at Le Moyne College. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199782377/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017) offers a detailed and rich portrait of Frederick Douglass&#8217; private and public life and his many relationships with women. From his enslaved mother Harriet, Sophia Auld the slave mistress that sparked his interest in reading, to his wife of forty-four years Anna Murray, daughter Rosetta and his white second wife Helen Pitts; these were the women who populated his private world. From each he learned lessons about the workings of race, gender and class in America and prepared him to collaborate with many antislavery women including Julia Griffiths, Maria Weston Chapman and Amy Post. He saw his fight for abolition as part of &#8220;woman&#8217;s cause&#8221; bringing him into contact with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Seeing himself as &#8220;woman&#8217;s rights man,&#8221; who had attended the Seneca Falls Woman&#8217;s Rights Convention in 1848, he was perplexed by the betrayal of many woman&#8217;s rights advocates. Fought fills in much of what is lacking in the female &#8220;empty space&#8221; in the study of Douglass allowing a fuller understanding of his life and ideas. This is an invaluable contribution to Douglass studies.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 218 BCE, the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca launched an invasion of Italy designed to bring the Roman Republic to its knees. Yet for all of his success in defeating Rome&#8217;s legions on the battlefield, Hannibal ultimately failed in his lifelong goal. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439102171/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannibal</a> (Simon and Schuster, 2017), Patrick N. Hunt recounts the triumphs and frustrations of the legendary commanders dramatic military career. The son of a Carthaginian leader who fought Rome in the First Punic War, Hannibal was raised to reverse Carthage&#8217;s loss in that initial conflict. This he did by taking the fight to Rome, where his outnumbered armies triumphed over the Romans in three successive battles. Yet, as Hunt explains, Rome soon learned from Hannibal&#8217;s example, and the Carthaginians&#8217; inability to translate battlefield victories into a Roman surrender left him mired in a war of attrition he could not win. By the time he faced a Roman army at Zama in 202 BCE, the situation was now reversed, as Scipio Africanus used many of Hannibal&#8217;s own tactics against him. In this Hunt exposes the irony of Hannibal&#8217;s life, as his effort to destroy Rome&#8217;s nascent empire only made it stronger, setting the stage for the next seven centuries of its domination of the Mediterranean.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1438458347/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing the Burden: Rabbi Sim&#7717;ah Zissel Ziv and the Path of Musar</a> (SUNY Press, 2015), <a href="https://www.elon.edu/e/directory/profile.html?user=gclaussen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoffrey D. Claussen</a> provides a thorough study of the life and work of one of the most influential figures in the history of Musar, the Jewish discipline for ethical development. Sim&#7717;ah Zissel (1824-1898), also known as the Alter of Kelm, uniquely combined traditional Talmud study, contemplative exercises, Musar, and general studies curricula at his Talmud Torah in the Lithuanian town of Kelm. Professor Claussen, Lori and Eric Sklut Emerging Scholar in Jewish Studies, and Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at Elon University, breaks new ground in tracing the development and legacy of one of Musar&#8217;s great masters. This book is a welcome and needed addition to the study of the Musar movement and its seminal figures.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/3319393324/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balzac, Literary Sociologist</a> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016), <a href="http://distinguishedprofessors.ku.edu/professor/pasco-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allan H. Pasco</a> explores the talents of the writer whose reputation has been primarily based on his extraordinary gift to compose captivating stories. In his meticulously conducted research, Allan Pasco argues that Honor de Balzac was not only a storyteller: he was &#8220;a sociologist avant l&#8217;heure&#8221; (113) and &#8220;a competent historian&#8221; (234).<br />
Balzac, Literary Sociologist offers a detailed analysis of more than ten literary pieces. While emphasizing Balzac&#8217;s mastery in managing plots and narratives, Allan Pasco invites his readers to pay close attention to the aspects that help reconstruct historical and sociocultural environments of nineteenth-century France. Undergoing a tumultuous period that involved a number of deep, drastic and dramatic changes, France was struggling with the rudiments of the past that were holding back the development of the country; at the same time, new developments did not effectively contribute to the construction of a stable society: a vision of the future was blurry.<br />
A conflict of the old and the young, involving a wide array of themes and motives, appears to epitomize the disruptions defining nineteenth-century French society. Poverty, corruption, ambitions of the aristocracy, despair of the poor signaled the old&#8217;s inability (and lack of willingness and desire) to implement new and productive changes; the young, on the other hand, more often than not lacked knowledge and experience to overcome stagnation. Moreover, disruptions were augmented by the loss of moral virtues: honesty, benevolence, dignity, kindness, love were often sacrificed for money that became a new god. In his analysis, Allan Pasco offers a new reading of Balzac&#8217;s works which can be considered acute and insightful commentaries on the phenomena outlining a transformational period in the history of French society. In addition to the predictable topics (class, aristocracy, church and religion, the rich and the poor, etc.), Balzac, Literary Sociologist includes insightful explorations of topics which appear to be rather symptomatic in terms of the society&#8217;s crises: suicide, failed marriages, fatherless children, the stagnation of the province and the hardships of the city life. Allan Pasco also draws attention to Balzac&#8217;s comments on life in Paris: Paris is presented as a significant locus epitomizing struggles of the country and of the individual.<br />
Undoubtedly, historical and sociocultural permutations involve not only society but the individual as well. As Allan Pasco&#8217;s research demonstrates, Balzac through his individual stories, which, at a larger scale, constitute an extensive vision of the society and the world, was responding to the historical environment that was shaping the individuals inner world. From this perspective, Balzac&#8217;s works highlight the interconnectedness of the inside and outside worlds: captivating stories are pretexts to sociological and philosophical speculations and observations. In his book, Allan Pasco states that Balzac was a sociologist and a historian: in this interview, the author adds that Balzac was &#8220;a great historian.&#8221; Balzac, Literary Sociologist proves inexhaustible potential and power of literature.<br />
Allan H. Pasco is the Hall Distinguished Professor of Nineteenth-Century Literature at the University of Kansas.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As president John F. Kennedy enjoyed a remarkable degree of popularity, and in the decades since his assassination his standing has only grown in the public imagination. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107186994/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Afterlife of John Fitzgerald Kennedy: A Biography </a>(Cambridge University Press, 2017), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hogan_(academic)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael J. Hogan</a> describes how Kennedy came to enjoy such an enduring stature for so many Americans. He traces the origins of this to Kennedy&#8217;s efforts as president to create what Hogan terms a &#8220;Kennedy brand,&#8221; an image of charm, culture, and youthful optimism that appealed to millions of people. In this he was aided by his wife Jacqueline, who as first lady cultivated an aura of style and taste. With her husband&#8217;s death she quickly emerged as the foremost protector of his image by staging his funeral in such a way as to link him to his illustrious predecessors Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. This soon proved only the first of a series of memorials and publications generated in tribute to America&#8217;s 35th president, much of it supervised or controlled by the Kennedy family and their circle of friends. Their success in managing his public image is evident today in the esteem in which Kennedy continues to be held by so many people, even with the emergence of a more nuanced assessment of his time in office.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>Mitchell Stephens‘s new book, The Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th Century Journalism (St. Martins Press, 2017), could be described, in part, as an entertaining book of stories about a legendary American storyteller. Stephens,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://journalism.nyu.edu/about-us/profile/mitchell-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitchell Stephens</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137279826/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th Century Journalism</a> (St. Martins Press, 2017), could be described, in part, as an entertaining book of stories about a legendary American storyteller.<br />
Stephens, professor of journalism at New York University, traces Lowell Thomas&#8217;s long career from his early days in the rough and tumble world of Chicago newspapers to his later fame as one of America&#8217;s earliest and longest-running radio newscasters and its first TV news host.<br />
Stephens tells how Thomas documented the First World War, weaving together photos, films and his own remarkable gift for oratory in multimedia presentations that he delivered live to two million people in theaters all over the world. It was Lowell Thomas who first reported the war exploits of Lawrence of Arabia, making both T.E. Lawrence and Thomas himself household names.<br />
As a journalism historian and author of the previous book, A History of News, Mitchell Stephens argues that Lowell Thomas helped invent the fact-based, authoritative and non-partisan style that characterized American journalism in the 20th century. In this interview with the New Books Network, Stephens talks about how Lowell Thomas forged a path as a broadcast celebrity that was later followed by his CBS colleague Edward R. Murrow and such TV anchors as Walter Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley and Tom Brokaw.<br />

Gygax&#8217;s story and the tale of D and D&#8217;s genesis is ideally suited to the graphic novel format, and Kushner &#8212; who met and even gamed with Gygax &#8212; conveys these twin narratives well. Shadmi&#8217;s illustrations blend the mundane with the fantastical, and the striking cover art alone is sure to win Rise of the Dungeon Master a place on many comic collectors&#8217; shelves. I happily recommend it to anyone looking for a short overview of the subject, and certainly anyone with a love of both comic books and D and D.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Ever   since their composition in the 13th century the poems of the Persian writer Rumi have enthralled millions of readers around the world. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061999148/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rumi&#8217;s Secret: The Life of the Sufi Poet of Love </a>(Harper, 2017), <a href="http://bradgooch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Gooch</a> describes the life of their author and the path that took him from scholarship to poetry. The son of a scholar and cleric, Rumi traveled extensively as a child and enjoyed a wide-ranging education that prepared him for a life as a teacher and jurist. His meeting with the traveling mystic Shams of Tabriz transformed Rumi&#8217;s life, as he soon abandoned his education and responsibilities in favor of immersion into a life of aestheticism. As Gooch explains, it was this relationship which sparked Rumi&#8217;s development into the poet he became, as his deep and passionate relationship with Shams created a wellspring of emotions that were subsequently embodied in some of the most enduring verses ever written.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Whether you&#8217;re on the right or the left of the political spectrum, I&#8217;ll bet that lately the Office of the President isn&#8217;t far from your mind. Every day, it seems, I encounter one, two, three, four stories about President Trump, which includes those on Twitter that he posts himself. For me, as the stories keep coming, so do the questions. Who is this guy? How is this guy President? And, by extension, just who can be President&#8211;what kind of character or lack of character makes a person right for the Office?<br />
My questions aren&#8217;t new, even if our current President raises them in new and, for me at least, disturbing ways. Theres an entire subgenre of literature devoted to them. The presidential biography aims to give readers a sense of who a given President is, of the man behind&#8211;and before&#8211;the Office. These biographies are usually cradle-to-grave tomes or at least cradle-to-end-of-term, written with the idea that a President&#8217;s early life somehow shapes his political destiny. Theres even a version of this subgenre written for children, so kids can learn how to be like the young George Washington or the young Abe Lincoln, confessing about a chopped cherry tree or returning a penny to an old lady. Here the idea is that, if our kids model themselves on the early characters of these Presidents, they too might someday hold our nation&#8217;s highest office.<br />
In his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1944853251/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forty-Four American Boys: Short Histories of Presidential Childhoods</a> (<a href="http://outpost19.com/44AmericanBoys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outpost19</a>, 2017), <a href="http://www.keyholepress.com/authors/william-walsh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Walsh</a> explores not only these assumptions, but also the literature that&#8217;s built upon them. To create it, he read through hundreds and hundreds of presidential biographies, from Washington to Trump, and out of that experience assembled a singular book, one that takes us across 285 years of American history and into the boyhoods of forty-four men who shaped it, since 1801, from The White House. The result is fascinating: Walsh didn&#8217;t write a single word of it, and yet his book is clearly the result of a consummate literary talent.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Public scholarship takes many forms, from op-eds to activism to blog posts. In their new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231181027/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Down the Up Staircase: Three Generations of a Harlem Family</a> (Columbia University Press, 2017), Associate Professor <a href="http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/people/bdhaynes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruce Haynes</a> and freelance writer, developmental editor, and educator Syma Solovitch (both co-authors and a married couple) use a &#8220;sociological memoir&#8221; to show a variety of social science concepts in the fields of urban studies, social class, and race.<br />
The subject is Haynes&#8217;s family, whose members were at the heart of several key events, periods, and organizations in African American life in the twentieth century. His grandfather was a leading scholar of the Great Migration and founded the National Urban League, while his grandmother was a noted children&#8217;s book author of the Harlem Renaissance. The couple became members of the new black Harlem. His parents, who made great sacrifices, such as the gradual deterioration of their house, to send their three sons to private school, resembled the tenuous position African Americans held in the middle class. And Haynes and his brothers came of age in an equally exciting and dangerous period in New York City&#8217;s history: the turbulence of the 60s, decline of the 70s, and devastation of the 80s. Interweaving a variety of sociological concepts and historical examinations with intimate portraits of this singular family, Down the Up Staircase takes readers on an entertaining and provocative tour of twentieth-century urban America.<br />

Alsbeg&#8217;s radicalism was a constant of his life from an early age, and led him to abandon his initial employment as a lawyer for more fulfilling work as a journalist and author. After several years in revolution-plagued eastern Europe as a correspondent during and after the First World War, Alsberg returned to the United States to become a theater producer. Despite the success of his English-language translation of the play The Dybbuk, by the time the Great Depression hit in the early 1930s Alsberg was facing the same challenges as millions of other Americans in finding work. Not only did the New Deals Federal Writers&#8217; Project provide him with employment but, as DeMasi demonstrates, with projects such as the multivolume American Guide and the compiling of the oral histories of former slaves he shepherded some of the most enduring cultural legacies of the era, ones which serve as monuments to his own blend of political values and artistic creativity.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born in Ireland, the young James O&#8217;Brien was a fortunate beneficiary of a progressive education and studied for a career in the law. Yet O&#8217;Brien was soon drawn into a career as a journalist, where, adopting the pen name Bronterre, he advocated for the radical causes of his day. This culminated in O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s involvement in the pioneering Chartist movement, which failed to pressure Parliament to undertake reforms but paved the way for the modern democratic system that exists in Britain today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Farnsworth spent most of his career as a foreign correspondent and both he and his father worked at the same time at the New York Times.<br />
In the book he shares what it was like to cover historical events and grow up in the shadow of his father&#8217;s career. The book features stories about unique encounters with notable people, such as Amelia Earhart and Winston Churchill as well as personal vignettes of a real-life family in the twentieth century. Tangled Bylines provides unique perspectives on the transformations and consistencies in journalism from the 1920s through to the digital age. It provides a foundation for understanding a specific, sometimes singular facet of the history of American journalism.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The legendary band leader Sun Ra said he came from Saturn. Known on Earth for his inventive music and extravagant stage shows, he pioneered free-form improvisation in an ensemble setting with the devoted band he called the &#8220;Arkestra,&#8221; Sun Ra took jazz from the inner city to outer space, infusing traditional swing with far-out harmonies, rhythms, and sounds. Described as the father of Afrofuturism, Sun Ra created &#8220;space music&#8221; as a means of building a better future for American blacks here on earth.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0292726368/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Pure Solar World: Sun Ra and the Birth of Afrofuturism</a> (<a href="https://utpress.utexas.edu/books/youngquist-a-pure-solar-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Texas Press</a>, 2016) offers a spirited introduction to the life and works of this legendary but underappreciated musician, composer, and poet. The book explores and assesses Sun R&#8217;as wide-ranging creative output&#8211;music, public preaching, graphic design, film and stage performance, and poetry&#8211;and connects his diverse undertakings to the culture and politics of his times, including the space race, the rise of technocracy, the civil rights movement, and even space-age bachelor-pad music. By thoroughly examining the astro-black mythology that Sun Ra espoused, A Pure Solar World: Sun Ra and the Birth of Afrofuturism masterfully demonstrates that he offered both a holistic response to a planet desperately in need of new visions and vibrations and a new kind of political activism that used popular culture to advance social change. In a nation obsessed with space and confused about race, Sun Ra aimed not just at assimilation for the socially disfranchised but even more at a wholesale transformation of American society and a more creative, egalitarian world.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[From the moment he entered politics as the manager of John F. Kennedy&#8217;s 1952 Senate campaign, Robert Kennedy&#8217;s political career was subsumed into that of his older brother. With President Kennedy&#8217;s assassination in November 1963 his grief-stricken younger brother suddenly found himself unmoored politically. In<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1608199649/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Revolution of Robert Kennedy: From Power to Protest after JFK</a> (<a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/the-revolution-of-robert-kennedy-9781608199648/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomsbury Press</a>, 2017), <a href="https://www.johnrbohrer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Bohrer</a> describes how Robert Kennedy came into his own in the years that followed. Now bearing the weight of a nation&#8217;s expectations, Robert faced both the pressure to uphold his brother&#8217;s legacy and the hostility of the new president. With Lyndon Johnson forestalling any effort to make Robert his running mate in 1964, Kennedy focused his aspirations instead on the United States Senate, winning a seat in New York against a popular incumbent. As Bohrer demonstrates, once in the Senate Kennedy quickly emerged as a political leader in his own right, as he used his outsized prominence to address the issues that mattered most to him.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During the Civil War Father James Sheeran served as a Catholic chaplain for the 14th Louisiana Infantry. Between his various responsibilities Sheeran kept a journal in which he recounted his experiences with, and observations of, life in the Army of Northern Virginia. As editor of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0813228824/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Civil War Diary of Rev. James Sheeran, Chaplain, Confederate, Redemptorist</a> (Catholic University of America Press, 2016), Patrick J. Hayes has provided readers with the most complete edition yet of Sheeran&#8217;s manuscript, one that details the activities of a man of faith in a time of war. An immigrant from Ireland, Sheeran joined the Redemptorist congregation in the 1850s and was serving as a parish priest in New Orleans when the war began in 1861. As a military chaplain, Sheeran witnessed firsthand many of the key battles of the Civil War, from Second Manassas in 1862 to Cedar Creek in 1864, and his recorded observations provide a valuable record of those clashes. Yet Sheeran&#8217;s diaries also serve as a window into what life was like for soldiers and civilians during the conflict, as observed by a man whose commitment to the Confederate cause was matched only by his piety.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the capital of the African nation of Angola today stands a statue to Njinga, the 17th century queen of the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms. Its presence is a testament to her skills as a diplomat, warrior, and leader of her people, all of which she demonstrated over the course of a reign described by <a href="https://www.bu.edu/afam/faculty/linda-heywood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linda Heywood</a> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674971825/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Njinga of Angola: Africa&#8217;s Warrior Queen</a> (Harvard University Press, 2017). The daughter of the Ndongo king Mbande a Ngola, Njinga grew up in a west central Africa that was facing growing encroachment by Portugal, who were major customers in the regions slave trade. Seeking to extend their control, the Portuguese challenged Njinga&#8217;s succession to the throne in 1624, prompting a war that lasted for three decades. To persevere, Njinga had to navigate the complex politics of the region, gaining control of the Matamba kingdom and pursuing ties with both the Vatican and the Dutch to provide a counterweight to the Portuguese. The treaty signed with Portugal in 1656 was a testament to her success, allowing her to focus on establishing a legacy of an independent kingdom that she could pass on to her sister after her death.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Fueling his bohemian lifestyle and anti-authoritarian attitude with a steady diet of ice cream and whiskey, along with a healthy dose of insomnia, Warren Sturgis McCulloch is best known for his foundational contributions to cybernetics but led a career that spanned psychiatry, philosophy, neurophysiology, and engineering. <a href="https://www.uoguelph.ca/arts/history/people/tara-abraham" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara H. Abraham</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/026203509X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebel Genius: Warren S. McCulloch&#8217;s Transdisciplinary Life in Science</a> (MIT Press, 2016) is the first scholarly biography of this towering figure of twentieth century American science. Abrahams careful tracing of McCulloch&#8217;s broad disciplinary traverses is grounded in explication of heady theories and mathematical models of the brain. The growing historical scholarship on cybernetics rests on a curious threshold: its subject matter, rife with outsized personalities and uncannily forward-looking ideas, is ever poised to remain more ineluctably fascinating than scholarly analysis can render. Rather than attempting to beat the cyberneticians at their own game&#8211;self-consciously or not becoming participant observers in the reflexive system described by &#8220;second-order&#8221; cybernetics&#8211;this rich portrait offers pointed and entertaining insight into the role of style, sociability, and mentorship in twentieth century scientific life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As an African-American child growing up in the segregated pre-Civil Rights South, <a href="http://www.sarahbraceywhite.com/">Sarah Bracey White</a> pushed against the social conventions that warned her not to rock the boat, even before she was old enough to fully understand her urge to defy the status quo. In her candid and poignant memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933880384/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Primary Lessons</a> (CavanKerry Press, 2013), White recalls a childhood marked by equal measures of poverty and pride&#8211;formative years spent sorting through the &#8220;lessons&#8221; learned from a complicated relationship with her beloved, careworn mother and from a father&#8217;s absence engendered by racial injustice and compromised manhood.<br />
Although born in Sumter, South Carolina, Sarah spends much of her first five years in Philadelphia in the care of her bighearted Aunt Susie and her husband, Uncle Whitey. As her parents fourth daughter, she has been sent north to ease her family&#8217;s financial burden, freeing her mother to work as a schoolteacher. Young Sarah loves her life in Philadelphia, and is devastated when her mother comes to retrieve her and take her back to a home she has never known. There, she is shocked and confused to encounter strange signs that read &#8220;colored only&#8221; and to be told for the first time that black people must behave a certain way around white people and accept their lot as second class citizens.<br />
&#8220;The point of any successful memoir is to discover what the speaker learns on their journey,&#8221; writes Kevin Pilkington, author of Ready to Eat the Sky and The Unemployed Man Who Became a Tree, in his foreword to Primary Lessons. &#8220;[I]t is a trip worth taking when it teaches and enlightens and encourages me to revisit and solidify profound truths I already know to be true. Sarah Bracey Whites journey is a continuous struggle to find her way, a struggle I found both difficult and inspirational. Martin Luther King, Jr. said that &#8216;injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&#8217; Young Sarah becomes aware of this at an early age, realizing being born poor and black is not the measure of a persons value.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Readers follow von Frisch from his early intimate connection with a small Brazilian parakeet that lived with the family while von Frisch was a boy, to his work on the sensory powers of fish and bees, to his work on bee communication and beyond. Munz introduces us not just to von Frisch&#8217;s texts, lectures, and experiments, but also to his work making films and his struggles to live and work under Nazi power. Munz&#8217;s book is both compellingly argued and a pleasure to read!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/025302224X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Last Rabbi: Joseph Soloveitchik and Talmudic Tradition</a> (Indiana University Press, 2016), <a href="http://english.biu.ac.il/faculty/kolbrener-william" target="_blank">William Kolbrener</a>, professor of English at Bar Ilan University in Israel, explores the life and thought of Joseph Soloveitchik, the scion of the Brisk rabbinic dynasty, from both literary and psychoanalytic perspectives. The result is both a compelling critique of extant receptions of Soloveitchik&#8217;s thought and a nuanced exploration of the sources and struggles at the root of the Rav&#8217;s towering intellectual and halakhic achievements. The book will be of interest to students of rabbinic hermeneutics, modern Jewish thought, psychoanalysis, and the Western philosophical tradition &#8212; all intellectual realms in which Soloveitchik was well versed.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442268697/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Dr. Joyce Brothers: The Founding Mother of TV Psychology</a> (Rowman and Littlefield, 2016), <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/kathleen-collins-0" target="_blank">Kathleen Collins</a> presents an extensive history of the woman who is arguably the most famous television psychologist. Starting with Brothers&#8217; appearance as a boxing expert on the $64,000 Question in the 1950s, and bringing readers through her decades-long career in television and radio, Collins argues that Brothers created the personal approach to psychology that became the norm for television other popular media. Collins examines the different ways that Brothers created a career for herself for over 50 years, looking at her role as psychologist, as well as her roles as guest star, actor, and media celebrity. She looks at the ways Brothers used her savvy business sense to create a multilayered career that made vital contributions to psychology, television, and U.S. cultural history. Collins uses Brothers&#8217; personal papers and her published interviews as well as her own interviews with Brothers&#8217; daughter and colleagues to create a well-researched and informative exploration into this television icon.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Charles K. (CK) McClatchy was a towering figure in the making of Sacramento and the inland empire he liked to call Superior California. As editor of the Sacramento Bee from 1883 to 1936, McClatchy was both ardent booster and strident critic, a man whose voice helped shape Sacramento&#8217;s industrial landscape and to set its moral and political tone. In a new biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0826220681/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles McClatchy and the Golden Era of American Journalism</a> (University of Missouri Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/history/HistoryFacultyAvella.shtml">Steven M. Avella</a> explores McClatchy&#8217;s public role as an iconoclastic editor who sketched local battles in dramatic terms of good and evil. Avella also examines the contradictions within the private man and the dark impulses that drove him to bouts of vindictiveness and rancor. McClatchy promoted his beloved Sacramento with a distinctive blend of Progressive politics, but in his later years he suffered from an anachronistic world view that relegated him to the sidelines of American life. This biography, based on extensive primary sources, is a fully drawn portrait of a flawed hero who loved his home town and helped establish a media dynasty whose influence is still felt today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the rising stars in American politics during the 1930s was Paul Vories McNutt. As governor of Indiana, McNutt refashioned the state government to address its citizens needs during the Great Depression, and was seen by many of his contemporaries as a future president of the United States. Yet McNutt never attained this goal, and his political career ended barely a decade and a half after it began. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0253014689/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Paul V. McNutt and the Age of FDR</a> (Indiana University Press, 2015), <a href="http://www.salisbury.edu/history/faculty.html">Dean Kotlowski</a> recounts McNutt&#8217;s life and career, explaining both his many achievements and how his ultimate ambitions were frustrated. The son of a small-town Indiana lawyer, as a young man McNutt distinguished himself academically and socially, and after serving in the army during World War I he assumed leadership positions at both Indiana University and in the American Legion. As a Democrat, he won the governorship in the 1932 election, and over the course of his term he won plaudits for his effectiveness in the office. Yet afterward his ascent stalled, as his potential rivals steered him towards service as high commissioner in the Philippines in order to sideline him. McNutt returned in time to pursue the Democratic Party&#8217;s 1940 presidential nomination, but Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s decision to run for a third term ended both McNutt&#8217;s hopes for it and what proved his best chance to become president. Though McNutt continued to serve in key offices throughout World War II, these lower-profile posts led to his eclipse politically and his abandonment of politics soon after.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Caterina Corner lived a life that was composed of a mixture of adventure, power, and tragedy. The daughter of a Venetian patrician and merchant, she was married to the king of Cyprus while barely a teenager. Within two years of voyaging to her new home in 1472, she became a mother, a widow, and the ruler of Cyprus, over which she reigned until she was dethroned by her Venetian benefactors in 1489. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/030020972X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Daughter of Venice: Caterina Corner, Queen of Cyprus and Woman of the Renaissance</a> (Yale University Press, 2015), <a href="http://cola.siu.edu/history/faculty-and-staff/faculty/hurlburt.php" target="_blank">Holly Hurlburt</a> describes the life and artistic legacy of this remarkable woman. As she explains, much of our image of her is shaped by the portraits and other artwork of her, both from her reign and afterward. In combination with the extant documentary record, they reveal how Caterina maintained and projected her authority as queen in a tumultuous time while facing challenges from several Mediterranean powers. Ever after her removal to a community in northern Venice, she maintained her influence and dignity as the lady of Asolo, both as a noble landowner and as a Renaissance patron.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his acclaimed biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062198866/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Eye on the Struggle: Ethel Payne, the First Lady of the Black Press</a> (Amistad, Reprint Edition, 2017), <a href="http://jamesmcgrathmorris.com/" target="_blank">James McGrath Morris</a> explores the fascinating life of pioneering black female journalist Ethel Payne. Backed by exhaustive archival research, Morris traces Payne&#8217;s role in documenting the civil rights struggle during the decades following World War II, before her later impact as the first female African American radio and television commentator on a national network. The New York Times has described Eyes on the Struggle as an &#8220;an important and often absorbing new book,&#8221; while the Chicago Tribune has contended that Morris&#8217; beautifully written and carefully researched new book &#8220;gives Payne&#8217;s ground-breaking work the attention it deserves.&#8221;<br />
Morris&#8217; other books include Pulitzer: A Life in Politics, Print, and Power, which Booklist placed on its 2010 list of the ten best biographies, and The Rose Man of Sing Sing: A True Tale of Life, Murder, and Redemption in the Age of Yellow Journalism, which the Washington Post named as one of its Best Books of the Year. His most recent work is The Ambulance Drivers: Hemingway, Dos Passos, and a Friendship Made and Lost in War which will be published in April 2017 by Da Capo Press.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Henry and Emily Folger were linked together not just by their love for one another, but their shared passion for the works of William Shakespeare. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421411873/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Collecting Shakespeare: The Story of Henry and Emily Folger</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.stephenhgrant.com/">Stephen H. Grant</a> describes how the two of them devoted their lives to acquiring Shakespeare&#8217;s works and related artifacts and how that collection became the cornerstone of one of the great cultural institutions in the world today. Though his interest in Shakespeare developed during his time at Amherst College, Henry Folger chose a career in business and began working for Standard Oil while in law school. It was through his membership in a literary circle that he met Emily, a Vassar graduate who taught in Brooklyn. As husband and wife they spent their time combing through catalogues, traveling, and engaging in constant correspondence with booksellers and others in search of First Folios and other rare works of early modern English literature. While they were reticent about their collection during their lifetime, the two sought to memorialize their success with what became the Folger Shakespeare Library, a research institution funded by the fortune Henry built up over half a century and guided to realization after his death by Emily.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[John William McCormack served as Speaker of the House of Representatives throughout most of the 1960s, during which time he shepherded the legislation of Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s Great Society program through the chamber. As <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~polisci/?Page=GarrisonNelson.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garrison Nelson</a> demonstrates in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1628925167/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John William McCormack: A Political Biography </a>(Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), this was the culmination of a long political career that stretched back over a half-century to the impoverished South Boston neighborhood where McCormack was raised. There, in an environment where ethnic and class identities defined ones political prospects, McCormack covered up his father&#8217;s Scots Canadian heritage to establish his Irish Catholic bona fides. First elected to the House of Representatives in 1928, he was well positioned to benefit from the dramatic transformation in the fortunes of the Democratic Party during the Great Depression, becoming the House Majority Leader. As Nelson demonstrates, it was McCormack&#8217;s personal relationships which shaped his career, most notably those with Sam Rayburn, the legendary Speaker alongside whom McCormack would serve in the House leadership for over two decades, and John F. Kennedy, the scion of two Boston political families and a man who often found himself at odds with the longtime Congressman.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804136548/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Inkblots: Hermann Rorschach, His Iconic Test, and The Power of Seeing</a> (Crown, 2017), <a href="http://damionsearls.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damion Searls </a>presents the first biography of Hermann Rorschach and the history of the Rorschach Test. A story that is largely untold, Searls starts with the childhood of Rorschach and brings readers through his growth as a psychiatrist as he created an experiment to probe the mind using a set of ten inkblots. As a visual artist, Rorschach incorporated his ability to think about visuals and his belief that what is seen is more important than what we say. After his early death, Rorschach&#8217;s Test found its way to America being used by the military, to test job applicants, to evaluate defendants and parents in custody battles and people suffering from mental illness. In addition, it has been used throughout advertising and incorporated in Hollywood and popular culture. A tragic figure, and one of the most influential psychiatrists in the twentieth century, The Inkblots allows readers to better understand how Rorschach and his test impacted psychiatry and psychological testing. Searls&#8217; work is eloquently written and detailed, pulling in unpublished letters, diaries and interviews with family, friends and colleagues. Searls&#8217; well researched text presents insight into the ways that art and science have impacted modern psychology and popular culture.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During a life that stretched from the Progressive era to the 1960s, A. J. Muste dedicated himself to fighting against war and the exploitation of working Americans. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/081224639X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Gandhi: A. J. Muste and the History of Radicalism in the Twentieth Century</a> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014), <a href="http://nau.edu/cal/history/faculty-staff/danielson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leilah Danielson</a> describes the course of Muste&#8217;s career as a pacifist, labor organizer, and civil rights campaigner, explaining the development of his ideology within the context of his activism. An immigrant to America, Muste pursued a career as a Protestant minister until the pressures created by America&#8217;s entry into World War I forced him to resign from his pastorate. His work supporting striking textile workers in in Lawrence, Massachusetts heralded the start of a period of involvement in the labor movement, during which time he became a leading figure at Brookwood Labor College and attempted to establish a labor-based political party during the Great Depression. As another war approached in the late 1930s Muste returned to his roots as a Christian pacifist and spent the next three decades working on behalf of the civil rights and anti-nuclear movements before ending his years as a staunch opponent of America&#8217;s involvement in the war in Vietnam. As Danielson demonstrates, Muste&#8217;s ideas and example inspired generations of activists throughout the world, both in his time and in ours today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Though best remembered today for his brief tenure as the ninth president of the United States, William Henry Harrison&#8217;s most significant contribution to American history was his service as a general in the War of 1812. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421405466/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Henry Harrison and the Conquest of the Ohio Country: Frontier Fighting in the War of 1812</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.usni.org/author/david-curtis-skaggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Curtis Skaggs</a> recounts Harrison&#8217;s military career and the lessons he learned that brought him national acclaim. The son of a Virginia aristocrat, Harrison rejected a medical career in favor of service in the United States Army. While serving as an aide to General Anthony Wayne in the 1790s, he learned the challenges of campaigning in what was then the northwestern frontier of the United States. These lessons stood him in good stead later when, as governor of Indiana Territory, he faced the growing challenge of Tecumseh&#8217;s confederacy, the defeat of which became his claim to fame. Yet as Skaggs demonstrates it was his subsequent victory over British forces at the Battle of the Thames which was his greatest achievement, as it ensured that the territories that became Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan would return to American control at the end of the War of 1812.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Calamity Jane was a celebrity of the 19th century American West, yet the woman portrayed in the newspapers and dime novels was one very different from the actual person. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080614632X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Life and Legends of Calamity Jane</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2014), <a href="http://richardetulain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Etulain</a> sorts through over a century of fiction and half-truths to uncover who Calamity Jane was in real life. Born Martha Canary, she was orphaned at a young age and left to provide for her siblings. Working a variety of jobs, she came to Deadwood in 1876, where she soon received national press attention both for her unusual persona and her brief association with &#8220;Wild Bill&#8221; Hickok. Yet these accounts were usually more fabrication than fact, and often did not reflect the difficult circumstances of her life. Suffering from alcoholism, she lived an itinerant and unstable existence, one in which her drinking impeded her efforts to provide for herself and her daughter and led to her early death. Etulain&#8217;s biography gets to the truth of Calamity Jane&#8217;s life, as well as the development of her posthumous reputation in print, in movies, and on television.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/american-studies/people/profile/r-crockatt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Crockatt</a> is an Emeritus Professor in the School of American Studies at the University of East Anglia. His book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198785496/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein &amp; Twentieth-Century Politics: &#8216;A Salutary Moral Influence</a>&#8216; (Oxford University Press, 2016), is an intellectual biography of Einstein&#8217;s political thought. As one the most compelling figures of the twentieth century, Einstein first gained public attention for his scientific theories placing him on the world stage. Developing a broad network of liberal internationalists he had the opportunity to speak for and support some of the most critical political issues of his day. Crockatt follows him through his early days and his connections with men like Bertrand Russell, H.G. Wells and Albert Schweitzer that shaped his thought as a global public intellectual. From his position of professional influence and personal charm, he worked on behalf of pacifism, Zionism, world government, freedom, and against the arms race. Einstein&#8217;s positions emerged from deep moral conviction yet his thought remained complex, non-dogmatic and at times seemingly contradictory. Crockatt has captured the deep moral sensibility and agile political mind of a scientist who exercised &#8220;a salutary moral influence.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Many scholars of baseball and American sports have focused on Ty Cobb as an integral and controversial character in the history of baseball. However, scholars have ignored the ways in which the story of Ty Cobb intersects with ideas of turn-of-the-century masculinity and honor. Steve Tripp in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442251913/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ty Cobb, Baseball, and American Manhood</a> (Rowman and Littlefield, 2016) explores the ways in which Cobb proved to be an interesting case study in the role that manhood played in the lives of men that found themselves in a changing American landscape. Tripp argues that the men in Cobb&#8217;s life and the values they embodied&#8211;honor, personal autonomy, nerve, and will&#8211;played an integral role in Cobb&#8217;s formation of his own masculinity. Not only does Tripp focus on Cobb, but the people that granted him fame and disdain: the fans of turn-of-the-century baseball. <a href="https://www.gvsu.edu/history/steve-tripp-54.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Tripp </a>is currently Professor of History at Grand Valley State University.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte was a celebrity in 19th century America thanks in no small measure to her brief marriage to Napoleon Bonaparte&#8217;s youngest brother Jerome. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0996594434/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Woman of Two Worlds: Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte </a>(Maryland Historical Society, 2016), Alexandra Deutsch draws upon the documents and artifacts Elizabeth&#8217;s family donated to describe her life. The daughter of a wealthy American merchant, her charm and beauty captivated Jerome, who married her in 1803 only to leave her and her unborn two years later at the emperors insistence. Though the Bonapartes sought to distance themselves from Elizabeth, she spent the next several decades doggedly fighting to win acceptance of her son and his children as members of the Bonaparte line, all while building a fortune of her own. Deutsch details these efforts by using Elizabeth&#8217;s possessions to describe the various ways in which she associated herself with the Bonaparte family, an effort that was every bit as important to her as the ongoing legal struggle to confirm her son&#8217;s legitimacy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Tim Brady&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1101988150/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His Father&#8217;s Son: The Life of General Ted Roosevelt, Jr. </a>(NAL, 2017) is not just the biography of the eldest son and namesake of America&#8217;s 26th president, but an account of a life that was adventurous and consequential in its own right. Coming of age in the years in which his Theodore Roosevelt served as president, Ted at times struggled to measure up to the daunting example set by his dynamic father. While often emulating his father&#8217;s path, Ted nonetheless sought to be judged on his own achievements, and distinguished himself in both business and in command during the First World War. To many Ted was on his way to becoming the second Roosevelt to occupy the White House, yet his electoral career came to a premature end in 1924 with his loss to Al Smith in the race for the governorship of New York a loss which paved the way for his subsequent political eclipse by his distant cousin, Franklin. Yet as Brady demonstrates, the growing animosity between the two branches of the family did nothing to dim Ted&#8217;s commitment to serve his country in its hour of greatest need, and it was while in uniform as a United States Army general in France that his life came to its tragically early end.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The term historical fiction covers a wide range from what the mystery writer Josephine Tey once dubbed &#8220;history with conversation&#8221; to outright invention shading into fantasy. But behind every story set in the past lies the past itself, as re-created by scholars from the available evidence. This interview features <a href="http://www.helenrappaport.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helen Rappaport</a>, whose latest work reveals the historical background behind the Masterpiece Theater miniseries <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/programs/features/news/victoria-air-masterpiece-pbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victoria</a>, due to air in the United States this month. Rappaport served as historical consultant to the show.<br />
The Queen Victoria who gave her name to an age famous for a prudishness so extreme that even tables had limbs, not legs, is nowhere evident in Rappaport&#8217;s book, the television series, or the novel by Daisy Goodwin, also titled Victoria, that gave rise to the series. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062568892/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victoria: The Heart and Mind of a Young Queen</a> (<a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062568892/victoria-the-heart-and-mind-of-a-young-queen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harper Design</a>, 2017) explores in vivid, compelling prose the letters, diaries, and other documents associated with the reign of a strong-minded, passionate, eager, inexperienced girl who took the throne just after her eighteenth birthday. This Victoria loved to ride, resisted marriage, fought to separate herself from her mother, detested her mother&#8217;s close adviser, and became infatuated with her prime minister before transferring her affections to Prince Albert, who initially did not impress her. Wildly devoted to her husband, she bore nine children but hated being pregnant and regarded newborn infants as ugly. Even her name caused controversy: christened Alexandrina, she switched to Victoria on taking the throne, overriding critics who insisted that Elizabeth or Charlotte were more suitable appellations for a British monarch. By the time she died sixty-three years later, entire generations understood the word &#8220;queen&#8221;as synonymous with &#8220;Victoria.&#8221;<br />
Although the most powerful woman in the world, Victoria here makes some serious mistakes, as any eighteen-year-old thrust into the center of politics would. If she had no social media to record every misstep, she also had no publicity managers or image brokers to spin her rash remarks or misjudgments. As Daisy Goodwin notes in the foreword to this book, Victoria had to grow up in public, and she left a precious record of that journey in her own exquisite handwriting. But since this is the official companion volume to a television show, it also includes details about casting and costuming, as well as numerous photographs of the actors and background information about the times. It makes a perfect starting point for a discussion of history and historical fiction, their differences and similarities, and how to observe the requirements of one without violating the precepts of the other.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Clyde Warrior was a Ponca Indian who in the 1960s was one of the founders of the &#8220;Red Power&#8221; movement for the rights of Native Americans. While his name may not be as well-known as that of other civil rights leaders of that decade, as <a href="http://montananorthern.academia.edu/PaulMcKenzieJones" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul McKenzie-Jones </a>reveals in this biography<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806147059/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Clyde Warrior: Tradition, Community, and Red Power</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2015), he was as just as pivotal a figure as many such figures who are household names today. Growing up on his grandparents farm in Oklahoma, Warrior was immersed in Ponca culture and became renowned for his prowess in the Fancy Dance competitions in the postwar Southwest. In college he embraced student activism, and went from participation in Indian student groups to the establishment of the National Indian Youth Council in 1961. As an advocate of self-determination, he was soon at the forefront of the movement for greater Native American rights, even coining the phrase Red Power in 1966 to encapsulate his goals. As McKenzie-Jones demonstrates, Warriors premature death cut short his promising career but left a legacy that would be carried on by others in the decades that followed.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Artaud lived with his neck placed firmly in the noose.&#8221;<br /><br />
-Bauhaus*<br />
<a href="http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/history/faculty/shafer/" target="_blank">David Shafer&#8217;s</a> new biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1780235704/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Antonin Artaud</a> (Reaktion Books and the University of Chicago Press, 2016), situates the life of this enigmatic and fascinating figure in historical context. From his bourgeois family background, through a life that included a variety of physical and mental health challenges, drug use, and institutionalization, Shafer traces the ways that Artaud&#8217;s intellectual and artistic development was shaped by broader historical and political events and forces. An actor of stage and screen, a poet, and theatre director, Artaud emerges in these chapters as the embodiment of the French revolutionary tradition in the cultural realm. Shafer traces his subjects geographic movements from his Mediterranean origins to the streets of Paris, and on to other destinations, Mexico and Ireland among these. In addition to these sites, Artaud held in his imagination a number of other locales, including the physical and cultural landscapes of an East that informed his critique of Western society and its traditions.<br />
Throughout the book, Shafer takes Artaud on his own terms, avoiding judgments and hasty conclusions about the ideas, beliefs, and experiences of his protagonist. The result is an empathetic, yet still critical, biography of an icon of the world of performance. Readers not familiar with Artaud&#8217;s far-reaching influence across the domains of art, music, literature, theatre, and film up to the present will find much in these pages to justify his consideration as one of the most important cultural players of the last century.<br />
*After our interview, David shared the link to <a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/browse/article_detail/antonin_artaud_aural_assault//BLOG" target="_blank">Aural Assault</a>, a blog post on Artaud and music that he wrote for the Reaktion Books website. In it, he discusses the music he listened to while writing the biography, as well as the links between Artaud and musicians like Richard Hell and Patti Smith.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As the founder of Sinn Fin and a leading architect of Irish independence, Arthur Griffith ranks as one of the founding fathers of modern Ireland. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/178537009X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Griffith</a> (Merrion Press, 2015), Owen McGee offers a biography of the writer and patriot framed within the context of the Irish nationalist movement. The son of a Dublin printer, Griffith was active in nationalist politics at an early age. His own experience in publishing led Griffith to start his own review journals, which served as a platform for his ideas and which were read by many of the leading writers and activists in Ireland. The First World War and the Rising that followed brought Griffith&#8217;s vision of parliamentary abstention into the mainstream of Irish politics, with Griffith and the other Sinn Fin victors in the general election that followed the war refusing to take their seats in Parliament and instead forming their own representative body, the Dil ireann. A leader of the nascent Irish government, Griffith served in a number of key positions and was the chairman of the Irish delegation that negotiated the controversial Anglo-Irish Treaty a treaty that partitioned the island ad plunged the new nation into a civil war that Griffith&#8217;s untimely death left for others to resolve.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How should we understand the interwar years in Britain? In<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022613315X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Prince of Tricksters: The Incredible True Story of Netley Lucas, Gentleman Crook</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016) <a href="https://twitter.com/TricksterPrince">Matt Houlbrook</a>, <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/history/houlbrook-matt.aspx">Professor of Cultural History at the University of Birmingham</a>,tells the fascinating and complex story of Netley Lucas, a character whose fragmented and complex story offers clues to the social changes of the period. Netley&#8217;s career as confidence trickster, fraudulent journalist and editor, and creator of counterfeit royal biographies, forms the basis of an engagement with anxieties over class boundaries, the reassertion of social norms, and the nature of the historical source. The book is resplendent with a complex cast of characters and offers a rich portrait of the period. Houlbrook raises the question of how to tell the story of the trickster, if it is possible to capture a life of half-truths and duplicity, and<a href="https://tricksterprince.wordpress.com"> the struggle of historical practice</a>, ultimately causing us to question the possibility of history itself. The book is a fascinating tale, as well as being of interest across the humanities and to the general reader.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Born just five years after the abolition of slavery, W. E. B. Du Bois died the night before Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his I Have a Dream speech at the March on Washington in 1963. In the many decades between, W. E. B. Du Bois contributed as much to the political and social advancement of African Americans as any other figure in history.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745335055/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W. E. B. Du Bois: Revolutionary Across the Color Line</a> (Pluto Press, 2016) offers an accessible and brief introduction to the life and times of W. E. B. Du Bois. It takes in his many achievements, such as being the first black man to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University and co-founding the NAACP, and sets them alongside the seismic political changes of the twentieth century many of which Du Bois weighed in on, including anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles across Asia and Africa.<br />
The author reveals a Du Bois who was focused not just on the immediate question of African American rights, but also took up the question of socialism, the rise of communism, and the complicated interrelationship of capitalism, poverty, and racism. The picture that emerges here is of a powerfully original thinker, fiercely engaged with the political, economic, and social questions of his day never letting up in his struggle to change the world for the better.<br />
<a href="https://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/directory/?p=Bill_Mullen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Bill V. Mullen</a> is a professor of American Studies at Purdue University, and teaches courses in African American Literature and Culture, American Studies, Working-Class Literature, Cultural Studies, and Postcolonial Literature. His previous written works include Afro-Orientalism, Popular Fronts: Chicago and African American Cultural Politics 1935-1946 and Un-American: W.E.B. Du Bois and the Century of World Revolution. In addition to his current tenure at Purdue University, Dr. Mullen also has been a Fulbright lecturer at Wuhan University in the Peoples Republic of China.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The remarkable story of Henry Ossian Flipper, a young man born into slavery on the eve of the Civil War, and his struggle for recognition left its mark on our nations history. Through extensive research of military documents, court records, appeals, and from Flippers personal journals and published papers, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1681790068/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Henry Ossian Flipper: West Point&#8217;s First Black Graduate</a> (<a href="http://www.eakinpress.com/henry-ossian-flipper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Horse Press</a>, 2015) captures the sum and substance of a nation torn apart by political ambitions and extreme prejudices and reveals the uncertainty of acceptance and intolerance of blacks in America following Lincoln&#8217;s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. In 1878, Flipper seemed destined for a long military career. Four years later, he was on trial at Fort Davis, Texas, for embezzlement of government funds and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman. But his journey through the West did not end in West Texas, it was only the beginning. Before Flipper&#8217;s life was over his adventures would take him through Mexico, South America, and Arizona. It was on that journey that he found fame and redemption.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Although defined throughout his professional career as a development economist, Albert O. Hirschman&#8217;s intellectual scope defied classification. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691163499/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldly Philosopher: The Odyssey of Albert O. Hirschman</a> (Princeton University Press, 2013) <a href="https://history.princeton.edu/people/jeremy-adelman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Adelman</a> describes the course of a restless thinker whose life intersected with some of the most important events and developments of the twentieth century. Born to a family of assimilated Jews, Hirschman grew up in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. After the Nazi regime came to power Hirschman began an itinerant existence, gaining an education in economics from universities in three different countries. A passionate anti-fascist, he fought for the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War and France in the Second World War. With the fall of France in 1940 he helped many of Europe&#8217;s leading artists and intellectuals escape from Nazi rule before emigrating to the United States himself. After wartime service in the OSS, Hirschman worked in the U.S. government on the postwar reconstruction of the European economy before moving to Colombia to serve as an advisor to the government there. His experiences in Latin America proved key to his emergence as a pioneer in the new field of development economics, which led to a succession of prestigious academic appointments. Yet as Adelman shows his readers, Hirschman&#8217;s interests were never confined to any one discipline, and his wide-ranging investigations led to works which often transcended disciplinary boundaries in the process of contributing to the intellectual discourse.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During the Second World War millions of Britons tuned in nightly to hear the broadcasts of Lord Haw-Haw coming from Nazi Germany. Though the label was broadly applied to a number of English-speaking broadcasters, it was most famously associated with William Joyce. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138888869/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Searching for Lord Haw-Haw: The Political Lives of William Joyce</a> (Routledge, 2016), <a href="http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/history/staff/colin-holmes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colin Holmes</a> provides a study of Joyce&#8217;s life that unravels many of the mysteries and misconceptions surrounding it. He chronicles Joyce&#8217;s early years in Ireland, where his work as an informer and his family&#8217;s association with the British during the War of Independence led to his relocation to London after the Irish won their independence. There he quickly found a home in the embryonic Fascist movement, in which became a leading figure. His clashes with Oswald Mosley in the mid-1930s brought about Joyce&#8217;s purge from the British Union of Fascists in 1937 and the formation of his own National Socialist League. Yet it was Joyce&#8217;s relocation to Germany on the eve of war in 1939 that won him the attention he long craved, as he quickly established himself as the Nazi&#8217;s leading English-language propagandist. As Holmes shows, however, this fame came at a price, as Joyce&#8217;s efforts on behalf of Germany led after the end of the war to his arrest and execution for treason the last person in British history to face such an ignominious end.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Admiring books that appeal to our hearts and souls, rather often we want to know more about the writers who create them. If a book is a dialogical and communal entity&#8211;as readers we also participate in interpreting what we read, adding to and/or subtracting from the meanings of, so to speak, &#8220;original&#8221; texts and sharing our ideas with others&#8211;a portrait of the writer takes the audience to a somewhat different realm. Who creates writers&#8217; portraits? What sides of writers&#8217; lives get exposed, and which ones remain silenced, hushed-hushed, discreet? Who decides what portrait should be (or even must be) produced? And for what purpose? Readers rather often want to know more about people who wrote stories with which they fell in love; stories that they would like to share with their loved ones; stories that inspire them or, although it may sound cliched, change the way they look at life.<br />
Biographies are one of the sources to receive at least some access to the lives of others. But what is a biography? The answer may seem to be rather obvious: it is a persons story. Giving it a second thought, the obviousness of the answer gets blurry. If a person does not share his/her story, how is it reconstructed? If they are willing to share their lives with the public, what fragments are included into a personal narrative, and which ones remain secrets and mysteries? How are the lives, which happened to revolve around the one that develops into a book, managed? How does a diversity of pieces connect and combine? And what kind of a story emerges in the end: a &#8220;true&#8221;story, a &#8220;fictionalized story,&#8221; or both?<br />
A well-accomplished biographer, <a href="http://www.wm.edu/as/english/facultystaff/emeritus/donaldson_s.php" target="_blank">Dr. Scott Donaldson</a> shares his experience and his vision of biography as a genre in his recent publication, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0271065281/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Impossible Craft: Literary Biography</a> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2015). Arising at the boundary of a personal story and research exploration, The Impossible Craft includes chapters that provides insights into Scott Donaldson&#8217;s career, his journey to his craft suggesting valuable tips for those who may decide to pursue the same path. In &#8220;Topics in Literary Biography,&#8221; the author comments on those items that seem to be vital for completing a reliable biography: &#8220;Fact and Fiction; Writers as Subjects;&#8221; &#8220;Ethical Issues;&#8221; &#8220;Source: Letters;&#8221; &#8220;Sources: Interviews.&#8221; As Dr. Donaldson narrates his cases, it becomes rather prominent that it is hardly possible to speak about either an ideal biographer, &#8220;an ideal biography,&#8221; or &#8220;an ideal recipe&#8221; for writing a biography. While the notion of a good biography remains blurred, it is worthwhile looking into reasons for choosing a life that one would like to reconstruct and narrate: being honest with the subjects, audiences, and ones own self can guide through complexities that a task of collecting a life story out of multiple fragments may involve.<br />
A particularly intriguing part of The Impossible Craft is Scott Donaldson&#8217;s account of cases that this way or another change his perceptions and understandings of his profession: &#8220;Writing the Cheever,&#8221; &#8220;The Lawsuit,&#8221; &#8220;A Dual Biography of Fitz and Hem,&#8221; etc. In the Cheever section, for example, Dr. Donaldson provides some self-analysis: what has been done and what could have been differently. Again, aspiring biographers will find these parts very helpful. This book also bears a touching moment that emerges out of Dr. Donaldson&#8217;s reflections concerning his cases, his path, and the lives he happened to enter.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.michellemarkel.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Markel</a>, an award-winning author and former journalist who has written for The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, talks about books she&#8217;s written about two strong and brave women Clara Lemlich and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061804428/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Brave Girl: Clara and the Shirtwaist Makers Strike of 1909 </a>(Balzer + Bray, 2013), is illustrated by Caldecott Honor Artist Melissa Sweet and tells the story of Clara Lemlich, a young Ukrainian immigrant who led the largest strike of women workers in U.S. history. The book follows the plight of immigrants in America in the early 1900s, tackling topics like activism and the U.S. garment industry, and includes an extensive bibliography and authors notes about the garment industry at that time.<br />
Markel&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hillary-Rodham-Clinton-Some-Girls/dp/0062381229" target="_blank">Hillary Rodham Clinton: Some Girls Are Born to Lead </a>(Balzer + Bray, 2016), is about the woman we&#8217;ve all come to know and who, like Clara Lemlich sixty years earlier, has refused to accept the status quo of women in society and in the workplace.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://twitter.com/thedanielmoran" target="_blank">Daniel Moran&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0820349542/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Creating Flannery O&#8217;Connor: Her Critics, Her Publishers, Her Readers</a> (University of Georgia Press, 2016) provides a compelling investigation of how O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s initial reputation of a Southern female writer over the years evolved into her status of great American writer. The subtitle of the book&#8211;Her Critics, Her Publishers, Her Readers&#8211;hints at a variety of details contributing to a literary multilayered portrait. In his research, Dr. Moran considers a number of critical reviews, readers reactions, and publishers commercial decisions while following the trajectory of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s reputation. In the introduction, Dr. Moran notes that his book is &#8220;less a work of literary criticism than of a book history and cultural analysis&#8221; (9). His research invites a discussion of how the perception of literary texts is (or can be) shaped through conversations about them. Creating Flannery O&#8217;Connor draws on the theory of &#8220;rules of notice&#8221;&#8211;readers are supplied with keys to read and understand literary works and instigates a number of questions, which Dr. Moran addresses while de-constructing O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s portrait. Who identifies&#8221; rules of notice?&#8221; How, if at all, do they change? What do they inform about texts and their authors?<br />
If the initial reputation of O&#8217;Connor was primarily shaped by critical reviews, as years and decades elapsed since the publication of her early writings the environment that surrounds, absorbs, and modifies O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s works has, undoubtedly, significantly changed. To his survey of reputation production media, Dr. Moran adds the film industry and online resources: each domain presents O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s works from a different perspective. Through the de-construction of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s literary portrait that has been created over decades through a number of venues, Dr. Moran re-creates a new version: elusive, fluid, and changing.<br />
Daniel Moran teaches history at Monmouth University; he has taught English at Rutgers University.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As Labour Party leader, member of Winston Churchill&#8217;s governing coalition during the Second World War, and prime minister of the epochal postwar government that established the welfare state, Clement Attlee played a decisive role in the history of modern Britain. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190203404/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clement Attlee: The Man Who Made Modern Britain</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017; published in the UK as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Clem-Biography-John-Bew-ebook/dp/B013UV9E4S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizen Clem</a>), <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/people/professors/bew.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Bew</a> recounts the life and career of this modest yet deeply patriotic individual who dedicated his life to improving the condition of his fellow Britons. The son of a successful lawyer, Attlee enjoyed a comfortable upbringing until a trip to London&#8217;s East End exposed him to the degree of poverty in which many Britons lived. Dedicating himself to social work, he lived in the London slums until the outbreak of war in 1914 led him to volunteer for service. After the war he was elected to the House of Commons, where he often was overshadowed by the more dynamic personalities among his colleagues. Despite this, he weathered the tumult created by the fracturing of the Labour Party in 1931 and, as one of his party&#8217;s few remaining leaders in Parliament, he was quickly catapulted into the top post. As Bew demonstrates, this was not just a matter of luck but a reflection of political skills that his opponents frequently underestimated and which made it possible for him to lead so successfully both a cabinet of ambitious rivals and a nation recovering from the most debilitating war in its history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

She discusses Princess Diana&#8217;s struggle with eating disorder and severe loneliness; the impact of Frank Lloyd Wrights narcissism on his architectural masterpieces and personal relationships; and Andy Warhol&#8217;s penchant for holding onto and storing decades&#8217; worth of day-to-day objects. In our interview, Kalb talks about her keen interest in these people and their stories, and we discuss the way such stories humanize these idealized figures and universalize the human quest for mental and emotional well-being.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Sister Mary Corita, IHM (1918-1986), was a beloved artist and teacher whose role as the rebel nun continues to inspire contemporary audiences. Corita joined the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1936 when she was just eighteen years old, and soon after became an initially reluctant Art teacher at Immaculate Heart College. Corita remained part of the community on Franklin and Western Avenues in Hollywood until 1968 when Los Angeles archbishop Cardinal James Francis McIntyre, and other conservatives, targeted the orders reformist ways. Corita&#8217;s Pop Art styled prints celebrating the presence of God in the most ordinary of everyday subjects (Mary is the juiciest tomato of all) drew the ire of McIntyre in particular. At age fifty, she took one of many unconventional steps and left the order to start life anew as an independent woman.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1626400202/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Corita Kent: Art and Soul: The Biography </a> (Angel City Press, 2015), <a href="http://aprildammann.com/author.php" target="_blank">April Dammann</a> traces Corita&#8217;s path as an artist and religious woman who participated in the heady scene of the Los Angeles art world in the 1960s while engaging her own devout spirituality at the same time. Coritas journey into printmaking took her beyond the confines of the college to the world of the most famous artists and designers in Los Angeles including Charles Eames, John Cage, Edward Kienholz, and Tony Duquette. She interacted with Henry Miller, Anais Nin, and other members of Los Angeles literary avant-garde. Clad in her nuns habit, Corita was more than a picturesque observer of the scene, however. Her highly refined silkscreens combining word and image with meticulously placed colors transformed the medium. She culled subject matter from the ideas of thinkers and social commentators ranging from Goethe to Isaiah, to John Lennon, Paul McCartney, and radical priest and soul mate Daniel Berrigen. Corita&#8217;s students, many of whose voices color Dammann&#8217;s carefully researched book, were beneficiaries of Corita&#8217;s aesthetic and intellectual explorations. As we reconsider the life of Corita Kent, we are confronted, in the quiet yet powerful manner of the artist herself, with a woman whose contributions to the radical forms of the 1960s are immense.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.valdosta.edu/about/directory/profile/taiello" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Aiello</a> is associate professor of history and African American studies at Valdosta State University. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1440843570/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Battle for the Souls of Black Folk: W.E.B. Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and the Debate that Shaped the Course of Civil Rights</a> (ABC-CLIO, 2016) Aiello focuses on the conversation between Washington and Du Bois in order to fully examine its contours. The book serves as both a document reader and an authored text that enables readers to perceive how the back and forth between these two individuals produced a cacophony of ideas that made it anything but a bipolar debate, even though their expressed differences would ultimately shape the two dominant strains of activist strategy. The numerous chapters on specific topics and historical events follow a preface that presents an overview of both the conflict and its historiographical treatment; evaluates the legacies of both Washington and Du Bois, emphasizing the trajectories of their theories beyond 1915; and provides an explanation of the unique structure of the work.<br />
The debate between W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington on how to further social and economic progress for African Americans lasted 20 years, from 1895 to Washington&#8217;s death in 1915. Their ongoing conversation evolved over time, becoming fiercer and more personal as the years progressed. But despite its complexities and steadily accumulating bitterness, it was still, at its heart, a conversation and impassioned contest at the turn of the century to capture the souls of black folk. In addition to this work, Aiello is also the author of Jim Crow&#8217;s Last Stand: Nonunanimous Criminal Jury Verdicts In Louisiana; Model Airplanes Are Decadent and Depraved: The Glue-Sniffing Epidemic of the 1960s; and The Kings of Casino Park: Black Baseball in the Lost Season of 1932, among several others.<br />

In this interview, with the author, psychologist, and historian, <a href="http://www.gailhornstein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gail Hornstein</a>, we trace not only Fromm Reichmann&#8217;s many accomplishments, but also the history of Chestnut Lodge where she worked for many years, her relationships with Erich Fromm and Harold Searles, as well as the cultural impact of the book written by her patient Joanne Greenberg,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Never-Promised-You-Rose-Garden/dp/0312943598" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> I Never Promised You A Rose Garden</a>. To Redeem One Person Is to Redeem the World is essential reading for anyone interested not only in the history of American psychoanalysis, but also psychoanalysis in general.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.history.qmul.ac.uk/staff/profile/4513-professor-richard-bourke" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Bourke,</a> Professor in the History of Political Thought in the School of History at Queen Mary University of London, began developing his history of Edmund Burke&#8217;s political thought in 1991. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691145113/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke</a> (Princeton University Press, 2015) uses Burke as a window into the eighteenth-century articulations of British imperial power, exploring the way that Burke approached relations between Britain, Ireland, America, India, and France. Beginning with Burke&#8217;s boyhood in Ireland, and closing with the challenge of grappling with Burke&#8217;s ongoing legacy, this beautifully written book displays Professor Bourke&#8217;s long study, attention to detail, and gift for trenchant observation. Our conversation ranged over subjects as familiar today as they were in the 1700s, including Burke&#8217;s understanding of representative politics as a means of resolving conflicts present in the public at large, struggles between state and corporate power, and the warrant for popular revolution.<br />
<br />
&#8220;A career doesn&#8217;t have the coherence we impose upon it belatedly, but there exist preoccupations that recur and drive our action.&#8221;<br />

As <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/keyword/Marc%20Raboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Raboy</a> demonstrates in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019931358X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marconi: The Man Who Networked the World</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), it was he who pioneered the concept of wireless global communications. As a teenager he was fascinated by the recent discovery of radio waves, and by the time he was in his early twenties he had developed an apparatus that used these waves to transmit and receive messages. Traveling to London, he demonstrated a gift for publicity as he established himself as a technological pioneer in an age of rapidly emerging wonders. Thanks to his unassailable patents, Marconi soon created a global communications empire, one that made his name synonymous with radio and was so dominant that it brought the nations of the world together in an unprecedented international agreement to regulate the field of wireless telegraphy. Raboy recounts Marconi&#8217;s roving life as a celebrated figure, the development of his multinational business concerns, and his later relationship with the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and the shadow it cast over his posthumous reputation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Cates, From Belleau Wood to Victory in the Great War</a> (NAL, 2016), journalist and author<a href="http://us.macmillan.com/author/jamescarlnelson#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> James Carl Nelson</a> recounts Cates&#8217; early life and service in the war. Cates was studying to take the Tennessee bar when the United States joined the war in April 1917, an event which led Cates to set aside his studies and answer the call to service. After training in the rapidly-expanding Marine Corps, Cates was sent to France in January 1918, and within a few short months he found himself at the heart of combat at the battle of Belleau Wood. Despite being in the thick fighting, Clifton escaped serious injury, and with his unit he participated in the Soissons offensive later that summer. Nelson&#8217;s book offers a look at the war Cates fought against the Germans, one in which he demonstrated his natural leadership skills and won some of the highest honors our nation could bestow.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The transmission of a religion closely connected to a particular culture into a very different religious and cultural environment is a difficult act of translation in which a balance must be struck between remaining true to doctrine while understanding and accommodating cultural difference. Members of the Society of Jesus were engaged in a series of such projects in Asia in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This already difficult task was made more complex by the need to maintain unity and discipline among individual Jesuits when travel was dangerous and time consuming and letters might take years to reach their destinations. In his masterful book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674416686/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Visitor: Andre Palmeiro and the Jesuits in Asia</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014), <a href="http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/liam-brockey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liam Brockey</a> explores these issues through a study of the life of Andre Palmeiro, who traveled throughout Asia settling disputes over complex questions of belief, practice, and ritual. This informative work is not only a biography, as Brockey skillfully uses the career of Palmeiro to complicate the story of the Jesuits in Asia, for instance, showing that national origin was not the main factor determining how much or how little individual Jesuits approved of an &#8220;accomodationist&#8221; approach. This book is highly recommended, and scholars, graduate students, and those interested in issues of both mission history and the problem of translation will find it well worth reading.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In the early 1960s, in the segregated South, a white teenager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Trumpauer_Mulholland" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joan Trumpauer Mulholland</a>, made a conscientious decision to join the Civil Rights struggle. In doing so she put her life at risk, but given her family history (the first relative to come to America did so as an indentured servant in the 1600s; her grandmother was a suffragette) she could not sit idly by as blacks were treated like second-class citizens. She organized non-violent sit-ins, attended a predominately black college, and participated in protests including the March on Washington and the Selma to Montgomery March. She was arrested and held on death row; she was spit on, dragged off her stool and threatened with violence at a Woolworths lunch counter sit-in, yet she never relented. Now readers of all ages can learn more about this extraordinary woman in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/162972176X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">She Stood for Freedom: The Untold Story of a Civil Rights Hero, Joan Trumpauer Mulholland </a>(Shadow Mountain, 2016). The picture book is for ages 4 to 8; the illustrated biography is for ages 8 and older and includes primary source photographs and documents from the period. She Stood for Freedom has been nominated for the 2017 Amelia Bloomer Award, part of the American Library Association&#8217;s Task Force on Social Responsibility recognizing the best feminist books for young readers that &#8220;affirm positive roles for girls and women.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The story of the martyrdom of Husayn, the prophet Muhammad&#8217;s grandson, is recounted annually around the world. More broadly, the communal retelling of the lives of Shia imams has played an important part in shaping Shia identity and practice. <a href="https://www.centre.edu/directory/name/matthew-pierce/">Matthew Pierce</a>, Assistant Professor of Religion at Centre College, examines the early canonization of these life stories in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674737075/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twelve Infallible Men: The Imams and the Making of Shiism</a> (Harvard University Press, 2016). Pierce carefully conceptualizes the relationship between history, author, text, and audience through an examination of several collective biographies of the twelve imams from the 10th-12th centuries. From this sub-genre several themes arise in the presentation of the imams, their families, and their actions. Martyrdom is central to the retellings not only of Husayn, but of all the imams. The imams&#8217; death are remembered through images of suffering and mourning but structured in ways that provide solace for the audience. The collective biographies also offer representations of the imams&#8217; bodily performance and communicate idealized forms of masculinity. Accounts of women in the biographies also help in establishing gender norms for the audience. In our conversation we discussed the social role of biography, collective memory, medieval Sunni and Shia identities, gendered bodies, birth narratives, devotional practices, imam Ali&#8217;s primordial existence, martyrdom, and the narrative relationships between the imams.<br />

In the nineteenth century, when women were denied the vote, the self-made Victoria Woodhull, a political and religious outsider, ran on a platform of change and reform. In the 1940s, the pragmatic Republican Margaret Chase Smith entered politics as the result of the &#8220;widow&#8217;s mandate.&#8221; She stayed in Congress for over two decades and ran for president in 1964. The Democrat Shirley Chisholm took on the double jeopardy of running as the first black woman to seek the presidency in 1972. Her grassroots base included black community activists and feminists. All three women faced structural obstacles rather than lack of grit. Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential run in 2008 would again challenge the American resistance to breaking the highest glass ceiling and demonstrated how much and how little the prospects for a woman president had changed.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When Abraham Lincoln wrote that the better part of one&#8217;s life consists of his friendships, it is likely that he had in mind his friendship with Joshua Speed. Starting as roommates in Springfield, the two formed an extraordinarily close attachment, one that provided both men with considerable support at an important point in their respective lives. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231171323/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Friend Forever, A. Lincoln: The Enduring Friendship of Abraham Lincoln and Joshua Speed</a> (Columbia University Press, 2016), historian and psychoanalyst <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/charles-strozier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Strozier</a> applies the tools of both of his disciplines to exploring the bond between the two of them. In many ways the two were a study in contrasts, with Speed the more outgoing and polished of the two. Yet the younger Speed idolized the gangling lawyer and politician, and his friendship provided Lincoln with succor through depression and emotional turmoil. It was a favor Lincoln returned as well, and though the two became less close with Speed&#8217;s return to Kentucky in 1842, their enduring friendship led Speed to play a key role in Lincoln&#8217;s effort to preserve the union during the Civil War.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.c-span.org/person/?carolbooker" target="_blank">Carol McCabe Booker</a> is a Washington, D.C. attorney and former journalist. In the 1960s and 70s, she covered civil rights for the Voice of America, freelanced articles for The Washington Post, Readers Digest, Ebony, Jet, and Black Stars, and reported from Africa, including the Nigerian warfront, for Westinghouse Broadcasting stations. After retiring in 2008, she helped her husband, journalist Simeon Booker, write Shocking the Conscience: A Reporter&#8217;s Account of the Civil Rights Movement, which received widespread critical acclaim following its publication by the University Press of Mississippi.<br />
After Simeon and trailblazing reporter Alice Dunnigan were inducted into the black journalists Hall of Fame in 2013, Carol tracked down Dunnigan&#8217;s out-of-print autobiography to recover her fascinating story for a modern audience. The daughter of a sharecropper born in rural Kentucky, Dunnigan went on to become the first African American female reporter accredited by the White House, the Supreme Court, and the Senate, and fashioned an illustrious career in journalism and politics in the nation&#8217;s capital. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0820347981/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Alone Atop The Hill: The Autobiography of Alice Dunnigan, Pioneer of the National Black Press</a> (University of Georgia Press, 2015) is an updated, annotated edition of a classic yet forgotten memoir which illustrates how Dunnigan overcame race and gender barriers to break into the highest echelons of the national press.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Before the war, before the novels, before the four marriages and the safaris, the plane crashes and the bullfighting fascination, Ernest Hemingway was simply a young boy growing up in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Author <a href="http://robelder.com/" target="_blank">Robert K. Elder</a> lives in Oak Park, and for the colorful and interesting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1606352733/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hidden Hemingway: Inside the Ernest Hemingway Archives of Oak Park</a> (Kent State University Press, 2016), he and his co-authors Aaron Vetch and <a href="https://www.hemingwaysociety.org/mark-cirino" target="_blank">Mark Cirino</a> dug into multiple locations of the Hemingway archives. The legendary author&#8217;s life was as big as his fiction, and Elder and the documents preserved in the writer&#8217;s hometown help tell his story. Garrison Keillor said of the book, &#8220;Ernest Hemingway was the genuine literary giant of my youth: we groundlings studied him closely, we imitated and then we parodied him, we admired the fine figure he cut and envied his celebrity, and now fifty years later, it&#8217;s a privilege to look through his closet and read his stuff and discover him as a mortal man.&#8221; From ancestral documents and photos to Hemingway&#8217;s early prose, love letters, yearbook pages and more, a thorough picture of the writer emerges.<br />
Elder and podcast host Gael Fashingbauer Cooper discuss the most enlightening, surprising and shocking archival discoveries, as well as how Hemingway&#8217;s most famous dig at his hometown was probably never said by him at all.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What exactly is ADHD, and is it time to update our ideas about it? In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1504345835/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Your Innovator Brain: The Truth About ADHD</a> (Balboa Press, 2016), <a href="http://liveadhdfree.com/about-live-adhd-free/" target="_blank">Carol Gignoux</a> turns our ideas about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder on their head and introduces a strengths-based rather than deficits-based perspective on this brain type.<br />
In her forty-plus years coaching individuals with ADHD, Gignoux has witnessed how ADHD stigma stymies these individuals&#8217; creativity and self-esteem. They often adopt views of themselves predominated by what they can&#8217;t do rather than what they can. But these &#8220;innovators,&#8221; as she calls them, have unique capacities for creative problem-solving and productive risk-taking that others often envy. Look no further than Steve Jobs, Pablo Picasso, and Jonas Salk&#8211;innovators whose unique brain type helped them make extraordinary contributions to modern society. To make best use of their gifts, innovators need help with their very real limitations and greater understanding and appreciation for their assets. As she explains in our interview, Gignoux has made it her mission to help innovators find such understanding and support. In her book, she advances a paradigm shift in our conceptions of ADHD and outlines specific strategies for dealing with day-to-day challenges. This celebratory and useful first book from a decades-long advocate is a long-awaited update to our long-standing ideas about these unique individuals.<br />
I spoke with Gignoux about her book and her coaching experiences with individuals and their loved ones. I hope you enjoy the interview.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Among the achievements of Irish medicine in the twentieth century was ending the persistent epidemic of tuberculosis throughout the island, and one of the central figures in that effort was Dorothy Stopford Price. In her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0716532379/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dorothy Stopford Price: Rebel Doctor</a> (Irish Academic Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.ucd.ie/history/chomi/people/postdocs/anne-maclellan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anne Mac Lellan</a> provides readers with an account of the life of a pioneering MD and medical researcher. The daughter of an Anglo-Irish family, she trained as a doctor while Ireland participated in a world war and fought for its independence. As a member of Cumann na mBan, she provided medical care for members of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence against the British. Following the war, she became a pediatrician, in which capacity she developed her interest in the tuberculosis vaccine BCG then being introduced in Europe. As Dr. Mac Lellan demonstrates, Price&#8217;s tireless championing of tuberculosis vaccination in the 1930s and 1940s played a key role in winning acceptance for both the vaccine and the nationwide campaign that ended the scourge of the disease in Ireland.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Song Chinese emperor Huizong (r. 1100-1126 CE) has long been regarded as a failure due to his dynasty&#8217;s defeat in their war against the Jurchens. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674725255/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emperor Huizong</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014), however, <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/patricia-ebrey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patricia Buckley Ebrey</a> offers a more nuanced interpretation of his life and reign. Ebrey provides readers with a portrait of Huizong as a devout Daoist who devoted considerable attention to artistic interests. Focusing on Huizong&#8217;s efforts as an artist and collector, Ebrey presents him as an emperor of noteworthy cultural significance, one who not only was one of the leading calligraphers of his age but who made notable contributions to painting and poetry as well. Ebrey also examines Huizong&#8217;s role as a ruler, analyzing his relationships with his officials and how those relationships shaped the policies of his government. What emerges from her pages is the story of an emperor who, by favoring aesthetic concerns over administrative matters, made errors in judgment that in the end brought about his abdication and captivity.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Though not a household name today, Philip Pendleton Barbour was a leading political and judicial figure in antebellum America. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0817319069/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philip Pendleton Barbour in Jacksonian America: An Old Republican in King Andrew&#8217;s Court</a> (U. of Alabama Press, 2016), <a href="http://uwf.edu/cassh/departments/history/our-faculty/faculty--staff/dr-william-belko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William S. Belko</a> uses his career as an example of the political transformations of the second generation of American politicians. Born the year that America attained its independence, Barbour entered politics as a Jeffersonian Republican, championing the principles articulated by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison in the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions. Though out of step with the economic nationalism that predominated in the aftermath of the War of 1812, Barbour found an ally for his cause of a limited federal government in Andrew Jackson, and by the end of the 1820s he became a leader in the fight against the Bank of the United States. Though Jackson sought twice to appoint him as his attorney general, Barbour preferred a position on the federal bench, and was ultimately nominated to the Supreme Court in 1835. As Belko shows, Barbour&#8217;s service on the Court contributed to the advancement of the Jacksonian economic vision in American jurisprudence, though his premature death in 1841 came before he would have had to face as a justice the increasingly contentious issue of slavery that would shortly dominate the national discourse.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Ruling as he did during the Five Dynasties period of Chinese history, the emperor Mingzong (r. 926-933) has not received the same degree attention from historians as have many of his counterparts. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9888208101/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From Warhorses to Ploughshares: The Later Tang Reign of Emperor Mingzong</a> (Hong Kong University Press, 2015), <a href="https://www.ln.edu.hk/history/staff/davis.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard L. Davis</a> provides readers with the first modern biography of Mingzong. Born Miaojilie, Mingzong grew up among his fellow Shatuo Turks and rose to become a leading commander of the forces of the Tang dynasty. After taking the throne in the aftermath of a military rebellion, he managed relations with other states with success and instituted a series of economic reforms designed to encourage trade. Though the territories of the Tang prospered during this period, peace was cut short by Mingzong&#8217;s death, with his dynastic line coming to a violent end less than a decade later. Davis&#8217; book offers a window into a dramatic era in China&#8217;s past, one in which Mingzong&#8217;s reign stood out for its stability amidst the tumult.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Benjamin Disraeli was unique among British prime ministers in the 19th century in many ways, but perhaps none more so than for his career as a novelist. Whereas many scholars have treated Disraeli&#8217;s literary endeavors as an aberration born of financial necessity, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442627069/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disraeli: The Romance of Politics </a>(University of Toronto Press, 2014), <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/english_film_and_theatre/faculty/okell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert O&#8217;Kell</a> presents the novels as key to understanding his inner life and how he conceptualized his political career. Beginning with his participation in publisher John Murray&#8217;s attempt in the 1820s to establish a rival newspaper to The Times, O&#8217;Kell uses Disraeli&#8217;s novels and other writings to illuminate his self-image, one defined by his Jewish ancestry and his own intellectual and rhetorical gifts. Though convinced of his own genius, Disraeli had to overcome both anti-Semitic slurs and the stigma gained as the author of gossipy &#8220;silver-fork&#8221; novels to win election to Parliament and to become the leader of the Conservative Party. Many of his novels reflect his efforts to work out those challenges for himself, serving as a chronicle of his continuing attempts to come to terms with his identity within the context of the society and politics of his era.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Freed begins by describing the historical background of 12th century Germany, setting Frederick&#8217;s succession to the throne within the context of medieval dynastic politics. From there he recounts Frederick&#8217;s campaigns against both the papacy and the Italian communes, his subsequent efforts to strengthen his rule in Germany, and his death in the Near East while participating in the Third Crusade. Though an undercurrent of frustrated ambition ran throughout many of his efforts, Frederick nonetheless became a symbol of a united Germany by the 19th century and, in the process, achieved a stature as a sovereign that belied the complicated realities of the world in which he lived.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Known as the Iron Man of politics, Alben Barkley enjoyed a career that took him from rural Kentucky to the vice-presidency of the United States of America. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813167132/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Alben Barkley: A Life in Politics</a> (University Press of Kentucky, 2016), James K. Libbey draws upon his many years studying Barkley to provide readers with insight into this dynamic and popular figure. Growing up in poverty, Barkley nonetheless acquired an education and began a legal career before his first run for county office. From there he won election to Congress, first as a member of the House of Representatives, then in 1926 as a senator. Once in the Senate he soon emerged as a leader of the Democratic caucus and was elected Majority Leader in 1937, from which position he shepherded through some of the most important legislation of the century. Selected as Harry Truman&#8217;s running mate at the 1948 Democratic National Convention, as vice president he was a nationally popular figure and the first one known by the affectionate moniker &#8220;Veep.&#8221; Though frustrated in his efforts to become the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952, he capped his career by returning to the Senate two years later, providing a fitting coda to his lifetime of public service.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Though in many ways the forgotten man of Irish politics, John Redmond came closer to achieving the long-sought goal of Home Rule for Ireland than had his more illustrious predecessors Daniel O&#8217;Connell and Charles Stewart Parnell. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/190892831X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">John Redmond: The National Leader</a> (Merrion Press, 2014), Dermot Meleady describes how Redmond led the Irish Parliamentary Party to the cusp of this political victory and how it came apart for him. Picking up where his previous volume, Redmond: The Parnellite left off, Meleady introduces his readers to Redmond immediately after his assumption of his party&#8217;s leadership in 1900. With the anti-Home Rule Unionist Party in office, Redmond bided his time by shepherding other reforms that reshaped Irish society. When his party gained the balance of power in Parliament after the elections of 1910 Redmond used his newfound leverage to push Home Rule to the forefront of British politics, winning its passage but bringing Ireland to the brink of civil war by 1914 as a consequence. The outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914 led to a suspension of British politics and triggered a split in the Irish nationalist movement over Redmond&#8217;s appeal to support the war effort a split that, with the British response to the Easter Rising in 1916, led to Redmond&#8217;s political eclipse and the failure of his vision of an autonomous Ireland prospering within the British empire.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[From his modest beginnings in southern Iran, the Persian king Cyrus II went on to conquer three of the dominant kingdoms of the ancient Near East those of the Medians, the Lydians, and the Babylonians and establish the first world empire. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933823380/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Discovering Cyrus: The Persian Conqueror Astride the Ancient World </a>(Mage Pub, 2013), Reza Zarghamee draws upon the available written sources and archaeological record to provide the first comprehensive biography of Cyrus written since the middle of the 19th century. In it he describes Cyrus&#8217;s background, the context for his rise to power, and the empire he built. By detailing the forces he used, the organization of his empire, and his relationship with various groups, Zarghamee provides us with a portrait of a bold conqueror and shrewd ruler who understood the effectiveness of cooperating with the local elites in conquered lands and who established a multicultural realm that would endure for the next two centuries and serve as a model for future empires.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Biography is a genre of largely unexamined power: a literary field that preserves stories of lived lives and, through them, perpetuates notions that there are certain ways lives can be lived. This is particularly true of the lives of women, which are often, in biography, confined to the marriage plot and detailed as events in the lives of men. As <a href="http://www.jessacrispin.com/">Jessa Crispin</a> writes in her new book, T<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022627845X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">he Dead Ladies Project: Exiles, Expats &amp; Ex-Countries</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2015), &#8220;The important task is to understand and modify the stories that are holding sway.&#8221;<br />
The founder and editor of the recently shuttered lit-blog <a href="http://www.bookslut.com/">Bookslut</a>, Crispin spent a year and a half traveling abroad. Her genre-bending book, The Dead Ladies Project, is the legacy of that year and it&#8217;s a work that goes a long way in modifying the stories we typically tell, not just about women but about human beings- as thinkers, travelers, artists, and individuals.<br />
It&#8217;s a contemplative, wandering work, which captures the disorientations of travel, the anxiety/ecstasy of being alone, the ways in which we carry our pasts with us, and the integral role stories play in our understanding of our possibilities and the ways in which we live our lives.&#8221;What saves you is a new story to tell yourself about how things could be,&#8221; Crispin suggests and, as she moves from Berlin, Trieste, Sarajevo, St. Petersburg, contemplating the lives of William James, Nora Barnacle, Rebecca West, and Claude Cahun, she opens up story after story, expanding the narrative possibilities as she goes.<br />
Hers is a story which suggests the richness that comes of bouncing our lives off those of others. &#8220;It was the dead I wanted to talk to,&#8221; she writes, as she sets out on her travels. &#8220;I&#8217;d always been attracted to the unloosed, the wandering souls who were willing to scrape their lives clean and start again elsewhere. I needed to know how they did it, how they survived.&#8221; It&#8217;s an account which suggests the hunger for and value of such stories- the stories of lives which, as Carolyn G. Heilbrun put it, enable us to forge new fictions and new narratives for our own.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[At the start of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803237650/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Grand Old Man of Baseball: Connie Mack in His Final Years, 1932-1956</a>, the third volume of <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Norman_L._Macht" target="_blank">Norman L. Macht&#8217;s</a> biography of baseball legend Connie Mack, the Philadelphia A&#8217;s which he owned and managed had just lost the 1931 World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. Though Mack would run the team for another eighteen seasons, never again would they win a pennant during his tenure. Macht chronicles the team&#8217;s struggles during the Great Depression to stay afloat, as Mack was forced to sell off his best players simply to meet his obligations. By the end of the decade, the improving economic conditions and the adoption of night games improved the financial picture, only for the outbreak of World War II to leave baseball hobbled once more. By the time the A&#8217;s contended for the pennant again in1948, the 86-year-old Mack was slowed by strokes and on the verge of a long-anticipated retirement, yet still managing from the dugout as best he could. Macht shows that, despite Mack&#8217;s willingness to innovate and experiment, his failure to embrace the farm system early on doomed his team to seasonal struggles to post winning records, while his decision to pass along management of the club to his sons Roy and Earle nearly bankrupted the organization and led to their move out of Philadelphia just a few years later.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Thanks to the writings of Procopius and other detractors, the Byzantine empress Theodora (c. 495-548 CE) has long been viewed as a depraved and spiteful woman who was a negative influence on her husband Justinian. In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199740763/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Theodora: Actress, Empress, Saint </a>(Oxford University Press, 2015), historian <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/classics/people/departmental-faculty/dsp.html" target="_blank">David Potter</a> draws upon a wide range of sources to offer a very different view of her life and times. From relatively humble beginnings she became a successful actress and the mistress of a powerful Byzantine official. After being abandoned by her lover, she caught the attention of Justinian, who married her in spite of the risk that doing so posed to his chances of becoming emperor. Once she became empress in 527, she not only undertook the considerable duties of empress but served as well as an influential adviser to her husband, shaping the politics, religion, and society of her age. By setting her into the context of 6th century Byzantium, Potter fills in many of the gaps in our understanding of Theodora, showing in the process just how remarkable she was as both a person and as a leader.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a trailblazing attorney, Bessie Margolin lived a life of exceptional achievement. At a time when the legal profession consisted almost entirely of men, she earned the esteem of her colleagues and rose to become one of the most successful Supreme Court advocates of her era. Doing so, as <a href="http://www.marlenetrestman.com/" target="_blank">Marlene Trestman</a> demonstrates in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807162086/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Fair Labor Lawyer: The Remarkable Life of New Deal Attorney and Supreme Court Advocate Bessie Margolin</a> (Louisiana State University Press, 2016), required overcoming not just the ingrained assumptions that men had towards professional women during that time but also the poverty of her early childhood and the loss of her mother when Margolin was only three years old. As Trestman reveals, Margolin exploited to the full the opportunities she was given as a ward of the Jewish Orphans Home in New Orleans, which provided her with a comfortable upbringing and a good education. From Newcomb College and Tulane University, Margolin went on to a fellowship at Yale University and a career in the federal government, which she began by participating in the defense of some of the most important laws to come out of President Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal program and concluded by championing measures mandating equal pay and opposing age discrimination. And yet Trestman shows that for all of the sacrifices she made to establish a career for herself, Margolin did so on her own terms and in a way that many Americans can relate to today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691142998/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Rise of a Prairie Statesman: The Life and Times of George McGovern </a>(Princeton UP, 2016), the first in a projected two-volume biography of the senator and Democratic Party presidential nominee, <a href="http://www.smu.edu/Dedman/Academics/Departments/History/People/FacultyStaff/ThomasKnock" target="_blank">Thomas Knock</a> chronicles McGovern&#8217;s life and career from his Depression-era upbringing in South Dakota to his 1968 reelection campaign and emergence as a presidential contender. Knock describes McGovern&#8217;s transformation from a shy young boy into a confident debater who, after America went to war in 1941, volunteered for service in the Army Air Corps as a B-24 bomber pilot and flew 35 combat missions over Germany and Austria. Upon returning home, he embarked on a path that took him from the ministry to a Ph.D. in history and then the college classroom before he settled upon a career in politics. After serving two terms in the House of Representatives and as Director of Food for Peace in the Kennedy administration, in 1962 McGovern won a seat in the United States Senate, where he emerged as a prescient critic of America&#8217;s descent into the Vietnam War. In detailing his opposition to that expanding conflict, Knock not only shows how McGovern emerged as a national leader, but also demonstrates the relevance of his vision to the challenges our nation faces today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Few composers dominate a genre of music as completely as did Scott Joplin. From the publication of his iconic Maple Leaf Rag in 1899 onward his ragtime compositions came to serve as the soundtrack of his age. Yet Joplin aspired to be recognized not just as a successful writer of popular tunes but as a respected composer of classical music, an ambition that led him to write a ballet and two operas. In a new edition of his biography of Scott Joplin, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199740321/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">King of Ragtime: Scott Joplin and His Era</a>, the eminent ragtime scholar <a href="http://www.edwardaberlin.com" target="_blank">Ed Berlin</a> reveals many new details that sharpen our understanding of Joplin&#8217;s life and the times in which it was lived. Tracing his life from his childhood in rural Texas to his death in New York City in 1917, he describes Joplin&#8217;s career as a musician and composer, setting it within the context of an African American community seeking to define its place within American society. Through his extensive research, Berlin sheds new light on Joplin&#8217;s personal life, his business affairs, and the public reception of his music, helping us to better understand the impact and legacy of this great American artist.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Roosevelt: Road to the New Deal, 1882-1939</a> (University of Illinois Press, 2015), and Franklin D. Roosevelt: The War Years, 1939-1945 (University of Illinois Press, 2016). Drawing upon Roosevelt&#8217;s speeches, press conferences, and other statements, Daniels argues that Roosevelt was not the second-class intellect deemed by Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. but a person of considerable intellectual ability who possessed a mastery of not just politics but administration as well. When it came to formulating both domestic and foreign policy Daniels credits Roosevelt as being oriented towards the future in ways unlike many of his contemporaries. This emphasis plays a role in shaping national policy not just on the prominent issues such as the role of the government in the economy but on questions of race and immigration as well, both of which undergo slow but significant shifts during his presidency. The looming threat of war in Europe widened Roosevelt&#8217;s scope, and Americas entry into the struggle in 1941 brought with it the opportunity to establish the mechanisms to avoid such global conflicts from happening again. It is thanks to Roosevelt&#8217;s focus and his determination to realize his vision, Daniels concludes, that establishes the saliency of his presidency for us today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Women&#8217;s history, if they had any, consisted in their being beautiful enough to become events in male lives,&#8221; the feminist academic Carolyn R. Heilbrun noted in a series of 1997 lectures, suggesting the need for new narratives and new ways of writing women&#8217;s lives.<br />
<a href="http://www.brookehauser.com/">Brooke Hauser</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enter-Helen-Invention-Gurley-Modern/dp/0062342665/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463737354&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=enter+helen">Enter Helen: The Invention of Helen Gurley Brown and the Rise of the Modern Single Woman</a> is an exciting new entry into group of books that have emerged in the last few years to offer provocative and innovative biographical readings of women&#8217;s lives (<a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/kate-bolick-spinster-making-a-life-of-ones-own-crown-2015/">Kate Bolick&#8217;s Spinster, for example</a>). In Enter Helen, Hauser contextualizes Helen Gurley Brown&#8217;s experience, demonstrating how the times in which she lived affected her and she, in turn, affected them.<br />
In many ways a misfit, Gurley Brown&#8217;s approach made many in the women&#8217;s movement uneasy. Rather than arguing for the overthrow of the patriarchy, she advocated that women use everything at their disposal to make it in a man&#8217;s world. Advice that might ring a little retro, it was nonetheless well intentioned. And, in a long career devoted to the advancement of women, Gurley Brown worked tirelessly to make visible narratives that might otherwise have remained unavailable to her readers.<br />
She did not think she was beautiful and her life was far more than an event in the life of a man. It was the main event, and it&#8217;s a life whose impact continues to be felt to this day- particularly in the magazine and advertising industries but also in the lives of single women discovering and re-discovering<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Single-Girl-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/B000Q3YP8Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463738186&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sex+and+the+single+girl"> her classic book</a>.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1605988723/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Napoleon: Soldier of Destiny</a> (Pegasus, 2015) the inaugural volume of a projected three-volume biography of the French ruler <a href="http://www.lmh.ox.ac.uk/Tutors/Fellows/Profiles/Broers.aspx" target="_blank">Michael Broer</a>s&#8217; takes a different approach. Drawing upon a new and vastly expanded collection of Napoleons letters to chronicle his subjects life from his early years in Corsica to the eve of his 1805 campaign, Broers focuses on his achievements in politics and state-building. He sees Napoleon&#8217;s time as conqueror and ruler of Italy as key both to his emergence as a prospective leader and to the development of his ideas of governance. Though applied bluntly in Egypt, their legacy in Napoleons development of the French state during his subsequent years as First Consul and as emperor are made clear by the author, who details how they created not just the structure of administration France uses to this day but more modern and uniform states throughout much of Europe as well.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

These are the questions driving the narrative in <a href="http://www.ingridcarlberg.se/en/" target="_blank">Ingrid Carlberg</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1681444909/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Raoul Wallenberg: The Biography</a> (MacLehose Press, 2016). A diplomatic envoy in Hungary, Wallenberg has been lauded throughout the world for his efforts to save Jews living during World War II. But, his fate following his arrest in 1945 remains unknown and, as a result, his story has no clear end. In her excellent biography, Carlberg excavates the details of Wallenberg&#8217;s end, but she also digs deeply into the story of his life- shedding light upon a time that is often eclipsed by all that came after. It&#8217;s a time which is essential to any understanding of the man Wallenberg was,the course he pursued, and the hero he&#8217;s remembered as.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://clemson.academia.edu/PeterLaurence">Peter L. Laurence</a> is an associate professor of urban design, history and theory at Clemson University School of Architecture. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812247884/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Becoming Jane Jacobs</a> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2016) is an intellectual biography of the architecture critic and neo-functionist Jane Jacobs and how she came to write the 1961 classic The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Beginning with Jacobs&#8217;s arrival in New York City in 1934 with only a high school diploma and writing aspirations Laurence follows her career to the pages of Architectural Forum under the editorial direction of Douglas Haskell. At the magazine she honed her critical skills and was exposed to the latest in urban design and renewal working with leading architects and planners. Laurence argues that there are persistent myths about Jacobs, including her status as a housewife and an amateur urban activist who surprisingly wrote a classic, or a genius. Rather, Jacobs transformed herself into a sophisticated critic influenced by the ideas of a wide circle of intellectuals and wrote a great deal before and after her most well known work. Death and Life of Great American Cities synthesized many previous ideas and proposed a new way to think about cities that considered the social networks and perspective of the person on the street rather than top-down planning that disregarded the human element for efficiency and form. Her vision for the city was of a living system with flexibility, creativity, and diversity offering a sense of connection by mixing the old and the new. Laurence offers not only the evolution of Jacobs&#8217;s ideas but also the ways mid-century intellectuals conceived of the cities we now live in.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Considered by many to be the greatest American film ever made, Citizen Kane was the product of Orson Welles, who made a movie that is still groundbreaking today. In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250077532/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Citizen Kane: A Filmmaker&#8217;s Journey</a> (Thomas Dunne Books, 2016), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harlan-Lebo/e/B001IODOYQ" target="_blank">Harlan Lebo</a> presents a wonderful overview of the film on its 75th anniversary. He used previous interviews with some of the people involved in the production, along with archival information not previously used by other writers. He is able to show how the movie deserves its reputation as a masterpiece.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;There still exists little organized sense of what a woman&#8217;s biography or autobiography should look like,&#8221; Carolyn G. Heilbrun wrote in her 1988 classic, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Womans-Life-Carolyn-Heilbrun/dp/0393331644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461044958&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=writing+a+woman%27s+life" target="_blank">Writing A Woman&#8217;s Life</a>, noting, &#8220;Even less has been told of the life of the unmarried woman.&#8221; One can only hope that <a href="http://www.katebolick.com/" target="_blank">Kate Bolick</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Spinster-Making-Life-Ones-Own/dp/0385347138/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1461044732&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Spinster</a> is a sign that, nearly thirty years later, the circumstances Heilbrun described are, at long last, about to change.<br />
Bolick burst onto the national scene when her article in The Atlantic, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/11/all-the-single-ladies/308654/" target="_blank">All the Single Ladies</a>,&#8221; went viral in November 2011. But Spinster is a departure from her reportage rather than a continuation or a sequel&#8211; a biographical/autobiographical/sociological mash-up that is engaging, observant, and fiercely critical. Examining the socio-historical phenomenon of the feme sole, Bolick mines her own experiences and the lives she&#8217;s read about to examine how, as Heilbrun suggested, we use the stories of other lives to navigate our own. &#8220;Taken together,&#8221; Bolick writes of the people whose lives interested her, &#8220;they were a dynasty of adopted uncles and aunts adults who weren&#8217;t my parents who opened portals to lives I couldn&#8217;t have imagined until they showed me how.&#8221;<br />
This is a process of which we are often unconscious as it&#8217;s happening, but which becomes visible in hindsight. It is also, I believe, one of the great values of reading biography: the ability of these stories of other people&#8217;s lives to open possibilities within our own. It&#8217;s a dynamic not limited to stories of the lives of women, but it does appear to hold particular resonance for female readers, perhaps due to the relative cultural scarcity of representations of unconventional female lives. In her quest to become a writer, Bolick notes, &#8220;Maeve Brennan served a psychological purpose for me. By climbing into her point of view and trying it on for size I was cobbling together a template for my own future.&#8221;<br />
Spinster provides compelling evidence of both the personal and collective power of stories and our use of them. It also reveals something of the life of the unmarried woman, elegantly illuminating an experience that has, up to now, been culturally undervalued and, often, biographically ignored.<br />

Held identifies a central theme that runs through all of Heschel&#8217;s writing: the idea of transcendence&#8211;the movement from self-centeredness to God-centeredness. For Heschel, prayer is the paradigmatic spiritual act, one that tries to bring God back into the world.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In anticipation of Super Bowl 50, Sports Illustrated and WIRED magazines teamed up to speculate about the state of football fifty years from now, at the time of <a href="http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/07/super-bowl-100-coverage-hub" target="_blank">Super Bowl 100</a>. Of course, the big question that arises when considering the future of the football is whether the sport will even exist decades from now, given the evidence of severe brain disease in many former players. Historian <a href="https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/history/jdesjardins.htm">Julie Des Jardins</a> argues that if we want to gain a better understanding of the current challenges to football, it&#8217;s best to look back to its early decades. Football had its critics from the very beginning, when young men were severely injured and even killed on the field. The sport had to reform itself to survive. As Julie shows in her new biography of legendary Yale coach Walter Camp, even the founding father of American football recognized that change was necessary for the game to continue.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199925623/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Walter Camp: Football and the Modern Man </a>(Oxford University Press, 2015), Julie presents the first scholarly biography of the man who devised the rules that distinguished American football from its English forebears, rugby and soccer. For decades, from the 1880s until his death in 1925, he was a leading figure in shaping how the game was played as well as the broader culture of football. A self-made man of unfailing character, Camp saw football as the ideal exercise for training young men of courage and morality. At the same time, he understood the need to adapt his convictions; Camp named non-white players to his All-America team, and he came to accept professional football as a legitimate option for players leaving college. Camp always insisted that physical violence was the incontestable core of football, but he also recognized the changes of the times and held  that football had to meet them.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On August 21, 1933, the teenaged Violette Noziere attempted to kill both her parents.<br />
At first, seemingly so clearcut, the case ultimately came to be characterized by a &#8220;troubling ambiguity&#8221; that unsettled Paris for years.<br />
Were the Nozieresan upstanding middle-class family? Was Violette a victim of sexual assault, her father a heinous predator? Was Violette a sexual degenerate? In an age of unprecedented social mobility, had the family tragically overstepped, with the parents granting a wild daughter too much freedom? No one knew.<br />
It was the perfect cautionary tale of the time- giving voice to concerns of contemporary France&#8217;s, fears of changing attitudes towards gender, class, industry, economics, art, everything. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Violette-NoziÃ¨re-Story-Murder-1930s/dp/0520272722">Violette Noziere: A Story of Murder in 1930s Paris</a>, <a href="http://www.history.northwestern.edu/people/maza.html">Sarah Maza</a> weaves together social history with an astute analysis of the times to paint a vivid portrait of Noziere&#8217;s society, her circumstances and her crime.<br />
It&#8217;s a gripping tale that provides an intimate glimpse into a period that is often overshadowed: Paris of the 1930s, transfixed by a story of parricide and incest, tensed for the war that is about to come.<br />

This is one of those rare books that, when you have finished a section, you are torn between going on to the next section and re-reading the last section to make sure that you got everything out of it. The subtitle of the book is &#8220;A Mathematician Explores the Vagaries of Life, His Own and Probably Yours&#8221;. You&#8217;ll be a little skeptical about that subtitle before you read the book, but when you finish it, you&#8217;ll realize the subtitle nails it &#8212; he&#8217;s talking, not just about himself, but about you. fascinating read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://meganmarshallauthor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Megan Marshall</a> is the Charles Wesley Emerson College Professor in writing, literature and publishing. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/054424561X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Margaret Fuller: A New American Life</a> (Mariner Books, 2013) won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize in biography. Marshall has written a beautiful and detailed portrait of the nineteenth-century political thinker, women&#8217;s rights advocate, and writer Margaret Fuller. Fuller&#8217;s childhood begins in Cambridgeport, MA where under the tutelage of her demanding father, Timothy Fuller, she was immersed in the classics excelling in language, literature, and philosophy. Her prospects limited by her gender, considered plain and often lonely, Fuller went on to build an intellectual life and relationships with the leading transcendentalists. Her New England circles included the most prominent thinkers of her day, the Channings, the Peabody sisters, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horace Greeley, and Nathaniel Hawthrone. Frequently earning a living as a teacher, she went on to write and edit the transcendentalist journal The Dial and began a series of lectures and discussion for women known as &#8220;conversations.&#8221; The erudite and intellectually confident Fuller struggled with creating and living out a new feminine ideal that included the life of the mind, intimate cross-gender friendships, and mutuality, which she attempted to work out in her relationships with Emerson, James Clarke and others. After her tragic death at sea in 1850, she is best remembered for her book Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845), at the time considered controversial and bold, explored the assumed nature of men and women and their relationship and proposed a new model for egalitarian marriages of mutuality and respect. Marshall has given us a compassionate biography of a remarkable woman who was born ahead of her time and inspired generations of feminists.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Life must have a father and mother&#8230;Science! I&#8217;m going to plant a bomb under its ass!&#8221;<br />
The author of the line above &#8211; who scrawled it in his private diary in the midst of a series of experiments in which he thought he was creating structures that were some kind of transitional stage between the living and nonliving &#8211; had quite a life. A &#8220;midwife to the sexual revolution of the 1960s&#8221; who was famed for his work on the science of orgasm, was widely maligned as a charlatan and pseudoscientist, did extensive work on the science of cancer, had his books and instruments publicly burned by the US government, and died in prison: it&#8217;s hard not to find Wilhelm Reich fascinating. In his new book, <a href="http://www.fandm.edu/james-strick" target="_blank">James E. Strick</a> reminds us that Reich was also a diligent and accomplished laboratory scientist whose work has potentially important implications for the modern biosciences. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674736095/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Wilhelm Reich, Biologist</a> (Harvard University Press, 2015) takes readers into the making of this modern scientist, from his early relationships with Freud and dialectical materialism, to his work on the orgasm as a kind of &#8220;electrophysiological discharge,&#8221; to his research into potential treatments for cancer. The book concludes by considering why understanding Reich&#8217;s scientific work matters for us today, including a brief introduction to some recent experimental work related to Reich&#8217;s research. It is an absorbing story that&#8217;s also a pleasure to read, and pays careful attention to Reich&#8217;s scientific work while still translating it in clear terms for non-specialist readers.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=mhu" target="_blank">Minghui Hu</a>&#8216;s new book takes Dai Zhen as a case study to look at broader transformations in classical scholarship, technical methodologies, politics, and their relationships in the Qing period. This story of Dai Zhen begins before his birth and ends after his death, extending from a moment in which the Jesuits were denounced as &#8220;seditious foreigners&#8221; in 1664, to around 1800, when Dai&#8217;s classical vision was used by the Qing state as a kind of political-scientific legitimation of their rule. Dai Zhen&#8217;s methodology became the groundwork for a new political philosophy, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0295994762/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">China&#8217;s Transition to Modernity: The New Classical Vision of Dai Zhen</a> (University of Washington Press, 2015) takes that methodology and Dai&#8217;s technical accomplishments seriously. Hu&#8217;s book embeds a history of Dai&#8217;s work and legacy within a broader treatment of the work of European scholars and their legacy in shaping eighteenth and nineteenth century discourse, and it offers a fascinating window into an important aspect of the history of Qing science, scholarship, and politics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Muhammad is remembered in a multitude of ways, by both Muslims and non-Muslims. And through each retelling we learn a great deal not only about Muhammad but about the social milieu of the authors. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674050606/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lives of Muhammad</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.bu.edu/religion/people/faculty/bios/kecia-ali/" target="_blank">Kecia Ali</a>, Associate Professor of Religion at Boston University, explores how several central components of the Muhammad biographical narrative are reframed by various authors within modern accounts. We find that biographers&#8217; notions of historicity changed over time, emphasis on the miraculous and supernatural events in Muhammad&#8217;s life are interpreted differently, and Muhammad&#8217;s network of relationships, including successors, companions, and family members gain wider interest during this period. We also find that from the nineteenth century onwards, Muhammad is often framed within the history of &#8216;great men,&#8217; alongside figures like Jesus, Buddha, or Plato. Descriptions of Muhammad&#8217;s life cross a range of genres, such as hagiographical, polemical, political, or seeking to facilitate inter-religious dialogue. In our conversation we just begin to scratch the service of this rich book, including Ibn Ishaq, sexual ethics, revisionism, Muhammad&#8217;s first wife, Khadija, and young wife, Aisha, Orientalist William Muir, polygamy, attempts to counter perceived Western misinterpretations, marital ideals, and contemporary anti-Muslim animus.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As I imagine most any biographer will tell you, one of the great joys and privileges of biographical research is using archives. This is where one encounters tangible pieces of the subject&#8217;s life- letters, diaries, receipts, knick-knacks; one never knows what one will find. But how to incorporate that experience into a book? This is one of many compellingly original angles that <a href="https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/staff/hay/" target="_blank">Daisy Hay</a> brings to the story of Benjamin and Mary Anne Disraeli in her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0374270635/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli: A Strange Romance</a> (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2015)<br />
The story of Benjamin and Mary Anne Disraeli occurs  in a moment of changing attitudes towards marriage,  celebrity and love- a moment more often seen through the eyes of men and viewed in terms of &#8220;history.&#8221; Using the Mary Anne Disraeli archive at the Bodleian Library in Oxford- assembled  by Mrs. Disraeli herself- Hay opens up this  story in two ways: by bringing the voices and experiences of  women into it, and by considering the Disraeli&#8217;s as &#8220;born storytellers&#8221; in 19th century world that was &#8220;thick with stories.  &#8220;They themselves spun stories  around their partnership,&#8221; Hay writes, &#8220;but they also made the tales they spun come true.&#8221; It&#8217;s an illuminating perspective from which to write a biography of public figures,  and also one which highlights  the vital importance of archives in the preservation of  stories of the past.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://davidson.edu/academics/history/faculty-and-staff/sally-mcmillen" target="_blank">Sally G. McMillen</a> is the Mary Reynolds Babcock professor of history at Davidson College. In her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199778396/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Lucy Stone: An Unapologetic Life</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015) McMillen has given us a rich biography of the life and times of the abolitionist and women&#8217;s rights advocate Lucy Stone. Born in 1818 into a farming community in Massachusetts, Stone a precocious and determined girl set her sights not on marriage but on education and self-development leading her to a earning a degree from Oberlin College. Against her parents&#8217; wishes for their daughter, she chose to pursue a career as a public speaker on behalf of abolition and women&#8217;s rights. Rising from relative obscurity she became known as a passionate and persuasive speaker crisscrossing the country and speaking to thousands. Her gender, her confident demeanor, and the unpopular views brought both admiring and hostile audiences. Along the way, she forged political alliances and personal friendships with the leading abolitionists and women&#8217;s rights advocates including Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, William Lloyd Garrison, Lucretia Mott, and Wendell Phillips. Her many associations including significant contributions to the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, American Equal Rights Association, and founding the American Woman Suffrage Association and the Woman&#8217;s Journal framed her 50-year career. McMillen also provides a private portrait of a principled Lucy Stone battling bouts of self-doubt, exhaustive travel, and difficult financial and political challenges within and without the suffrage movement. As the mother of Alice Stone Blackwell and the wife of Henry Browne Blackwell, her partner- in-arms, she undertook a domestic life that stood against the marital customs of her day. Avoiding self-promotion and refusing to participate in building her historical legacy she was left out of the national Memorial Sculpture to women&#8217;s rights at the U.S. Capitol rotunda diminishing her place among Mott, Stanton and Anthony. McMillen recovers not only a committed advocate but also one who against societal norms lived out her ideals of an independent, full, and self-directed life for women.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As <a href="http://www.merylesecrest.com/">Meryle Secrest</a> notes in the introduction to her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elsa-Schiaparelli-Biography-Meryle-Secrest/dp/030770159X">Elsa Schiaparelli: A Biography </a>(Knopf, 2014),&#8221;The most extraordinary fashion designer of the twentieth century is now just a name on a perfume bottle.&#8221; Were it not a book about Schiaparelli, it&#8217;s a sentence many people might assume was being applied to Coco Chanel, for Chanel looms large as the fashion designer of the last century. But Schiaparelli was, as Secrest reveals, more than a fashion designer: she was an artist. And, through her collaborations with SalvadoreDali, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray and others, she was in the vanguard of surrealism and transformed women&#8217;s fashions into an art form.<br />
Who was Schiap? It&#8217;s hard to know. But then we can never know everything about another person, which iswhat makes reading biography so beguiling: the illusion that we could. It&#8217;s a circumstance Secret openly acknowledges. &#8220;A great many aspects of Elsa Schiaparelli&#8217;s life will probably never be known,&#8221; Secrestwrites. &#8220;She was not much of a letter writer&#8230; If she had a diary, it has not survived. Her memoir is an example of an evasiveness that was almost automatic.&#8221; And yet, there are things we can know: Schiaparelli&#8217;s &#8220;gambler&#8217;s instinct&#8221; and &#8220;conjurer&#8217;s sleight of hand&#8221;; that she was famously difficult, a perfectionist, voracious reader, and excellent skier; that smoking was her one indulgence.<br />
She was, also, an extraordinarily gifted artist who worked very, very hard. In 1922, she had &#8220;no money, no career, no future, and a very sick daughter.&#8221; Five years later, Vogue was callingher V-neck  sweater with 3/4-sleeves and a trump l&#8217;oeil bow &#8220;an artistic masterpiece.&#8221; Secrest&#8217;s biography is, ultimately, a compelling story of a complicated, determinedworking woman, and we need all the stories like that we can get.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I have really enjoyed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Leggiere" target="_blank">Michael Leggiere</a>&#8216;s earlier work, including the excellent Napoleon and Berlin : The Franco-Prussian War in North Germany, 1813 (2002), like this work, part of the Campaigns and Commanders series at the University of Oklahoma Press. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806144092/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Blucher: Scourge of Napoleon</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2014), Leggiere rescues Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher from the shadow cast by Wellington (and Wellington&#8217;s many and prolific admirers). It was Blucher, argues Leggiere, who continually bedeviled Napoleon after 1812 and who created the conditions for the Emperor&#8217;s few but decisive defeats, including Leipzig (1813) and Waterloo (1815) &#8211; hence the subtitle. Partly because of the focus on Wellington, partly because of myth-making on the part of German nationalists and military leaders, Blucher is too often presented as a strategic imbecile, a mere hard-charging hussar, deserving of the label applied by his troops: &#8220;Marshal Forward.&#8221; But Leggiere highlights Blucher&#8217;srestraint, his canny retreats, as well as his political savvy, to present a much more nuanced picture.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806144092/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Blucher: Scourge of Napoleon</a> was the winner of the 2015 Society for Military History Distinguished Book Award.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://soci.ubc.ca/persons/thomas-kemple/" target="_blank">Thomas Kemple</a>&#8216;s new book is an extraordinarily thoughtful invitation to approach Max Weber (1864-1920) as a performer, and to experience Weber&#8217;s work by attending to his spoken and written voice. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNEDPR6/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Intellectual Work and the Spirit of Capitalism: Weber&#8217;s Calling </a>(Palgrave Macmillan, 2014) looks carefully at the literary structure and aesthetic elements of Weber&#8217;s arguments, considering how the texts offer an &#8220;allegorical resource for thinking sociologically.&#8221; Kemple argues that the formal structure of Weber&#8217;s ideas is inseparable from the content, and that understanding one is crucial for understanding the other. As a way into that formal structure, in each chapter Kemple offers an ingenious visual diagram that acts as a kind of &#8220;talking picture,&#8221; simultaneously evoking the cinematic elements of Weber&#8217;s own work and giving readers another tool for engaging the performative aspects of it. Kemple&#8217;s book is particularly attentive to the ways that Weber&#8217;s performance is shaped by a close engagement with the work of other writers, musicians, and thinkers, from Goethe and Tolstoy to Machiavelli and Martin Luther, and from the Bhagavadgita to The Valkyries. In addition, Marianne Weber &#8211; Max&#8217;s &#8220;wife, intellectual partner, and posthumous editor&#8221; &#8211; is an important presence throughout the book in helping us understand and read Weber&#8217;s work anew. Kemple&#8217;s thoughtful and beautifully written analysis helps us understand not just Weber&#8217;s own work, but also the value of that work for attending to issues of our own present.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Wilding">Nick Wilding</a>&#8216;s new book is brilliant, thoughtful, and an absolute pleasure to read. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022616697X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Galileo&#8217;s Idol: Gianfrancesco Sagredo and The Politics of Knowledge </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2014) takes an unusual approach to understanding Galileo and his context by focusing its narrative on his closest friend, student, and patron, the Venetian Gianfrancesco Sagredo. Though most readers might be familiar with Sagredo largely as one of the protagonists of Galileo&#8217;s 1632 Dialogue upon the Two Main Systems of the World, here he takes center stage. In order to bring Sagredo to life and help us understand his significance both for Galileo and for early modern science in context more broadly conceived, Wilding has worked with an impressive range of materials that include poems, paintings, ornamental woodcuts, epistolary hoaxes, intercepted letters, murder case files, and more. After a chapter that reads like a detective story as Wilding tracks down and expertly reads missing portraits of Sagredo, subsequent chapters explore the Venetian&#8217;s role in major disputes involving the Jesuits, his family&#8217;s mining interests, his time as treasurer for a fortress and a consul to Syria, and his performance as a &#8220;rich, old, slightly batty widow&#8221; in the context of a rather hilarious epistolary hoax. We also come to understand Galileo anew, as Wilding pays careful attention to his use of scribal publication to control and disseminate his writing and the relationship between instrument and text in his work. (In one wonderful chapter, Wilding reads woodcuts associated with the Sidereus nuncius in order to reframe how we understand the history of production and publication of this text in the context of transalpine book smuggling.) Along the way, the chapters make significant interventions in the historiography of science, suggesting ways that Sagredo helps us think anew about the use of visual sources, the agency of &#8220;intermediaries and go-betweens&#8221; in creating their own networks, the importance of understanding the sense of humor of our historical actors, the social nature of early modern authorship, and the need to reassess the historiography of the global scientific network of the Jesuits.<br />
There are also some really, horribly, wonderfully bad puns. (Consider yourselves forewarned.)<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Biography is, both etymologically and in its conventional forms, the writing of a life. But what is the role of place within that? And how do the stories of lives- some of them well known, others less so- realign when we see them through the lens of a particular place? That&#8217;s <a href="http://justinmartin1.com/">Justin Martin</a>&#8216;s way in to the stories of Walt Whitman, Artemus Ward, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Adah Menken and Edwin Booth, among others: their convergence, many an evening, at Pfaff&#8217;s basement saloon in mid-19th century Manhattan.<br />
Don&#8217;t let the name-check in the title fool you. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0306822261/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Rebel Souls: Walt Whitman and America&#8217;s First Bohemians</a> (Da Capo Press, 2014) is just as much about the other bohemians as it is about Whitman, and the Whitman we find here may not be the Whitman we thought we knew. He&#8217;s younger- his fate yet to be determined- and he&#8217;s paling around with a cast of characters equally compelling.<br />
<br />
When he went to Paris in 1849, Henry Clapp Jr. was so impressed with the local artsy-types that he decided to export their way of life to America, to consciously found a group of bohemians back in New York. And it&#8217;s the saloon where they congregated that first drew Martin to his story. Though his characters fan out across the country over the course of the narrative, they came from Pfaff&#8217;s and they seem to carry it with them wherever they go.Place plays a fundamental role in life and should, by extension, feature within the subsequent tellings of a life as well, but it&#8217;s a factor that is, all too often, unexamined at this level- the level of where one eats and drinks and hangs out. Places are ever-changing, Manhattan real estate most especially. But, as Rebel Souls proves, biography can play a provocative role in preserving their mystique and also their impact&#8211; recapturing the barroom beneath the city streets, the chatter swirling around the budding poet, the raucous laughter of his companions, the ice cubes clinking in the glass. The knowledge that this is where they came from, that this is where they were off-stage or on break, not only offers fresh insight into the things they were able to create, but it also reveals tantalizing dimensions of who they might have been.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the fundamental functions of biography is the preservation of stories. But it also acts to resurrect the stories that may have fallen from view, reinvigorating the tales of people who, with the passage of time, have become merely names on plaques. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1613745362/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">La Belle Creole:The Cuban Countess Who Captivated Havana, Madrid, and Paris </a>(Chicago Review Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.alinagarcialapuerta.com/">Alina Garcia-Lapuerta</a> aims to do just that: vividly drawing the story of Mercedes Santa Cruz y Montalvo, a woman who was tremendously famous during her lifetime but who has since fallen into relative obscurity, especially in America. Many Cubans and Cuban Americans will be familiar with her name, but many others will never have heard of her, a misfortune thatGarcia-Lapuerta&#8217;s work will hopefully correct.<br />
Just on the surface, there&#8217;s a compelling plot: a Cuban girl leaves home and meets with social triumph in Europe, where she is hostess of one of the most famous salons of her day. But its the theme of ex-patriotism, whichGarcia-Lapuerta (an ex-pat herself) elegantly weaves throughout, that is most striking. The longing to return to Cuba and, ultimately, to write about it. Anyone who&#8217;s ever lived abroad will recognize the tensions described when Mercedes visits her homeland only to leave it again, but this is a theme that doesn&#8217;t always make it into biographies- at least not biographies of people who didn&#8217;t live in Paris in the 1920s. It&#8217;s even less visible in books about the lives of 19th century figures and, therefore, all the more welcome and provocative here.<br />
Garcia-Lapuerta has done a tricky thing. She&#8217;s written a book about someone a lot of people will not have heard of, from a place to which a lot of Americans, at least, will not have been. And yet she makes both the Cuba of old and her heroine feel hauntingly familiar, breathtakingly real.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Patrice Lumumba was a leader of the independence struggle, as well as the country&#8217;s first democratically elected prime minister, in what is today the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After a meteoric rise in the colonial civil service and the African political elite, he became a major figure in the decolonization movement of the 1950s. Lumumba&#8217;s short tenure as prime minister was marked by an uncompromising defense of Congolese national interests against pressure from international mining companies and the Western governments that orchestrated his eventual demise.<br />
Cold war geopolitical maneuvering and efforts by Lumumba&#8217;s domestic adversaries culminated in his assassination, with the support or at least tacit complicity of the U.S. and Belgian governments, the CIA, and the UN Secretariat. <a href="https://afriafam.unc.edu/people/georges-nzongola-ntalaja" target="_blank">Georges Nzongola</a>&#8216;s concise book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0821421255/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Patrice Lumumba</a> (Ohio University Press, 2014) provides a contemporary analysis of Lumumba&#8217;s life and work, examining his strengths and weaknesses as a political leader. It also surveys the national, continental, and international contexts of Lumumba&#8217;s political ascent and his elimination by the interests threatened by his ideas and reforms.<br />
Lumumba&#8217;s death, his integrity and dedication to ideals of self-determination, self-reliance, and pan-African solidarity assure him a prominent place among the heroes of the 20th century African independence movement and the African Diaspora.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his biography of Jozef Tiso, Catholic priest and president of independent Slovakia (1939-1944), <a title="James Mace Ward" href="http://www.uri.edu/artsci/his/Ward.html" target="_blank">James Ward</a> provides a deeper understanding of a man who has been both honored and vilified since his execution as a Nazi collaborator in 1947. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080144988X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Priest, Politician, Collaborator: Jozef Tiso and the Making of Fascist Slovakia</a> (Cornell University Press, 2013) is also a fascinating look at Catholicism, nationalism and human rights as moral standards in 20th century East Central Europe. The book explores both the political and social contexts that shaped Tiso and the choices he made in attempts to shape the country in which he lived &#8211; whether Habsburg Hungary, interwar Czechoslovakia or a Slovak republic.  Ward reveals, as well, how the fight over Tiso&#8217;s legacy in post-communist Slovakia mirrored the polarization of Slovak politics at the end of the 20th century.<br />
Priest, Politician, Collaborator was the 2014 Honorable Mention for the Reginald Zelnik Book Prize in History from the Association for Slavic, East European and Eurasian Studies.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/S.-Duncan-Reid/e/B00CJ42T68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S. Duncan Reid</a> has written a meticulously researched and detailed account of the performances and recording career of Bay Area-raised and small group Latin-jazz innovator and vibraphonist Cal Tjader. Tjader&#8217;s high-energy yet lyrical and melodic playing introduced new demographics of jazz listeners to the soulful sound of Latin jazz for four decades beginning in the 1940s and ending with Tjader&#8217;s untimely death at the age of 56 in 1982.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0786435356/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cal Tjader: The Life and Recordings of the Man Who Revolutionized Latin Jazz</a> (McFarland, 2013), Reid details Tjader&#8217;s uncanny ability to soak up ever-evolving stylistic and percussive nuances &#8211; and discusses his collaborations with and influences on other Latin jazz innovators such as Mongo Santamaria, Willie Bobo, Poncho Sanchez, Vince Guaraldi, Michael Wolff and many, many more.<br />
Reid recounts how Mario Bauza, Machito, Tito Puente, Dizzy Gillespie, and Stan Kenton, among others, had influenced the Latin jazz scene in the 1940s with their exciting big band/orchestral sound &#8211; and that the majority of influential jazz critics were &#8220;East of the Mississippi.&#8221;<br />
One of the delights in Reid&#8217;s book is to see how Tjader, with his San Francisco Bay Area roots and a European family background, nonetheless was attracted to and became an innovator in the small-group Latin jazz scene.<br />
Cal Tjader was literally born to rhythm. His father, of Swedish descent, was a talented vaudevillian. His Idaho-born mother played classical piano. Tjader&#8217;s parents opened a popular dance studio in San Mateo, California in the late 1920s. Tjader was already tap dancing in front of audiences by the age of 4 and as a child even danced with tap dance legend Bill &#8220;Bojangles&#8221; Robinson on a Hollywood set in the early 1930s. Forsaking tap dancing in high school, Tjader picked up drums and within three years won a Gene Krupa drum contest playing &#8220;Drum Boogie.&#8221; News of his success, however, was &#8220;overshadowed&#8221; by another news event &#8211;the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br />
After serving in the South Pacific in WWII, Tjader returned to the San Francisco Bay area, attended San Francisco State College and soon began collaborating with other West Coast jazz musicians &#8211; most notably Dave Brubeck (Tjader started out as a drummer for Brubeck in the late 1940s and subsequently the vibes), and sax player Paul Desmond. It wasn&#8217;t long, however, before Tjader became enamored of the infectious and complex percussive permutations in Afro-Cuban rhythms after meeting Cuban percussionist Armando Peraza in San Francisco early in 1950. Reid also writes that Tjader&#8217;s collaborations/recordings with classically trained jazz pianist George Shearing were central to Tjader&#8217;s own evolution in the small-group Latin sound. Shearing called Tjader a &#8220;percussive genius.&#8221;<br />
Tjader always had a lyrical quality to his playing &#8211; he left space and was always looking for new compositional challenges, and it wasn&#8217;t long before Tjader became a fixture in the small-group Latin jazz scene in San Francisco, playing gigs at the most famous San Francisco clubs of the day &#8211; notably The Blackhawk, The Great American Music Hall, and the El Matador.<br />
Tjader is probably most associated with his catchy cover of the Gillespie/Pozo hit Guarachi Guaro on his Grammy-nominated album Soul Sauce in 1964. Tjader later won a Grammy for his album La Onda Va Bien, recorded in 1979.<br />
Reid is upfront about Tjader&#8217;s problems with alcohol and challenging family dynamics but doesn&#8217;t psychologize &#8211; he lets his interviewees do the talking.]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There was once a notion that black people had no meaningful history. It&#8217;s a notion Dorothy Porter Wesley spent her entire career debunking. Through her 43 years at Howard University, where she helped create the <a href="http://library.howard.edu/library">Moorland-Spingarn Research Center</a>, her own publishing endeavors and collecting, and her unfettered support of the researchers she encountered, Wesley devoted her entire life to the preservation of black history.<br />
Her career was once summed up as that of a &#8220;historical detective&#8221;, and the characterization is apt. As <a href="http://pgccblog.pgcc.edu/IQ/2014/04/24/dr-janet-sims-wood-receives-2014-james-partridge-award/" target="_blank">Dr. Janet Sims-Wood</a> writes in her excellent study, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dorothy-Porter-Wesley-Howard-University/dp/1626196443/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413299268&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=janet+sims-wood">Dorothy Porter Wesley at Howard University: Building a Legacy of Black History</a> (The History Press, 2014) she was unrelenting in her mission: &#8220;To supplement her meager acquisitions budget, Porter appealed to faculty to donate manuscripts of their published works as well as any letters from noted individuals. [&#8230;] she appealed to publishers, authors and friends who were collectors to donate their materials. She also rummaged through the attics and basements of recently deceased persons to acquire materials.&#8221; The portrait that emerges is that of an indefatigable, iconic archivist, a researcher&#8217;s dream.<br />
But, beyond the life, there is the legacy. A mighty legacy, as Sims-Wood establishes. Sims-Wood is an oral historian and she assembles here an interesting chorus of voices: those who knew Dorothy Porter Wesley, who worked with her, who watched her, whose lives and careers were impacted by her.<br />
Timed to coincide with the centenary of the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Sims-Wood&#8217;s book is an important reminder of how much the preservation of history relies upon individuals. And, also, what a significant impact one person can have.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Thomas Sankara, often called the African Che Guevara, was president of Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in Africa, until his assassination during a military coup that brought down his government. Although his time in office was relatively short, Sankara left an indelible mark on his country&#8217;s history and development. But as <a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty/ernest-w-harsch" target="_blank">Ernest Harsch</a> explains in his engaging biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0821421263/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Thomas Sankara: An African Revolutionary</a> (Ohio University Press, 2014), Sankara&#8217;s influence extends beyond Burkina Faso. Sankara was a moral force and an ardent spokesman for African dignity and struggle against neocolonial forces and Western economic domination. Harsch traces Sankara&#8217;s life from his student days to his recruitment into the military, his early political awakening, and his increasing dismay with his country&#8217;s extreme poverty and political corruption. Sankara and his colleagues initiated economic and social policies that shifted Burkina Faso away from dependence on foreign aid and toward a greater use of the country&#8217;s own resources to build schools, health clinics, and public works. Although Sankara&#8217;s sweeping vision and practical reforms won him admirers both within and without Burkina Faso, a combination of domestic opposition and factions within his own government and the army led to his assassination in 1987.<br />
Harsch has written the first English-language book that relates the story of Sankara&#8217;s life and achievements. Based on extensive firsthand research in Burkina Faso as well as interviews with Sankara himself, this brief biography will give this neglected hero of the African revolution the attention he deserves.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the early 1830s, the French school teacher EugÃ©nie Luce migrated to Algeria. A decade later, she was a major force in the debates around educational practices there, insisting that not only were women entitled to quality education, but that women&#8217;s education served a fundamental role in the French mission in the colonies. &#8220;Woman is the most powerful of all influences in Africa as in Europe,&#8221; she wrote in 1846, the year after she founded a school for the instruction of indigenous Muslim girls.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Frenchwomans-Imperial-Story-Nineteenth-Century-Algeria/dp/0804784310/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8;qid=1412169839;sr=8-1;keywords=A+Frenchwoman%27s+Imperial+Story">A Frenchwoman&#8217;s Imperial Story: Madame Luce in Nineteenth-Century Algeria</a>, <a href="http://recherche.parisdescartes.fr/CERLIS/Equipe/Membres-statutaires/Rogers-Rebecca">Rebecca Rogers</a> (Stanford University Press, 2013), a Professor at the UniversitÃ© Paris Descartes and an expert in the history of the French educational system, lucidly explores Luce&#8217;s work in the field, bringing  a wealth of precise details&#8211; everything from what the lessons in the school room were like to prize-giving ceremonies and hygiene inspections. But Rogers also lets the reader in on the questions that remain about Luce&#8217;s own life.<br />
Rogers notes that while &#8220;EugÃ©nie Allix&#8217;s efforts to establish and finance her school have left ample traces in the colonial archives,&#8221; there are many details of her life that are not present and which can only be lightly sketched. For example, &#8220;[C]ivil registers offer tenuous insight into EugÃ©nie&#8217;s social network during her first decade of life in Algeria&#8221;&#8230; The circumstances of her second marriage &#8220;have left no trace in the archival record&#8221;&#8230; It&#8217;s an interesting meditation on the limitations of archives&#8211; how the story that is told of the life after is dependent upon the letters and signatures and red tape that the people of history have left behind them, as well as the moves the biographer must make to fill those gaps.<br />
So often the stories of women in history become the stories of all the men they knew and yet, in this case, the archive itself prevents that. As Rogers writes, the men in her life &#8220;[b]oth shaped her life in ways the biographer can only imagine&#8221; and yet the biographer is left to imagine precisely because the proof is not there. &#8220;She appears in the colonial archives as very much an independent woman,&#8221; which represents a rather refreshing reversal, almost as unique today as it would&#8217;ve been in the 19th century: a woman whose story stands solely on her work.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Tracking four women- two Confederates and two Unionists- across battle lines, continents and even, at times, genders, with great verve Abbott weaves together a series of stories, connected by the conflict in which they are occurring and yet also uniquely each women&#8217;s own.<br />
The story of the American Civil War has been told umpteen times, but it is an unexpected element within the familiar which Abbott is concerned with exploring here. Tales of our heroines- Belle Boyd, Emma Edmonds,Rose O&#8217;Neale Greenhow and Elizabeth Van Lew, all women most readers will be encountering for the first time- yield an untraditional perspective on women&#8217;s participation in the war whilst Abbott also gives fresh life to well-known figures: Stonewall Jackson, painted here in broad vivid colors, emerges from the familiar tapestry in his full, eccentric glory almost as a character born anew.<br />
Reviewing her first book, USA Today labeled Abbott a &#8220;pioneer of sizzle history.&#8221; It&#8217;s a label that&#8217;s stuck and one which is apt for a mode of story-telling driven by such a propulsive kinetic energy, as Abbott&#8217;s is. But it&#8217;s important to note that the stories she&#8217;s telling are sturdy, thoroughly researched and culturally necessary. The word &#8220;sizzle&#8221; can imply a frothy effervescence, a flash in the pan, and these stories- the stories of these four women in Liar, Temptress, Soldier, Spy and in her other books- are anything but.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For those who are savvy about all things psychoanalytic, be they analysts, analysands, or fellow travelers, the existence, presence, work, writing, and imprimatur of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Phillips_(psychologist)" target="_blank">Adam Phillips</a> is given long, as opposed to short, shrift. It is safe to say that his voice is singular in its mellifluousness and its range.<br />
I first encountered his writing at one of my dearest friend&#8217;s, and any second now new NBiP host and psychoanalyst Anne Wennerstrand&#8217;s wedding. Her husband, (doyen of the world of choreography), Doug Elkins, insisted I read a snippet from Phillip&#8217;s book, On Monogamy, before they slipped on their rings. This request placed the thinking of Phillips squarely into my casually bridesmaided lap. That Elkins, a dancer with what we then called &#8220;downtown&#8221; street credibility knew from Adam Phillips perhaps 15 years ago says something; and it says something about Phillips and his reach.<br />
In Phillips&#8217; most recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300158661/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Becoming Freud: The Making of a Psychoanalyst</a> (Yale UP, 2014), we encounter the biography of a man who thought the entire genre of biography was nothing but bunk. And yet, in this biography of Freud we also encounter a writer who seeks to show respect for Freud&#8217;s dis-ease if not utter disrespect for the attempt to write the story of his life. As such, the book illustrates Phillips&#8217; clinical acumen as much as his mind, his writing mien, and the life of his subject. Demonstrating great caution, going up to the lip of certain facts without speculating unduly, like a savvy but sensitive psychoanalyst, Phillips offers the world a book that, like a true tree of life, grows in many directions at once. As no doubt it will be read by people unfamiliar with &#8220;the talking cure&#8221; it carries a heavy burden in a day and age that prefers writing/texting/emailing to talking a deux, forget entering into an analysis!<br />
Embedded within the text we find a vast exploration of the difference between &#8220;telling one&#8217;s story&#8221; (on Oprah or in a blog as is de rigeur in the culture of confession du moment) and speaking in the analytic dyad. Ultimately, as compared with what real truths might be uttered in a psychoanalysis, indeed the facts of biography look paltry. And furthermore, as this is a book that plays hardball with commonplace conceptions of knowledge, data, and truth, as compared with the exploration of unruly desire and its vicissitudes, we find ourselves returned to Freud who told us that the truths we create for the public work well to hide the real thing, the kinds of archaic truths spoken solely within the confines of a psychoanalytic setting.<br />
Phillips brings back the primacy of the sexual to Freud, and hence to psychoanalysis. Bring on the alleluia chorus and enjoy the interview!!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sju.edu/about-sju/faculty-staff/faculty-experts/james-carter-phd" target="_blank">Jay Carter</a>&#8216;s new book follows the life of one man as a way of opening a window into the lived history of twentieth-century China. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199367590/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Heart of Buddha, Heart of China: The Life of Tanxu, a Twentieth-Century Monk </a>(Oxford University Press, 2011; paperback edition 2014) is less a traditional biography than a life of an emergent modern nation as told through the experiences of a single individual whose relationships embodied the history of that nation in flesh, bones, and blood. Born in 1875 as Wang Shouchun, the man who would become Tanxu worked various jobs as laborer, minor government official, fortune-teller, and pharmacist before finding his calling, leaving his family, and setting off on a journey to become a Buddhist monk. His travels spanned the physical and spiritual worlds &#8211; one of his earliest voyages took him beyond death to the underworld and back. After leaving home, Wang experienced treaty-ports in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese War, the Boxer uprising, and Russo-Japanese tension over Manchuria. His life unfolded in a series of Chinese cities that were administered by foreigners, and the transformative power of Sino-foreign relations in this period becomes a recurring trope throughout his story. Ranging north and south, he eventually studied to become a Buddhist monk and, as Tanxu, helped to found temples across China. Carter&#8217;s own travels took him from the Bronx (to meet with a Dharma heir disciple of the monk) through more than a dozen Chinese cities, taking Tanxu&#8217;s own memoir and itinerary as guidebook and route-map. The resulting book is a beautifully written, historiographically self-reflexive, and humane account of the lived history of modern China.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Originally, particularly in American writings, one of the explicit purpose of biography was to teach readers how to live. As Scott E. Caspar writes in Constructing American Lives (1999), in nineteenth-century America &#8220;biography remained the essential genre for creating American pantheons: collections of lives that represented the nation&#8217;s history, aimed to promote values or virtues or both.&#8221; This function, however, often flies under the radar. People read biography to learn about real lives; they may not be consciously paying all that much attention to the lessons they transmit.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0399530800/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">What Jackie Taught Us: Lessons from the Remarkable Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a> (Perigree paperback reprint, 2014), author <a href="http://www.tinaflaherty.com/index.htm" target="_blank">Tina Santi Flaherty</a> (philanthropist, businesswoman and former radio broadcaster) drops all pretense and explicitly mines the life of Jackie O- a life with which, 20 years after her death, many Americans still feel intimately familiar- to see what we can learn from it. The result isn&#8217;t a self help book so much as a book that shows how we instinctively use the stories of lives and integrate them into our own. It&#8217;s a provocative exercise.<br />
Re-released here to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of Onassis&#8217;s death, this version of What Jackie Taught Us includes a series of new essays that represent an important contribution to, not only Flaherty&#8217;s book, but also &#8220;Jackie studies&#8221; in general. It&#8217;s a treat to have the legacy of someone who&#8217;s so seldom considered seriously (so often she&#8217;s reduced to dresses and hats) reevaluated by the likes of Edna O&#8217;Brien, Allen Packwood, and Malacky McCourt. And Liz Smith&#8217;s preface is a downright gem.<br />
Twenty years after her death, we&#8217;re still curious about Jackie. From Flaherty&#8217;s book, we get some clues as to why.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s hard to overestimate the role of Raphael Lemkin in calling the world&#8217;s attention to the crime of genocide.  But for decades his name languished, as scholars and the broader public devoted their time and attention to other people and other things.<br />
In the past few years, this has changed.  We now have a greater understanding of Lemkin&#8217;s role in pushing the UN to write and pass the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.  Moreover, researchers have a newfound appreciation for the depth and insights of his research.  Genocide scholars talk about their field experiencing a &#8216;return to Lemkin&#8217;<br />
It seems an appropriate time, then, to reexamine Lemkin&#8217;s ideas and career. We&#8217;re doing so in a special, two-part series of interviews with scholars who have edited and published Lemkin&#8217;s writings.  Earlier this month, I posted an interview with Steve Jacobs, who carefully edited and annotated an edition of Lemkin&#8217;s writings about the history and nature of genocide, simply titled Lemkin on Genocide.<br />
This time, I talked with <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/alfred-deakin-research-institute/people.php?contact_id=629&amp;style=7" target="_blank">Donna-Lee Frieze</a>, who has meticulously edited Lemkin&#8217;s unpublished autobiography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300186967/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Totally Unofficial: The Autobiography of Raphael Lemkin</a> (Yale University Press, 2013).  The book gives us a new appreciation for Lemkin&#8217;s work.  It offers us a deeper insight into who he was and how he fit into his times.  And it shows how his experiences shaped his lifelong crusade to create an framework within international law that would protect persecuted ethnic and religious groups.<br />
One brief note about the sound.  We taped this interview in what was late winter in Wichita.  Bizarrely enough, New York that day was evidently much warmer than Wichita.  Donna accordingly taped this interview sitting next to an open window.  Occasionally, you can hear the passing traffic in the background.  If you&#8217;re not in New York, consider this local color.  If you are, feel free to brag that spring comes early in your town.  You don&#8217;t get that chance often.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Winner of the 2013 Samuel Johnson Prize, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Hughes-Hallett" target="_blank">Lucy Hughes-Hallett</a>&#8216;s biography of Gabriele d&#8217;Annunzio is a book with a big mission: to write inventively about the life of someone with whom most everyone outside of Italy is entirely unfamiliar whilst also promoting the literary legacy of a man celebrated within his own country and little translated (much less read) everywhere else. In the end, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307263932/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Gabriele d&#8217;Annunzio: Poet, Seducer, and Preacher of War</a> (Knopf, 2013) succeeds on both fronts, which is precisely why it remains one of the most lauded biographies of the last year.<br />
It&#8217;s not a straightforward day-by-day narrative. Rather, the story zooms in and out, taking flight and exuberantly soaring through whole weeks, months, years only to, at other moments, slow down to sensuously revel in the details of a weekend on the beach or an afternoon spent in bed. There&#8217;s something about this technique that beautifully mimics the ways in which we often reflect upon our own lives, with whole boring years blotted from memory whilst every single detail of a particularly haunting evening is eternally seared upon the brain. This is, I imagine, in large part why the book is such joy to read- because (at the risk of making sound simple something which very much isn&#8217;t) we&#8217;re reading the life of a flamboyant character written in much the same way we tend to think upon our own.<br />
d&#8217;Annunzio thought words, written well, could inflame nations and excite history and change the world. For him, writes Hughes-Hallett, &#8220;writing was a martial art.&#8221; Artistically, he was a poet, novelist, playwright and lover (the classification isn&#8217;t accidental- for d&#8217;Annunzio experienced love affairs as real relationships and literary creations), but also a soldier, flier, and politician. Those are the raw ingredients of his story. Superficially fascinating, to be sure, but it&#8217;s Hughes-Hallet&#8217;s mixing of them that so animates the biography of this short, bald man with narrow sloping shoulders and terrible teeth. And it&#8217;s the tensions that emerge through the telling that ensure that, even if you&#8217;ve never read a word of d&#8217;Annunzio&#8217;s poetry, his story sticks with you, which is a sign of an both a good book and an interesting life.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/jonathan-allen/" target="_blank">Jonathan Allen</a> and Amie Parnes are the co-authors of authors of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804136750/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton</a> (Crown Publishers 2014). Allen is White House bureau chief at Bloomberg; Parnes is White House correspondent for The Hill.<br />
This is a big, buzzy book that has gotten a lot of media attention. Much of the book is about how important trust is to Hillary Clinton. Allen and Parnes refer to the &#8220;concentric circles of trust&#8221; that dominate the political decisions made by the Clintons. They also write that Hillary Clinton has a &#8220;bias for action&#8221; that compels her to focus on doing rather than debating. One of the most interesting parts of the book is about how Secretary Clinton embraced technology and relied on staff to integrate technology into diplomacy innovative ways.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In America, biographies of Presidents and First Ladies are a staple of the genre, but the relationship that exists between the two receives surprisingly less exploration, as though the biographies needed to be kept as separate as the offices in the East and West Wings. (The relationship of the Clintons being the notable exception.) Hopefully <a href="http://www.willswift.com/">Will Swift</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451676948/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Pat and Dick: The Nixons, an Intimate Portrait of a Marriage</a> (Threshold Editions, 2014)) augurs a new biographical trend towards serious examination of presidential relationships.<br />
It&#8217;s a daunting task- to not only humanize but probe the relationship that existed between a pair still, fifty years on, more easily reduced to the stereotypes of &#8216;Tricky Dick&#8217; and &#8216;Plastic Pat&#8217;- but Swift gives a welcome corrective, portraying a surprisingly vulnerable Nixon whilst, perhaps even more importantly, providing a historically significant re-evaluation of his wife.<br />
For, of all the recent First Ladies, it&#8217;s Pat Nixon&#8217;s accomplishments that have been most overlooked, obscured as they were by a frosty public image and the downfall of her husband. In the public imagination, First Ladies are easily associated with social issues (Lady Bird Johnson and the environment, Michelle Obama and healthy eating, etc.), and yet Pat Nixon&#8217;s issue of  &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;- both important and, perhaps, overly broad and, therefore, more difficult to quantify- seems to have fallen from historical view.<br />
As Swift demonstrates, however, her volunteerism platform was a springboard in improving American international relations. When, after the Peruvian earthquake of May 1970, Pat Nixon made a harrowing journey into the heart of Peru, to an area then called &#8216;The Valley of Death&#8217;, where she assisted and comforted survivors. &#8216;To have President Nixon send his wife here means more to me than if he had sent the whole American Air Force,&#8217; said Peruvian President Velasco Alvarado. It&#8217;s a story that reveals the impact a First Lady can have, an impact that all to often goes unacknowledged, and an impact in whose preservation biography plays a key role.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The British Marxist economist Maurice Dobb is now largely forgotten. That&#8217;s too bad for a number of reasons. He was a brilliant thinker who wrote some of the most insightful analyses of the development and workings of capitalism around. You can still read his work and profit. He was the intellectual godfather of several notable British Marxist historians of the &#8220;New Left&#8221; of the 1960s and 1970s: Rodney Hilton, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson, among others. And, perhaps most importantly, his life gives us a window into a forgotten time, one in which a economists took communism seriously and fellows at Cambridge could earnestly believe in a bright communist future. This, I think, is a time we must not forget.<br />
Thanks to  <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/graduate/Shenk.html" target="_blank">Timothy Shenk</a>&#8216;s well-researched, readable biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137297018/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Maurice Dobb: Political Economist</a> (Palgrave-Macmillan, 2013), we won&#8217;t have to. Shenk tells Dobb&#8217;s tale in all its tortured complexity. A member of the establishment and an anti-establishmentarian. A dyed-in-the-wool Marxist and a deadly serious empirically-oriented economist. A supporter of the Soviet Union and a critic of Soviet power. Listen in.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In recent years, the jettisoning of this tradition has led to a number of compelling explorations of the lives of commodities (such as  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Salt-World-History-Mark-Kurlansky/dp/0142001619/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392209151&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=salt">salt</a>  or  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Banana-Fate-Fruit-Changed-World/dp/0452290082/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392209173&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=banana">the banana</a>), texts (<a href="http://newbooksinbiography.com/2012/05/15/ellen-f-brown-and-john-wiley-jr-margaret-mitchells-gone-with-the-wind-taylor-trade-publishing-2011/">Gone with the Wind</a>, for example), diseases (including  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392209362&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=cancer+biography">cancer</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Immortal-Life-Henrietta-Lacks/dp/1400052181/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392209450&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=immortal+life+of+henrietta+lacks">cancer cells</a>), and even the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Atlantic-Vast-Ocean-Million-Stories/dp/0007341393">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The latest entry into this realm of biographical inquiry is <a href="http://bobneer.com/">Robert Neer</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674073010/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Napalm: An American Biography</a> (Harvard University Press, 2013).<br />
As the title suggests, this is a consciously American biography, meaning that Neer (a core lecturer at <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/Neer.html">Columbia University</a>) traces the arc of the life of the incendiary gel whilst also situating it in a national context. Napalm is, after all, an American invention and, as Neer writes in the prologue, &#8220;It&#8217;s history illuminates America&#8217;s story, from victory in World War II, through defeat in Vietnam, to its current position in a globalizing world.&#8221; Much as napalm sticks to everything it encounters, so it sticks to our national history, splattering into the lives of those involved in its creation, the victims of its use, and the way America- to this day- wages war.<br />
*To briefly highlight another emerging biographical trend, many authors are now posting their research online so that it is easily accessible to readers.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Few historians have influenced their field the way that C. Vann Woodward (1908-99) changed the writing of southern history. First at Johns Hopkins and then at Yale, Woodward&#8217;s books, reviews, and mentoring turned southern history into one of the most dynamic fields of historical scholarship. These letters, edited by <a href="http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/directory/mo10003@cam.ac.uk" target="_blank">Michael O&#8217;Brien</a> of Jesus College, Cambridge University, follow Woodward from his early, hesitant steps into academia to his rise to the top of the historical establishment &#8212; an establishment whose moves toward multiculturalism and specialization he came to question. Woodward was a deeply private man, and while these letters focus on his professional life they nevertheless showcase the wit, humanity, and unselfishness for which he was renowned.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Alex Haley&#8217;s 1976 book Roots: The Saga of an American Family still stands as a memorable epic journey into the history of African Americans during the enslavement period and after. The 1977 televised miniseries was a must-watch event of the day, and it remains an important production in television history. However, a little more than a decade after his success, Haley was in trouble. His wealth had dwindled and he had strained relationships with other writers. What happened? <a href="http://adamhenig.com/" target="_blank">Adam Henig</a> tells us in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HRN891A/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Alex Haley&#8217;s Roots: An Author&#8217;s Odyssey</a> (2014).

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/ebrey/" target="_blank">Patricia Ebrey</a>&#8216;s beautifully written and exhaustively researched new book introduces readers to an emperor of China as artist, collector, father, ruler, scholar, patron, and human being. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674725255/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Emperor Huizong</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014) explores the person and the reign of the eighth emperor of the Song Dynasty, who ascended the Song throne in 1100 (at age 17) and ruled almost 26 years until 1125. Huizong is perhaps best known as a ruler who was so caught up in a sensual life (painting, calligraphy, Daoism, etc.) that he failed to properly govern and left the dynastic door open to invading Jurchen forces. Ebrey offers us a much more complex and even-handed account of this fascinating figure and his world, following the life and rule of Huizong in intricate detail to try to understand the circumstances that ultimately led this man to pretend to have a stroke so that his son could ascend the throne and try to succeed where the father had failed to avert a Jin takeover. (Both were unsuccessful, and as Jurchen forces sacked Kaifeng the remnants of the Song fled southward while Huizong and his son were taken into captivity.) We learn not only about Huizong&#8217;s childhood and family life, but also about his negotiation of reforms (political and musical) at court, his faith in and relationship to Daoism, and his practice and patronage of the arts of medicine, architecture, painting, and calligraphy. Ebrey brings a masterful reading of a diverse archive of sources to bear on creating this imperial portrait, which is both an incredible feat of careful scholarship and an absolute pleasure to read.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Everybody knows the author of The Jungle was Upton Sinclair (or, if they&#8217;re a little confused, they might say Sinclair Lewis). As <a href="http://laurencoodley.com/" target="_blank">Lauren Coodley</a> shows in her new biography  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803243820/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Upton Sinclair: California Socialist, Celebrity Intellectual</a> (University of Nebraska Press, 2013), there was a lot more to Upton Sinclair. For one thing, he was the author of nearly eighty books that were not entitled The Jungle. One of those, Dragon&#8217;s Teeth (part of the World&#8217;s End series), won him the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Sinclair was also a socialist, feminist, anti-communist, dietary reformer, and prohibitionist. And, as Coodley reminds us, he was a prominent celebrity, a born contrarian who took almost as much pleasure at defying his fellow socialists as he did infuriating the rich, powerful, and complacent.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s almost a clichÃ© by now to say that we need stories of strong women, but that doesn&#8217;t lessen the fact that we do. And biography is a field uniquely poised to transmit such stories- of compelling, complex and, at times, contradictory female characters- to a broad audience. Case in point: <a href="http://www.claremulley.com/home/" target="_blank">Clare Mulley</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250030323/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville</a> (St. Martin&#8217;s, 2013).<br />
Yes, she loved and had a number of love affairs but, as Mulley makes clear, the significance of Granville&#8217;s life isn&#8217;t that she was, to all appearances, pathologically alluring to men. Rather, her life is riveting- it has meaning in the present day- because she seems not to have craved men nearly so much as she craved adventure, challenging work that put her at great risk.<br />
This was not simply adventure for adventure&#8217;s sake either, but adventure in service to a greater good, especially that of her homeland of Poland. For all her efforts as a secret service agent during World War II were in aid of her country, which is, in part, why the British government seemed never quite to know what to do with her and why this brilliant, imaginative woman was left to constantly lobby for a greater, more challenging, role.<br />
&#8216;Intrepid&#8217; is perhaps the best word to describe Granville as Mulley portrays her here. She kicked off her career as a spy by infiltrating Poland from Hungary on skis. Another time, arrested by the Gestapo, she talked her way out of imprisonment. Still later, when her comrades were arrested by the Gestapo, she swooped into the local office, demanding and securing their release.<br />
For her bravery, she was awarded the George Medal, the OBE, and the Croix de Guerre but there was, sadly, little room in the world after the World Wars for a Polish, female spy, and Granville slid into reduced circumstances that culminated in a tragic end: murdered by an obsessive admirer at a hotel in South Kensington.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There is no one way to write a biography, nor should there be.<br />
It&#8217;s a statement that seems obvious enough and yet one which is still, to some degree, casually combative. For biography has long been a genre wherein story-telling is disproportionately devoted to cradle-to-grave narratives about the lives of white men. It&#8217;s also a field wherein there persists a notion that there are things one, as a biographer, is and is not at liberty to do. This is changing, yes, but slowly, so that when books come along that bring forth stories that aren&#8217;t told in the standard, stale way, they often come under critical fire. As such, <a href="http://www.neilmckennawriter.com/">Neil McKenna</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0571231918/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Fanny and Stella: The Young Men Who Shocked Victorian England</a> (Faber &amp; Faber, 2013) stands at the frontline, a staunch example of the histories that need to be told and what biography can be.<br />
Through meticulous research and lush, incisive prose, McKenna presents a gripping and startling account of the arrest and prosecution of two Victorian drag queens. It&#8217;s a deft performance that strikes a tricky balance, playfully re-creating the underworld of 19th century London and the colorful personalities who inhabited it, whilst simultaneously conveying the importance of what is at stake for the people involved and society at-large. Make no mistake, this is a serious book, but one which is nonetheless shot through with the joie de vivre and chutzpah characteristic of the charming Miss Fanny Park and Miss Stella Boulton themselves.<br />
For readers who believe biography can only be written in one particular way, Fanny &amp; Stella may induce an apoplectic fit. But, for those eager for innovation and displays of daring within the field, Fanny and Stella promises an exciting encounter with something alarming and bold and bright and new.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Erich Fromm, one of the most widely known psychoanalysts of the previous century, was involved in the exploration of spirituality throughout his life. His landmark book The Art of Loving, which sold more than six million copies worldwide, is seen as a popular handbook on how to relate to others and how to overcome the narcissism ingrained in every human being. In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231162588/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lives of Erich Fromm: Love&#8217;s Prophet</a> (Columbia University Press, 2013), Harvard professor <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~deanfac/bios/2007/Friedman07.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lawrence J. Friedman</a> explores the life of this towering figure of psychoanalytic thought, and his position in the humanistic movement, which he belonged to. He gives an overview of the religious thought Fromm was inspired by, from Judaism to the Old Testament to Buddhist philosophy. Fromm&#8217;s credo was that true spirituality is expressed in how we relate to others, and how to bring joy and peace to the global community. His plea that love will be the vehicle to realize one&#8217;s true purpose was the central message of his view on spirituality.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the field of children&#8217;s programming, few people- with the possible exception of Fred Rogers- are as beloved as Jim Henson, a contributor to Sesame Street and Saturday Night Live, but most famous for his creation of the Muppets. And yet, he&#8217;s remained an enigmatic figure in the years since his death. People remember the Muppets and they remember Jim, but they don&#8217;t know much about him.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345526112/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Jim Henson: The Biography</a> (Ballantine Books, 2013), by <a href="http://brianjayjones.com/">Brian Jay Jones</a> is thus an effort to correct that and to pin down the puppeteer: as a man, a husband, a father, and an innovator.<br />
For, with the passage of time, we&#8217;ve come to take the Muppets and their maker rather for granted. They&#8217;ve been around for over fifty years so it&#8217;s easy to forget they had to be invented. It&#8217;s equally easy to forget how ground-breaking an invention- along with Henson&#8217;s other innovations- they were. As Jerry Juhl, the first official employee of Muppet&#8217;s Inc., reminds us in Jim Henson:  &#8220;This guy was like a sailor who had studied the compass and found that there was a fifth direction in which one could sail.&#8221;<br />
And how doggedly he sailed. Henson worked relentlessly, not simply at a job but at his passions. As Jones notes, one of his top business objectives as to &#8220;work for the common good of all mankind.&#8221; And that is, in the end, perhaps one of the most striking things to emerge from Jim Henson: the fact that Henson was who he appeared to be. A complicated man, yes, with complications in his private life, but also a gentle soul who truly wanted to make the world a better place. And, also, a man who is, to this day, deeply beloved by all who knew and worked with him.<br />
Henson once wrote: &#8220;My hope still is to leave this world a little bit better for my being here.&#8221; As Jones&#8217;s biography proves, he did.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[John F. Kennedy remains one of the most remembered and most enigmatic presidents in American history, perhaps precisely because, as <a href="http://thurstonclarke.com/">Thurston Clarke</a> writes in the preface of his new biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JFKs-Last-Hundred-Days-Transformation/dp/159420425X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385061062&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=thurston+clarke">JFK&#8217;s Last Hundred Days: The Transformation of a Man and the Emergence of a Great President</a>, he was &#8220;more than most presidents&#8211; more than most middle aged men&#8230; a work in progress.&#8221; This is perhaps also why he&#8217;s a perennial favorite of biographers: because he proves such a challenge to pin down and because it is so very tempting to try to imagine who he might have become had he lived.<br />
Alas, he didn&#8217;t. And so we&#8217;re left to wonder, a temptation Clarke resists in JFK&#8217;s Last Hundred Days. Instead, he mines that period to see who JFK was then and leaves us to the imagining. For, undoubtedly, he was a changed man in many respects: grieving the death of his infant son, somewhat renewed in his commitment to his wife, moving towards a policy of dÃ©tente with Russia, re-examining American involvement in Vietnam.<br />
Clarke borrows from the journalist Laura Bergquist the idea of JFK as our most &#8220;prismatic&#8221; president, and systematically examines the various facets that were presented in his final hundred days. The end result is a portrayal that, while doing nothing to quell the unanswerable question of who JFK might have become had he not died, does go a long way towards answering the question of who he was while he lived.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For many people, the most important questions about the Kennedy assassination are &#8220;Who killed Kennedy?&#8221; and, if Lee Harvey Oswald did, &#8220;Was Oswald part of a conspiracy?&#8221; This is strange, because we know the answers to both questions: Oswald killed Kennedy and he did so alone. These facts won&#8217;t keep people from speculating&#8211;everyone loves a mystery&#8211;but they might allow us to focus on more pertinent questions about what happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas.<br />
One such question is this: &#8220;Why did Oswald do it?&#8221; Obviously, the answer will not be straightforward. Assassinating the President of the United States is, well, not really something a rational person would attempt, so we should not expect a completely rational explanation. Oswald was not crazy, but he was doubtless mentally ill. He had &#8220;reasons&#8221; for killing the president; it&#8217;s just that his &#8220;reasons&#8221; are not going to make much sense to us. To comprehend why he did what he did, then, we must comprehend how his &#8220;reasons&#8221; made sense to him.<br />
In his insightful, well-researched book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465021816/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Interloper: Lee Harvey Oswald Inside the Soviet Union</a> (Basic Books, 2013), <a href="http://www.petersavodnik.com/" target="_blank">Peter Savodnik</a> helps us do just this by investigating Oswald&#8217;s decision to defect to, live in, and ultimately abandon the Soviet Union. He convincingly argues that Oswald&#8217;s Soviet Period was part of a larger pattern, one that dominated his entire life: that of taking on and abandoning identities, always unsuccessfully. Even as a child (and, as Peter points out, Oswald had a horrific childhood), &#8220;Lee&#8221; never really &#8220;fit.&#8221; He could never find a group of people he could rely on, a social context in which he could thrive, a community that would respect him. As he matured, he began to search for an identity&#8211;in politics, in the Marines, and in the Soviet Union. Yet he was always, as Peter says, an &#8220;interloper&#8221;: he never lasted long in the skin of any given &#8220;Lee.&#8221;<br />
To this reader, the fact that Oswald was essentially an interloper goes a long way in explaining why he murdered Kennedy. It was his last attempt to fit in, to establish who he really was, to find an identity.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What do most Americans know about Andrew Jackson, apart from that he&#8217;s on the $20 bill and that he apparently had great hair? Probably not much. Maybe that he was a two-term president who pioneered the aggressive use of the powers of that office, and that he steadfastly opposed the sectionalizing, states-rights tendencies of the South Carolina nullifiers. In short, most of the conventional image of Andrew Jackson situates him firmly as an American. <a href="http://www.cumberland.edu/directory/cheathem_mark" target="_blank">Mark Cheathem</a>&#8216;s new biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807150983/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Andrew Jackson, Southerner </a>(Louisiana State University Press, 2013) reminds us that Jackson was born and raised in the South, became a wildly successful plantation owner there, and based his formidable political coalition in the American Southwest. Moreover, many of the signal events of Jackson&#8217;s presidency &#8212; Indian removal, the Eaton Affair (sometimes called the &#8220;Petticoat Affair&#8221;), and his war against the &#8220;Monster Bank&#8221; are only fully understandable when Jackson&#8217;s southern background is accounted for. Mark Cheathem&#8217;s book will ensure that we will never again take Jackson&#8217;s southern roots for granted.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The first comprehensive biography of famed Yiddish novelist, story writer and playwright Sholem Aleichem, <a href="http://iijs.columbia.edu/jeremydauber.php" target="_blank">Jeremy Dauber</a>&#8216;s welcome new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805242783/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Worlds of Sholem Aleichem: The Remarkable Life and Afterlife of the Man Who Created Tevye</a> (Schocken, 2013) offers readers an encounter with the great Yiddish author himself. Dauber writes in the rhythm of the language of Sholem Aleichem &#8211; Mr. How Do You Do &#8211; brilliantly structuring the book as a drama, with an overture, five acts, and an epilogue in ten scenes. He assumes the voice of a theater impresario, talking to his audience, just as the author Sholem Aleichem did, narrating his stories and reading them to the crowds whom he loved to entertain.<br />
The author Sholem Aleichem, most famous for his Tevye stories that became Fiddler on the Roof, was no Tevye, but rather a sophisticated and educated cosmopolitan businessman and writer.  He possessed immense curiosity about every man, a unique ear for interesting stories, and the ability to connect with his audience; these talents ultimately united his life with Tevye&#8217;s. Although he could very well write in Russian and Hebrew, ultimately he chose Yiddish, the most natural language of the people whom he loved, to tell his universal stories of tradition confronting modernity and the struggles of people to deal with change.<br />
Read this engaging and very well written book to learn more about Sholem Aleichem and fall in love with this man and his writings.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It is a struggle sometimes in biography to find new ways to write about subjects about whom many biographies have been written. This is particularly pronounced in the case of iconic figures of the 20th century (think: Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Onassis, Elvis Presley, F. Scott Fitzgerald), and an area in which the partial life biography can play an interesting role. Whereas biographers have more traditionally opted for what we call &#8220;cradle-to-grave&#8221; narratives, the partial life biography instead offers a slice of a life- a particular period that is explored in-depth. Such is the case with <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/authors/38208/Elizabeth_Winder/index.aspx" target="_blank">Elizabeth Winder</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062085492/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Pain, Parties, Work: Sylvia Plath in New York, Summer 1953</a>(Harper, 2013).<br />
Plath&#8217;s is a story most everyone knows, and yet her time working in New York as an intern in Mademoiselle has not previously been studied outside of the context of all that came after, which is surprising because it&#8217;s an interesting period but also because her experiences then formed the basis for what she would later write in The Bell Jar. The summer is of not just biographical interest, but literary significance as well.<br />
There is about Pain, Parties, Work an inevitable sense of clouds brewing- the summer will end, Plath will return home, and she will attempt suicide by taking pills and crawling under her mother&#8217;s house- but there&#8217;s also a sensation of joy: the joy of young women alone in a big city, experimenting with boys and clothes and make-up and work. Pain, Parties, Work is bolstered by the fact that Winder was able to secure interviews with many of Plath&#8217;s fellow interns, voices that have been notably absent in many of the earlier accounts and which lend an immediacy to a well-known story. The interviews with these women do much to flesh out the concrete details of the experience as well as Plath&#8217;s unique struggles within it.<br />
The Plath we have here is young and eager, fond of make-up and boys, and already displaying a rare gift for words. The clouds are on the horizon, yes- we all know that- but, in the meantime, the city and the thrill of discovery provide an intoxicating distraction. Summer is a time in which anything can happen. Reading Winder&#8217;s narrative and meeting Plath in this context, one feels that keenly: the excitement of a girl in the city, the hope and heat of New York, an electricity in the air.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Mikhail Lomonosov is a well known Russian figure. As poet, geographer, and physicist, Lomonosov enjoyed access to the best resources that 18th century Russia had to offer. As a result, his contributions to Russian arts and sciences were immeasurable. The source and shape of his celebrity, however, is as interesting as the man. In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1618111736/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Invention of Mikhail Lomonosov: A Russian National Myth </a>(Academic Studies Press, 2013),  <a href="http://www.northern.edu/cas/Pages/faculty.aspx" target="_blank">Steven Usitalo</a> constructs the great polymath not from the subject&#8217;s revolutionary work, but from the words of his biographers who transformed and lifted Lomonosov as a great scientific thinker embodying the Russian spirit. To Russians of the 19th century, Lomonosov helped represent the place of Russian sciences on the international stage. To the Russians of the USSR, Lomonosov represented the bold and forward spirit of the Russian people. Over the course of history, the great scientist and artist remains crucial to Russia&#8217;s memory&#8211;his actual work often distorted in the process. As Russia marked 300 years since his birth, the memory of Lomonosov still represents the interests of his admirers. The book masterfully demonstrates the power of national narrative and tradition in constructing history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One phenomenon of movies made of classic novels is that the movie often says a lot more about the time of its making than about the time of the novel. And so <a href="http://thegreatgatsby.warnerbros.com/">Baz Luhrmann&#8217;s The Great Gatsby</a> is more a depiction of a 2012 idea of the 1920s than a realistic depiction of the &#8217;20s themselves.<br />
But what of the &#8217;20s? These years are, today, so coated in mythology that they&#8217;re hard to imagine as a real time in which real people lived. The myths surrounding Fitzgerald and his novel are equally entrenched, but <a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/american-studies/People/academic/sarah+churchwell">Sarah Churchwell</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1844087662/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of the Great Gatsby</a> (Virago, 2013) goes a long way towards peeling back the layers that have accrued around all of this- the author, the novel and the time- to, in her words, &#8220;throw into relief aspects of the novel we no longer see.&#8221;<br />
Here, the world of the &#8217;20s- a world that so often seems impossibly ephemeral- assumes solidity through small details: hem lengths, traffic signals, the brightness of the lights. Churchwell&#8217;s aim may, at first, seem nebulous- to capture what was in the air whilst Fitzgerald was writing the book, the atmosphere, the mood- but, in the end, it yields a surprisingly concrete portrayal of the writing process (a notoriously nebulous thing) and the origins of a masterpiece.<br />
Careless People isn&#8217;t the life of an individual. Rather, it&#8217;s the early life of a work- a strand of biography that continues to provide fresh ways of considering classic works, the people who wrote them, the times from which they sprung, what they might have meant then and what they might mean now.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As you can read in any Russian history textbook, a series of seventeenth-century tsars culminating in Peter the Great attempted to &#8220;modernize&#8221; Russia. This is not false: the Romanovs did initiate a great wave of &#8220;Europeanizing&#8221; reforms. But it&#8217;s not exactly true either in the sense that they&#8211;the tsars themselves&#8211;didn&#8217;t generally do the work of Europeanizing reform because they knew next to nothing about Europe (Peter being something of an exception). In order to import and assimilate European institutions, the Russian elite needed, well, Europeans. In his fascinating book  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137323663/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Moderniser of Russia: Andrei Vinius, 1641-1716</a> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), <a href="http://history.usf.edu/faculty/cboterbloem/" target="_blank">Kees Boterbloem</a> explores the life of an on-the-ground reformer who was perfectly fit to do the tsars&#8217; reformist bidding&#8211;Andrei Vinius. He was not only European (Dutch, in fact), but he was also Russian (having been raised in Russia). Vinius was there at nearly every moment of top-down attempt to reform Muscovy. By investigating his life, however, we get to see the reform process from below. Just how was it done? Read Kees&#8217; terrific book and find out.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Christians in the United States and around the world have varying images of Jesus, from one who turns the other cheek to one who brings the sword. Reza Aslan, in his highly popular and beautifully written new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/140006922X/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth </a>(Random House, 2013), approaches Jesus by first taking the context in which he lived &#8211; first-century Palestine &#8211; quite seriously. Aslan argues that Jesus&#8217; time was one awash in a fervent nationalism that is important for understanding the man as well as his message. It is not a book about the Jesus of the Gospels. Indeed it is not even a book about Christianity. Rather, Aslan&#8217;s book attempts to grapple with how Jesus understood himself and his role during a volatile period in history. Zealot has shot to the best seller lists in recent weeks, partly due to a <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/is-this-the-most-embarrassing-interview-fox-news-has-ever-do">controversial interview</a> Reza Aslan gave to Fox News during which he was questioned about why a Muslim would be interested in writing a book about the founder of Christianity. We also talk to Reza about his earlier books, No god but God and How to Win a Cosmic War, as well as his two edited collections, Tablet &amp; Pen and Muslims and Jews in America. We talk to him about growing up Iranian, while pretending to be Mexican, in the United States during the 1980s, about graduate school, about Fox News and Islamophobia, and about writing for a popular audience, being a public intellectual, and the challenges involved with such endeavors.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Those questions are central to <a href="http://www.kzoo.edu/faculty/index.php?name=clewis" target="_blank">Charlene M.

They were quickly divorced at the emperor&#8217;s insistence, but her story does not end there. As  Boyer Lewis shows, this strong-willed and opinionated woman created a cult of celebrity around herself, centered on her self-conscious adoption of aristocratic ways. Her story illuminates the ambivalence about aristocracy, the scope of women&#8217;s action, the nature of fame and celebrity, and the complexities of father-daughter relationships in the early American republic.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The stories of individual lives are endlessly complex, weaving together the contemporary events, the surrounding culture, and incorporating random factual odds and ends. This is one of the challenges of writing biography- one must become expert on so many things- and also one of the pleasures of reading it: the fact that a biography can reveal something not simply about another person, but also provide an in-depth glimpse into other worlds. Such is the case with <a href="http://hss.fullerton.edu/history/facultypage/gbrunelle.asp" target="_blank">Gayle K. Brunelle </a>and <a href="http://www.odu.edu/directory/people/a/acroswhi" target="_blank">Annette Finley-Croswhite</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807145610/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Murder in the Metro: Laetitia Toureaux and the Cagoule in 1930s France </a>(Louisiana State University Press, 2013) which, in the course of exploring a grisly unsolved murder, immerses the reader in the 1930s Paris underworld.<br />
In 1937, Laetitia Toureaux was discovered in the first class car of ametrotrain with a 9-inch knife stuck in her neck. In Murder in the Metro, Brunelle and Finley-Croswhite untangle Toureaux&#8217;s complicated life&#8211;she was, at one time, simultaneously spying for the Italian government, the Paris police, and the French terrorist organization the Cagoule&#8211;in an effort to give a plausible explanation for how and why she might have died.<br />
However, their work extends beyond sleuthing; Murder in the Metrois a gripping story, but it&#8217;s also an effort to call scholarly attention to the use of terrorism during France&#8217;s Third Republic and, following World War II, the subsequent downplaying&#8211;even, at times, obfuscation&#8211;of such acts. Brunelle and Finley-Croswhite write that, in 1937, Toureaux&#8217;s life and death &#8220;offered a perfect tableau for the press to explore and expound upon the issues of gender and, to a lesser extent, class.&#8221; Today, she still acts as a tableau of sorts, her history merging with that of the Cagoule to provide a canvas from which scholars&#8211;with Brunelle and Finley-Croswhite leading the charge&#8211;can explore the nuances of the times in which she lived: a period marked by progress and innovation, but also violence and political unrest, all set against the clouds of a fast-approaching war.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Few history books sell better than biographies of Nazi leaders. They attract anyone even tangentially interested in World War Two or Nazi Germany.  It&#8217;s not surprising, then, that there are dozens of biographies of Himmler, Goering, and Hitler himself.<br />
Oddly, though, Reinhard Heydrich is relatively understudied. <a title="gerwarth home page" href="http://www.ucd.ie/warstudies/members/robertgerwarthdirector/" target="_blank"> Robert Gerwarth&#8217;s</a> wonderful new biography of Heydrich, titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300187726/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hitler&#8217;s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich</a> (Yale UP, 2012), fills this gap admirably.  Gerwarth&#8217;s book is part of a new wave of serious biographies that have appeared in the last years.  All are characterized by a thoughtful engagement with recent research on the Holocaust.  All devote considerable attention to their subjects&#8217; lives in the period before the Nazi takeover.  All emphasize the choices made by their subjects and the way these choices were not predetermined.  Hitler&#8217;s Hangman is an outstanding example of this new scholarship.<br />
Gerwarth&#8217;s work, in particular, is distinguished by its particularly effective writing.  He synthesizes a great deal of information gracefully, a demanding task in a biography this concise.  At the same time, he preserves space for anecdotes and details that illuminate his topic and add color to his narrative.<br />
Hitler&#8217;s Hangman has been widely praised by reviewers across the spectrum.  It is praise that is richly deserved.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The title says it all: Diana Vreeland was, in fact, that Empress of Fashion, reigning over Harper&#8217;s Bazaar, Vogue, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#8217;s Costume Institute for half a century. As a result, her life story stretches the conventions of biography, which so often presents mid-century women&#8217;s lives merely as a series of relationships. <a href="http://www.aitkenalexander.co.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;task=user&amp;id=768:amandamackenziestuart" target="_blank">Amanda MacKenzie Stuart</a>&#8216;s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061691747/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank"> Empress of Fashion: Diana Vreeland, A Life </a>(Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013) provides a stunning alternative: the work narrative.<br />
Vreeland&#8217;s is the story of an individual who, through sheer will, became the person she wanted to be. Today, we often read biography for inspiration and Vreeland herself searched for such in the lives she encountered and read, as Stuart writes: &#8220;At this point Diana wobbled back toward the idea of finding a great person on whom to model herself: &#8216;then by that I can become great.'&#8221; And yet she came up short, writing in her diary, &#8220;You know for years I am and always have been looking out for girls to idolize because they are things to look up to because they are perfect. Never have I discovered that girl or that woman. I shall be that girl.&#8221;<br />
Stuart&#8217;s portrait of Vreeland revolves around this notion that she, a woman who was not considered conventionally attractive, excelled in the world of beauty by virtue of this vision- this driving idea of being The Girl and showing readers how they might be their own version of The Girl as well. The element that separates the notion of The Girl from fashion journalism today is that The Girl was- at least in the beginning- attainable, more an attitude supplemented by seasonal accessories and small touches than a look defined by brand names.<br />
In the end, as Stuart mentions in our interview, Vreeland&#8217;s is a story of great hope: that one doesn&#8217;t have to a be a conventional beauty to be fashionable, one doesn&#8217;t have to be a man to produce exceptional work, one doesn&#8217;t have to conform to the lives and standards of others to be great. Simply by being herself, by being that girl she couldn&#8217;t find anywhere else, Vreeland became an icon. As a friend recalled: &#8220;She didn&#8217;t merely enter a room, she exhilarated it.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

After all, the framers had never seen a presidency before&#8211;almost all previous states were led by monarchs, and that was not an option for the new American Republic. So they looked at Washington, what he had done during the Revolutionary War, and modeled the presidency after him. Not surprisingly since Washington was a military man, they got a presidency that was, well, rather martial. Listen in and find out why.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

A lot, it turns out. <a href="http://www.michaelburlingame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Burlingame</a> has been researching the life and times of Abraham Lincoln during his entire career as a historian. As he explains in this interview, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421409739/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abraham Lincoln: A Life</a> (Paperback; Johns Hopkins University Press, 2013) is based on decades of archival research, much of it stemming from the observations of personal secretaries, journalists, colleagues, and other people who knew Abraham Lincoln personally. Burlingame does not hesitate to make bold assessments about Lincoln&#8217;s personality, his relationship with his wife and father, and his evolution as a war leader. Those interpretations, combined with new source materials and a highly readable style, will make this new biography the definitive one for Lincoln studies for years to come.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Nature or nurture? Inborn or learned? Genetic or extra-genetic? Humans are so complicated that in many cases we can&#8217;t really know what is &#8220;in us&#8221; from the beginning and what is &#8220;acquired&#8221; as we learn. And even when we find something that is &#8220;in us,&#8221; we can often find a way to modulate or mask it. Given all this, sometimes the best&#8211;and certainly most convincing&#8211;evidence that some trait is inborn rather than acquired is simple, honest testimony.<br />
Such is the case, I think, with homosexuality. In <a href="http://www.jonathanrauch.com/about.html" target="_blank">Jonathan Rauch</a>&#8216;s remarkable and moving memoir  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CLJAMII/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Denial: My 25 Years Without a Soul</a> (The Atlantic Books, 2013) the author explores exactly what it was like to deny his own sexual orientation for over two decades. Actually, &#8220;deny&#8221; is not really the right word, at least for what Rauch did in his early years. To &#8220;deny&#8221; is to realize the possibility of something and reject it. For much of his early life, Rauch never even entertained the idea he was gay, so he couldn&#8217;t very well deny it. It just wasn&#8217;t possible. He thought he was just weird.<br />
But as he matured, it did dawn on him that maybe, just maybe, he might be gay. Not surprisingly given the prejudice against homosexuality at the time he was growing up, the very possibility frightened him. He did not want to be gay. Who would want to be gay? Why would you put yourself through that? So he denied it. Until there came a time when he met kind, loving people who told him that he really should and could be who he was. They would help him. And they did. Jonathan Rauch then became what he had never really been&#8211;Jonathan Rauch.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s rare that a person&#8217;s name comes to represent an object, but such is the case with Lilly Pulitzer. Just say &#8216;Lilly&#8217; and it conjures images of simple sheath dresses in vivid colors. But what of Lilly Pulitzer herself? As Kathryn Livingston&#8217;s  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/047050160X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Lilly: Palm Beach, Tropical Glamour, and the Birth of a Fashion Legend</a> (Wiley, 2012) reveals, the woman was just as vivid as the dresses her name came to evoke.<br />
Born and married into privilege, Lilly Pulitzer wasn&#8217;t your typical debutante. She walked around Palm Beach barefoot and had a pet monkey. Boasting a similar background Jackie Kennedy and an extra shot of joie de vivre, she seems, from Livingston&#8217;s portrait, like a woman who would make excellent company at cocktail hour.<br />
She was also a bit of an entrepreneurial genius. Hoping to break out of a post-partum depression, Pulitzer opened an orange juice stand on Worth Avenue, selling juice to tourists and the Palm Beach hoi polloi, including the Kennedys. Ultimately, she would build an entire empire based solely upon the pattern for a simple sheath dress intended to hide orange juice and sweat stains.<br />
But, as the title suggests, Lilly is as much the story of Pulitzer as of Palm Beach itself. Unlike most residents, who were seasonal, the Pulitzers lived in Palm Beach year-round. Thus, Lilly&#8217;s story is one of both personal and local success.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Pretty much everyone who&#8217;s done a linguistics course has come across the name of Ferdinand de Saussure &#8211; a name that&#8217;s attached to such fundamentals as the distinction between synchrony and diachrony, and the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. Yet when it comes to the man behind the ideas, most people know much less. Who was this man &#8211; this aristocrat with a Calvinist upbringing who shook the foundations of the linguistic establishment, and whose influence was felt more strongly after his death than it ever was in life?<br />
When <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~josephj/" target="_blank">John Joseph</a> started looking into these questions, he found only scattered information. As a result, he ended up having to write the book that he himself had wanted to read. The result, <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~josephj/" target="_blank">Saussure</a> (OUP, 2012), is a detailed but nevertheless readable account of the life and works of one of the most respected figures in the history of linguistics.<br />
In this interview we discuss some of the questions that arise in connection with Saussure: his major intellectual influences, his remarkable lack of publications during his adult life, the originality (and historical antecedents) of some of his central ideas, and &#8220;Calvinist linguistics&#8221;.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Forty years after its debut, The Mary Tyler Moore Show remains one of the most beloved and successful television sitcoms of all time. But <a href="http://jenniferkarmstrong.com/">Jennifer Keishin Armstrong</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451659202/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted: And all the Brilliant Minds Who Made The Mary Tyler Moore Show a Classic </a>(Simon and Schuster, 2013) isn&#8217;t a simple episode recap. Rather, it&#8217;s a deep excavation of the show&#8217;s history from the perspective of the cast, the producers, a fan, and- perhaps most fascinating- the writers.<br />
You might ask, How is this biography? It is because, ultimately, Armstrong is writing about lives- the lives of the people involved in the show, the lives from which they pulled their material, and how their lives together, often haphazardly, to produce extraordinary TV.<br />
The Mary Tyler Moore Show depicted a woman&#8217;s work life, so it&#8217;s not too surprising that Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted does the same. However, the workplace that emerges is a revelation: with men recognizing the value of women&#8217;s stories and actively seeking women for the writing staff; with women writers mining their own lives for material and producing scripts that incorporate the everyday experiences of women, which were- at that time- seldom represented on TV.<br />
We remember The Mary Tyler Moore Show because it was well-crafted and funny. But, as Mary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted reminds us, the show came about in an environment that promoted equality and where the gifts of women were encouraged. Such environments are, sadly, still rare.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a reader, biography offers not simply an opportunity to read about the life of another, but also an invitation to ponder the choices that are available in life, the choices that comprise a life. Towards the end of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143122126/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Coco Chanel: An Intimate Life</a>(Penguin, 2011) biographer <a href="http://lisa-chaney.com/">Lisa Chaney </a>allows her subject to speak for herself. Chanel writes: &#8216;Today, alone in the sunshine and snow&#8230; I shall continue, without husband, without children, without grandchildren, without these delightful illusions&#8230; I am not a heroine. But I have chosen the person I wanted to be.&#8217; Chanel&#8217;s is a life that, all these years later, still reads as radical, which puts into perspective how terribly shocking it must have appeared in the early 20th century.<br />
Chaney has chosen an unusually challenging subject. Mired in myths, some of them of her own devising, the image of Chanel that has been passed down to us is clouded at best and, as Chaney acknowledges, quoting L.P. Hartley&#8217;s statement in The Go-Between, &#8216;The past is a foreign country. They do things differently there.&#8217;<br />
The story of Chanel&#8217;s life emerges in more muted tones than one might expect, with gray areas aplenty, from which it is unreasonable to demand clarity or place judgment.<br />
And yet Coco Chanel remains an uncompromising account. Chaney doesn&#8217;t ignore Chanel&#8217;s capacity for storytelling but, rather, explores the meanings of her stories, their unrealities, and the significance of the details that Chanel chose to omit. She doesn&#8217;t side-step the controversies surrounding Chanel&#8217;s life during the occupation of Paris, but instead grapples head-on with the moral ambiguities and compromises that occurred during the Occupation and in Vichy France.<br />
What emerges is an unflinching portrait of a complex, intelligent, unapologetic, incredibly hard working woman.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Dana Andrews was one of the major films stars of the 1940s, and yet he was never nominated for an Academy Award. The posterboy for the &#8216;male mask&#8217; archetype that typified the decade, Andrews portrayed the &#8216;masculine ideal of steely impassivity&#8217; in such classics as Laura and Fallen Angel. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1604735678/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hollywood Enigma: Dana Andrews</a>(University Press of Mississippi, 2012) biographer <a href="http://www.carlrollyson.com/">Carl Rollyson</a> cracks the mask, providing intimate insight into Andrews&#8217;s extraordinary talent and his life.<br />
Perhaps the most striking aspect of Rollyson&#8217;s account is that, in the end, Andrews appears to have been beloved by everyone. Often, biographies- particularly biographies of Hollywood stars- batter one&#8217;s affection for their subjects, illuminating horrible personality traits or an atrocious work ethic or a cruelty towards children, animals, and/or wives. Hollywood Enigma does no such thing. Rather, it tells the story of a man who, in Rollyson&#8217;s words, &#8216;always showed up for work on time, always knew his lines, and was never less than a gentleman.&#8217;<br />
That Hollywood Enigma is about a nice man doesn&#8217;t make it any less interesting. Origin stories in biographies are notoriously tedious- long lists of grandfather&#8217;s grandfather&#8217;s grandfather, like something out of Genesis- but Rollyson lays out Andrews&#8217;s story at a brisk and engaging pace. Born in rural Mississippi (a town with such an exquisite sense of humor that it christened itself &#8216;Don&#8217;t&#8217; solely so that its postal abbreviation might be &#8216;Don&#8217;t, Miss.&#8217;), he grew up in Texas then moved to California, where he worked as an accountant, a gas station attendant, and at various other odd jobs before an employer helped finance his lessons in opera. That, in turn, led to a gig at the community theater and, nine years after setting foot in L.A., Andrews appeared onscreen.<br />
Andrews would a remain a popular star through the 1940s, only to drift into B-movies in the 1950s and 1960s. But he would resurface in the 1970s, hitting upon something of a second act when he began publicly discussing his struggle with alcoholism. Andrews helped de-stigmatize alcoholism- a disease that was still taboo- while also reframing the way people thought about alcoholics.<br />
Hollywood Enigma is, ultimately, the story of a man who, in an industry known for its frivolity and excesses, stood out as an enigma precisely because he knew who he was.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The art salon is sadly less prevalent in our day than in days past, but it is far from obsolete. In its heyday, the salon provided people- particularly women Natalie Barney, orPerle Mesta)- with an extraordinary power to shape cultural tastes and contemporary art.<br />
In the early 20th century, Mabel Dodge Luhan&#8217;s salons in Florence and New York drew astonishing talents to her doorstep. Her gift for bringing artists together so they might collaborate and draw inspiration from one another played out even more grandly at the art colony she and her third husband founded in Taos, New Mexico. Over the years, they would play host to such luminaries as D.H. Lawrence, Ansel Adams, Willa Cather, and Georgia O&#8217;Keeffe.<br />
Though she&#8217;s remembered more for her gift for building artistic communities, Luhan was an artist in her own right. Her book Winter in Taos is considered a classic of New Mexican literature and her four-volume memoir vividly explores the changes in Victorian sexuality, politics, art, and culture as the modern age approached. However, despite their candor, the memoirs were not wholly forthcoming: Luhan&#8217;s writings about her struggles with depression, sexuality, and venereal disease were restricted at the behest of her family until the year 2000.<br />
In her excellent biography,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0826351190/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Suppressed Memoirs of Mabel Dodge Luhan: Sex, Syphilis, and Psychoanalysis in the Making of Modern American Culture</a> (University of New Mexico Press, 2012), Lois Rudnick- who has been studying Luhan&#8217;s life for over 35 years- explores these newly available documents, presenting Luhan&#8217;s writing alongside her own analysis, to draw new conclusions about Luhan&#8217;s life, loves, and work.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s a great advantage of a dual biography that one can draw attention to a significant life that might otherwise be unexamined by linking it to the life of someone famous. Such is the case with <a href="http://chipbishop.com">Chip Bishop</a>&#8216;s biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0762777540/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lion and the Journalist: The Unlikely Friendship of Theodore Roosevelt and Joseph Bucklin Bishop</a> (Lyons Press, 2011), which charts the simultaneous rise of the former President and the author&#8217;s own great-granduncle.<br />
The author does an excellent job illustrating the dynamics of the relationship between Roosevelt and Bishop. For it was to Bishop&#8217;s benefit to know Roosevelt, but it was also advantageous for Roosevelt to cultivate an ally in the press like Bishop. Theirs was a mutually beneficial relationship, and the author does an exceptional job of showing how it strengthened and altered with the passage of time, changes in status, increased physical distance, etc. These are the external forces that shape long-term friendships, but they&#8217;re seldom explored so intimately and eloquently in biographies of men.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0762777540/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lion and the Journalist </a>covers a lot of ground. There&#8217;s publishing, politics, PR, and the Panama Canal. It&#8217;s an unusual historical melange, but it&#8217;s riveting. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0762777540/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Lion and the Journalist</a> is also an especially rich entry into the genre of biographies about biographers and their subjects. For it was Bishop who penned the first biography of Roosevelt, laying the foundation from which all future biographers would begin.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I confess I knew nothing about Julia Child prior to reading <a href="http://bobspitz.com/">Bob Spitz</a>&#8216;s new book. And yet, from the dramatic opening passages through its 500+ pages, <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/171249/dearie-by-bob-spitz" target="_blank">Dearie: </a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307272222/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Remarkable Life of Julia Child</a> (Knopf, 2012) held me captive.<br />
How many people, much less women, change our attitudes, beliefs, and culture? Julia Child did. Perhaps even more impressive is the fact that she did so by becoming a television star at the age of 50.<br />
One of the problems of biography is that women&#8217;s lives are so often written so badly. Whereas the telling of men&#8217;s lives emphasizes adventure, in the lives of women biographers tend to emphasize relationships and romance. Not so Dearie.<br />
From the outset, Spitz contends that Child led a life of adventure and, while her relationships play a role in the story, they are not at its center. Rather, Child is the star from page 1. Thus, Dearie is an unconventional story of an unconventional woman who made unconventional decisions. Which is to say, biographically speaking, it is a breath of fresh air.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Her hand is held brazenly at her hip as her presence nearly obscures that of her husband, who hovers in the background like a specter. They are Edith and Newton Stokes.<br />
As biographer <a href="http://jeanzimmerman.com">Jean Zimmerman</a> details in her excellent duel biography of the couple, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0151014477/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Love, Fiercely: A Gilded Age Romance</a> (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012). &#8220;Both were progressives, and both believed in doing great deeds, whether it was reforming tenements in Newton&#8217;s case or getting the vote for women in Edith&#8217;s. They fell in love when they were children, a love that lasted until they were parted by death.&#8221;<br />
Edith eventually became President of the New York Kindergarten Association and of the Municipal Art Commission. Newton spent over a decade laboring on a six-volume history of the city entitled the Iconography of Manhattan.<br />
They were a couple defined by the city. Writes Zimmerman: &#8220;Edith and Newton were New York City to the bone. He, raised in an Italianate residence at Madison Avenue and 37th Street, which after his time there would become J. P. Morgans townhouse and then a celebrated museum of the arts. She, born a little farther afield, in still countrified Staten Island. They were in love and in Manhattan, which represents an unparalleled state of bliss. They led not so much independent as interdependent lives.&#8221;<br />
Love, Fiercely provides a fascinating and rich perspective on the rise of New York, the tensions of Gilded Age courtship, the evolving freedoms of women, and the shifting dynamics of a long marriage.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you&#8217;ve spent any time in New Orleans, you can appreciate the challenge of putting the city&#8217;s joie de vivre into words.However, as a New Orleans native, John Kennedy Toole was steeped in the traditions and flavor of his hometown and, therefore, uniquely qualified to write about it. His novel,  A Confederacy of Dunces, is considered one of the best ever written about New Orleans.<br />
As <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Typewriter-Kennedy-Remarkable-Confederacy/dp/0306820404">Cory MacLauchlin</a> writes in his new biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0306820404/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Butterfly in the Typewriter: The Tragic Life of John Kennedy Toole and the Remarkable Story of A Confederacy of Dunces</a> (Da Capo Press, 2012) &#8220;Toole selected, merged, refined, and wove characters together with all the absurdities that form the human condition. And there on the once blank sheet of paper in his private room in Puerto Rico emerged the city he had known all his life, his New Orleans.&#8221;<br />
MacLauchlin&#8217;s task is comparably challenging. He&#8217;s got an academic struggling to be a writer, a writer struggling to get published, and a man struggling to survive&#8230; and that&#8217;s just John Kennedy Toole! But MacLauchlin pulls it off. Deftly avoiding the problems that sometimes plague literary biography, Butterfly in the Typewriter is tightly written and populated with such memorable characters that it&#8217;s of interest even if one is unfamiliar with Toole&#8217;s work.<br />
Perhaps most impressive is the author&#8217;s unwillingness to dabble in speculation, a reticence that is increasingly rare and, as a biographer, sometimes taxing to maintain. As MacLauchlin writes: &#8220;In my pursuit to understand Toole, I neither aimed to diagnose him, nor cast him in the mold of tortured artist [&#8230;] I have sought to understand Toole on his own terms [&#8230;] to compose a biographical narrative in which Toole would recognize himself if he were alive to read it.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When I was in Seminary I was assigned many theological tomes to read and one was especially difficult to get through. It was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Systematic-Theology-3-Volume-Charles-Hodge/dp/1565634594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic Theolog</a>y by Charles Hodge. This work was dense, long, and I must confess, wound up mostly unread. So when I came across <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~engweb/faculty/profile_pGutjahr.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Paul Gutjahr</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019989552X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy</a> (Oxford University Press, 2011), I knew I had to find out why someone would write a biography about this man. It turns out there is much more to Hodge than I imagined. Dr. Gutjahr sets Charles Hodge in context and takes us through all of his 80 years letting us see into his family, friendships and battles. He concludes showing how Hodge is still influencing Christianity in America today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Texas poet/author/historian <a href="http://www.humanitiestexas.org/programs/speakers/presentations/dave-oliphant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Oliphant</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0916727955/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KD: A Jazz Biography</a> (Wings Press, 2012) is a poetic tribute to the life of Jazz trumpeter and one of the original Jazz Messengers, Kenny Dorham. Dorham, who played with some of the jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Art Blakey, Monk and many, many others, is less well known than many of his contemporaries, but Oliphant&#8217;s highly allusive and alliterative rhythms and rhymes open one&#8217;s ears, eyes and heart to the Texas-born and raised trumpet player. Oliphant describes Dorham&#8217;s small town roots:<br />
Ken&#8217;s prodigious ear at five years old<br /><br />
Could pick out keyboard boogies cold<br /><br />
&amp; from Sis&#8217;s 78s he could already tell<br /><br />
Louie on trumpet an equal of Gabriel<br />
Oliphant also describes touches on Dorham&#8217;s gigs and experiences in New York City, the West Coast, Paris, South America, Scandinavia, and his untimely death from kidney disease at the age of 48 in 1972.<br />
a brain filled with unseen notes heard<br /><br />
within his inner ears then out of tubes<br /><br />
&amp; a gold or silver bell the valve lubes<br /><br />
had speeded along Messengers&#8217; word<br />
a prophetic phrase blues or bossa beat<br /><br />
a chase or a smoky-toned running line<br /><br />
to blend with any instrument compete<br /><br />
with none but under the brothers&#8217; sign<br />
KD: A Jazz Biography is also a trove of takes on Dorham&#8217;s performances. Readers will find themselves downloading songs and comparing Oliphant&#8217;s insights with their own. There are also comparisons to Dorham&#8217;s trumpet player peers, in particular, Clifford Brown. For those who take pride in the diversity of their jazz libraries, this is a book that is as unique, original and dignified as Dorham himself. Oliphant weaves his own extended literary, historical, biologic, poetic, and popular culture knowledge into this extended poem about one of jazz&#8217;s lesser-known but nonetheless highly talented and original players.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you watched the U.S. broadcast of the London 2012 Olympic Games opening ceremony, you may have heard Matt Lauer and Bob Costas mention Jim Thorpe during Sweden&#8217;s entrance. Thorpe, arguably the best all-around athlete in U.S. history, won Olympic gold in both the pentathlon and the decathlon in the Stockholm 1912 games. But his victory was marred by a controversial International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruling that stripped him of his medals six months later.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803240899/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Native American Son: The Life and Sporting Legend of Jim Thorpe </a>(Bison Books, 2012), the first comprehensive biography of Thorpe, biographer <a href="http://www.katebuford.com/">Kate Buford</a> explores how Thorpe&#8217;s Native American heritage shaped his life, but also the impact Thorpe himself had upon American sports. Ultimately, he was the country&#8217;s first celebrity athlete, excelling at both baseball and football. His life was memorialized in a 1951 film and, in 1963, Thorpe was among the charter class inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<br />
Despite his other successes, the revocation of Jim Thorpe&#8217;s medals remains a source of contention for his admirers, <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/olympics/memo-to-ioc-just-do-the-right-thing-and-give-thorpe-his-due/article4428803/">Buford among them</a>.In 1982, the IOC approved the reinstatement of Thorpe&#8217;s medals and during London 2012, the Hammersmith tube station has been temporarily renamed in Thorpe&#8217;s honor. But, despite public outcry, the IOC still refuses to enter Thorpe&#8217;s scores into the official record of Olympic events.<br />
As Buford writes: &#8220;A gentle person, intelligent and funny, with many flaws, Jim Thorpe was not a complicated man. But what happened to him was.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The story of Wallis Simpson and the Duke of Windsor is more often than not presented as a great love story: she is the woman for whom the King gave up the throne. It&#8217;s precisely this oversimplification of the facts that <a href="http://annesebba.com/">Anne Sebba</a> seeks to correct in her excellent new biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250002966/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">That Woman: The Life of Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor</a> (St. Martin&#8217;s Press, 2012).<br />
The first woman to write a full biography of the Duchess, Sebba provides a much-needed rehabilitation of this polarizing figure. The bite of the title succinctly captures the bitterness and antipathy directed towards Wallis Simpson- during her life and after- but Sebba&#8217;s impeccable research illuminates a woman far more complex than the popular imagination has allowed. This is myth-busting to the nth degree.<br />
With access to previously undiscovered letters, Sebba creates an account of the Duchess&#8217;s life that is, at times, downright revelatory. For instance, Wallis Simpson didn&#8217;t intend to marry the Prince of Wales. Who knew?! As Sebba writes: &#8220;She was not in love with Edward himself but in love with the opulence, the lifestyle, the way doors opened for her, the way he made all her childish dreams come true. She was sure it was a fairytale that would end, but while it lasted she could not bring herself to end it herself.&#8221;<br />
Ultimately, this was the stuff of tragedy rather than fairytale, but the story is riveting nonetheless. &#8220;That Woman,&#8221; an American woman who captivated a Prince to the point of obsession. As Sebba writes: &#8220;Few who knew them well would describe what they shared as love.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As <a href="http://www.bu.edu/rs/people/faculty-staff/french/elizabeth-goldsmith/" target="_blank">Elizabeth Goldsmith</a> writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1586488899/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The King&#8217;s Mistresses: The Liberated Lives of Marie Mancini, Princess Colonna, and Her Sister Hortense, Duchess Mazarin</a> (PublicAffairs, 2012), the Mazarin sisters were &#8220;arguably the first media celebrities.&#8221; Upon their arrival at Louis XIV&#8217;s Court of Versailles, the sisters made a splash when Marie and the young King promptly fell in love. Ultimately, the couple&#8217;s relationship&#8211; which climaxed with a forced separation and Marie&#8217;s confinement in a convent&#8211; reads like something out of Shakespeare.<br />
Forced into advantageous mismatches that were, at turns, oppressive and abusive, the sisters jumped back into public view when Hortense, donning men&#8217;s clothing and making use of the new post coach service, left her husband and took to the road. Marie promptly joined her.<br />
At a time when it was borderline scandalous for women to travel unaccompanied by men, much less divorce them, the sisters darted about Europe, seeking refuge from the husbands who actively pursued them. The story of their escape seemed like something out of a novel and, for years, the whole of Europe was riveted. As Goldsmith writes, the sisters were &#8220;admired by libertines, feminists and free-thinkers but viewed by others as frivolous at best and threats to civil society at worst.&#8221;<br />
Both women penned memoirs, with that of Hortense being the first memoir written to which a woman signed her name. What is perhaps most striking about the sisters now is how brazenly unapologetic they were. As Hortense writes: &#8220;I know that a woman&#8217;s glory lies in her not giving rise to gossip, but one cannot always choose the kind of life one would like to lead.&#8221; She and her sister landed lives of adventure.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When it comes to writers and artists, biography plays a provocative role&#8211;yielding insight into both artistic influences and origins. This is especially true with the modernists, in particular T.S. Eliot. After graduating from Harvard University in 1910, the young Eliot spent a year in Paris, a year that had a lasting and profound effect upon his work that has gone largely unexamined until now.<br />
In her riveting intellectual biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813035538/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">T.S. Eliot&#8217;s Parisian Year</a>, <a href="http://library.msstate.edu/MSUauthors/ndh1/index.html">Nancy Duvall Hargrove</a>, the William L. Giles Distinguished Professor Emerita of English at Mississippi State University, revisits that single year in the poet&#8217;s life to mine it for later influences.<br />
While this period is often interpreted to be typical of the early 20th century post-graduate foreign study experience, Hargrove invites us view it as extra-ordinary. Linking Eliot&#8217;s work to the Ballets Russes, the music of Stravinsky and the intellectual tension ofLaNouvelle Revue Francaise, she demonstrates the rare coming together of an artist and the art of his time to form &#8220;un present parfait.&#8221;<br />
It was a year that influenced not only his poetry but also his prose. As Hargrove writes, the theater Eliot encountered while in Paris &#8220;may have been the inspiration for the difficult dramatic goal which Eliot later set for himself: to write verse drama in an age conditioned to prose and to write of spiritual and moral concerns in an age largely devoid of and unsympathetic to them.&#8221;<br />
But perhaps most impressive- especially to any lover of Paris- is Hargrove&#8217;s meticulous recreation of the city as it was then. Through chapters on sport, popular entertainment, transportation, etc., she elegantly situates the young poet amid a city so alive it seems to strain against the page. The end result is a book that leaves the reader longing for both the poetry and Paris.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The second-longest reigning British Monarch, Queen Elizabeth II has always remained an elusive figure, a monumental accomplishment given the media attention focused upon her family. In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400067898/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Elizabeth the Queen: The Life of a Modern Monarch </a>(Random House, 2012), <a href="http://www.sallybedellsmith.com/">Sally Bedell Smith</a> peels back the layers of mystique to reveal the very shy woman who is the current Queen. It isn&#8217;t so much a dismantling as a reevaluation, an effort to appreciate a figure who&#8211; though part of an institution that is seen by some as vestigial&#8211; is nonetheless deeply impressive and truly beloved.<br />
Smith interviewed over 200 people, 160 of whom are on the record as the queen&#8217;s relatives and friends&#8211;a fact that suggests that the 40 individuals who opted for anonymity are even grander higher ups. Though the book is not &#8220;authorized,&#8221; it carries significant clout. Buckingham Palace also offered Smith limited access to the Queen, so the author could see her subject in action and play witness to her quiet charm. That&#8217;s the biggest stamp of approval for which a royal writer can hope.<br />
Like many royal biographies, Elizabeth the Queen is filled with small, gossipy tidbits. We learn what the Queen eats for breakfast and what she carries in her ubiquitous handbag. But Smith also offers substantive insight into the less examined areas of the queen&#8217;s life, in particular her religious faith, her life pre-ascension and her relationship with the Queen Mother. The end result is a lively portrait of a hard-working woman who, in her own way, has represented &#8220;a new Elizabethan age.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Late in 1872, as the United States sought to clear the newly incorporated Southwest of its indigenous inhabitants, a company under Capt. James Burns came upon an encampment of Kwevkepayas (a branch of Yavapais) sheltering in the shadow of rock overhang above the Salt River Canyon. The soldiers wasted no time on the formalities of battle. They rained down fire, bullets ricocheting from the roof the cave, felling the refugees below. They even pushed down boulders. None survived.<br />
Well, almost none. A few days prior, the advancing soldiers had come across a young boy of eight or nine looking for a missing horse. &#8220;They made a rush for me,&#8221; Hoomothya would later write. &#8220;They pulled me over rocks and bushes. The men didn&#8217;t care whether I got hurt or not.&#8221; But unlike Burns&#8217; Kwevkepaya siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandfather, the invaders did not kill him. In fact, the man responsible for his family&#8217;s extermination would adopt the young Hoomothya as something between a son and a servant, renaming him Mike Burns.<br />
Over a century later, the prolific writer and editor <a title="Gregory McNamee" href="http://www.gregorymcnamee.com/" target="_blank">Gregory McNamee </a>has brought us Burns&#8217; remarkable story. In <a title="The Only One Living to Tell" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816501203/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Only One Living to Tell: The Autobiography of a Yavapai Indian </a>(University of Arizona Press, 2012), Burns recounts his survival of the massacre, his time as a scout for the U.S. military on the campaign against Geronimo, his education n white schools, and eventual reconnection with his Yavapai community. &#8220;Mike Burns lived in two worlds,&#8221; McNamee tell us, &#8220;and he was at home in neither.&#8221; But his intelligence, humor and compassion illuminates both in profound and unexpected ways.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In December of 2011, Oprah Winfrey appeared on The Dr. Oz Show to talk about her new big plans and her inspirations for the future. Oprah replied, &#8220;For me at this particular time in my life I recognize that everything is about moving closer to that which is God. And without a full, spiritual center &#8212; and I&#8217;m not talking about religion &#8212; I&#8217;m talking about without understanding the fullness from which you&#8217;ve come, you can&#8217;t really fulfill your supreme moment of destiny. And I think everybody has a supreme moment of destiny.&#8221; Oprah has been providing the path to achieve this (Aha!) moment for decades now through the rituals of contemporary consumer culture and spirituality that enable individuals to live their best life. <a href="http://www.yale.edu/religiousstudies/KathrynLofton.html">Kathryn Lofton</a>, Professor of Religion at Yale University, cleverly unravels Oprah&#8217;s story within the broader context of American religiosity and the academic study of religion in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520267524/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Oprah: The Gospel of an Icon </a>(University of California Press, 2011). In this excellent work, Lofton contends that modern religion is not something distinct that we can analyze but should be conceived of as the interaction of various modalities, which are often bracketed off as &#8220;Spirituality,&#8221; &#8220;Commodity,&#8221; and &#8220;Corporatism.&#8221; In our interview we explore various topics, weaving in and out of the content of the book, covering politics, public policy, ritual, capitalism, 9/11, among many others. We also had time to discuss <a href="http://freq.uenci.es/">freq.uenci.es</a>, a co-curated project funded by the Social Science Research Council, as well as the various reactions to the project from critics on <a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/tag/frequencies/">The Immanent Frame</a>. Lofton was a delight to talk to as you can tell from her engaging presence but for those who have not yet read the book be reassured that her personality and sharp insight shines throughout the text. It was a joy to read and there should be no wonder why she has received such a <a href="http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/the-gospel-of-an-icon/" target="_blank">wide response</a> by commentators.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Much ink has been spilled in telling the story of the making of Gone With the Wind&#8211; be it the book, the movie, or the subsequent musicals and merchandise. So it&#8217;s not only refreshing but downright commendable that in their biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1589796926/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Margaret Mitchell&#8217;s Gone With the Wind: A Bestseller&#8217;s Odyssey from Atlanta to Hollywood</a> (Taylor Trade Publishing, 2011), <a href="http://www.ellenfbrown.com/" target="_blank">Ellen F. Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Wiley/e/B003XQTZ8Q" target="_blank">John Wiley, Jr</a>. managed to stumble upon a story that has been almost entirely ignored until now. Rather than focusing the biography on an individual involved with Gone With the Wind, the authors explore the life of the novel itself, from its inception through to its future.<br />
What emerges from their narrative is a fascinating perspective on the life of a tremendously successful book&#8211; a story that&#8217;s equal parts legal thriller and manners drama, and peopled by a cast of colorful characters. We&#8217;ve flapper Peggy Mitchell, her stern husband, and her lawyer brother, whose Southern affability is put to the test by the slew of glitzy publishing people they encounter in New York, all of whom seem to bungle the novel&#8217;s publication in one way or another.<br />
Thanks to that bungling, the case of Gone With the Wind provides a crash course in the history of United States copyright law and that may be the enduring legacy of Brown and Wiley&#8217;s book. It leaves one with a renewed appreciation for the grit and determination of Miss. Mitchell- an oftimes undervalued literary figure, who fought viciously to retain her authorial rights around the world, during war-time and in an age long before email.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Nearly 50 years after his death, Malcolm X remains a controversial figure. An 8th grade dropout (he ditched school when a white teacher told him it was unrealistic for a black kid to dream of being a lawyer), he rose to prominence as the second most influential minister in the Nation of Islam, only to dramatically break with the Nation and convert to Sunni Islam the year before he was killed.<br />
As the nickname &#8220;Detroit Red&#8221;&#8211;gained during his hustling days in Harlem&#8211;implies, Malcolm X makes for a sneaky biographical subject. In the public imagination, he&#8217;s largely defined by The Autobiography of Malcolm X, written by Alex Haley and published shortly after his death. However, as the late Columbia University scholar <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_Marable" target="_blank">Manning Marable</a> reminds us in his ground-breaking biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143120328/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention</a> (Penguin, 2011), The Autobiography is a text and not a history. The Autobiography itself was a reinvention.<br />
The winner of the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for History, Malcolm X is an attempt to reshape the narrative of Malcolm X&#8217;s life and to prompt further investigation into the circumstances surrounding his death, but the book&#8217;s greatest contribution may turn out to be its portrayal of Malcolm himself. In contrast to the near messianic figure of The Autobiography, the Malcolm that emerges in Marable&#8217;s telling is profoundly flawed and hauntingly human.<br />
He is also vividly alive. &#8220;He lived the existence of an itinerant musician,&#8221; writes Marable, &#8220;traveling constantly from city to city, standing night after night on the stage, manipulating his melodic tenor voice as an instrument. He was consciously a performer, who presented himself as the vessel for conveying the anger and impatience the black masses felt.&#8221; The snappiness of Marable&#8217;s prose leaves one with the sensation that Malcolm X must&#8217;ve been standing over the author&#8217;s shoulder for the full twenty years it took him to write the book. Detroit Red&#8211; whistling, snapping, hustling, along.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Mention the name Bill Veeck to a baseball fan and what will likely come to mind is the back-and-white image of three-foot, seven-inch <a href="http://danthemantrivia.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/eddie-gaedel.jpg?w=580">Eddie Gaedel</a> at the plate of a Major League game, swimming in his St. Louis Browns uniform, the opposing catcher having just caught a pitch well over his head. Gaedel&#8217;s sole appearance for the Browns in 1951 is part of the lore of baseball, and it is often cited as the prime example of Veeck&#8217;s antics and his irreverence as a team owner.  As owner of the Browns, the Cleveland Indians, and the Chicago White Sox, as well as owner of the minor-league Milwaukee Brewers and executive for the Chicago Cubs, Veeck was famous&#8211;and infamous&#8211;for his promotions and publicity stunts. Veeck wanted to bring people to the ballpark, and he was willing to try any scheme to do that: giving away 100 dollar coins frozen in a block of ice, serving free breakfast cereal for morning games, inviting fans to bring their detested disco records for an on-field demolition, or sending a midget into a Major League game.<br />
<a href="http://www.pauldicksonbooks.com/" target="_blank">Paul Dickson</a>&#8216;s new biography of the owner, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802717780/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Bill Veeck: Baseball&#8217;s Greatest Maverick</a> (Walker &amp; Company, 2012), shows that there was far more to Veeck than Gaedel at the bat, Disco Demolition Night, or any other promotional stunt. Veeck had a genuine interest in serving his customers, in making a day at the ballpark an enjoyable experience for the whole family. The owners of the time judged his schemes as insults to the game. Even more than that, they resented Veeck&#8217;s willingness to mix with fans at the stadium gate and in the bleacher seats. Eventually, baseball&#8217;s owners came to recognize the wisdom of this so-called showman. The fan-friendly ballpark experience of today owes much to Bill Veeck&#8217;s innovations, from wider seats and widely available restrooms to specialty foods and promotional giveaways. At the very least, Veeck should be remembered for directing the renovations of Wrigley Field in 1936-37, a project that included building a brick wall in the outfield and planting ivy at its base (the Chinese Elms planted by the scoreboard didn&#8217;t survive the famous winds at the North Side park).<br />
But perhaps Veeck&#8217;s greatest legacy was his commitment to the integration of baseball. As Paul explains in the book and the interview, Veeck had a bold plan to introduce black players into the Major Leagues already in 1942. League officials, however, intervened to scuttle the plan. Five years later, just eleven weeks after Jackie Robinson first stepped onto the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Veeck signed Larry Doby to the Cleveland Indians, making him the first black player in the American League. The following year, he signed the legendary pitcher of the Negro Leagues, Satchel Paige. And in 1949, Cleveland had 11 black and Latino players in spring training as well as African Americans working in the front office, the stadium staff, and the grounds crew. Veeck was indeed a maverick and a showman, but he was also a man of principle and resolve. Not many owners of sports teams merit such a description. Nor could many owners be the subject of such an illuminating and entertaining biography.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There are three Americans in the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame. One is Horace Wilson, the professor of English who brought his students outside for a game in 1872, thus introducing baseball to Japan. Another is Wally Yonamine, the Hawaii-born Nisei who played professional baseball in Japan in the 1950s (after one season as a running back in the NFL), winning three batting titles and numerous selections to All-Star teams. And the third is Frank &#8220;Lefty&#8221; O&#8217;Doul. A power-hitting outfielder who won two National League batting titles, O&#8217;Doul was a member of two teams of American players who toured Japan in 1931 and 1934. O&#8217;Doul fell in love with Japan during these visits.  He returned to the country in 1935 to assist in the creation of the Tokyo Giants, a professional team that toured the United States. And he came back again in 1949, this time as the manager of the minor-league San Francisco Seals. With much of the country still in ruins from the war, the Seals&#8217; four-week tour lifted Japanese morale and helped repair Japanese-American relations.  Emperor Hirohito invited O&#8217;Doul to the palace to offer his personal thanks. General MacArthur called the Seals&#8217; tour &#8220;the best piece of diplomacy ever.&#8221;<br />
Lefty O&#8217;Doul is one of the principal characters of <a href="http://robfitts.com/" target="_blank">Rob Fitts</a>&#8216; history of the 1934 tour of Japan by Major League players. O&#8217;Doul was joined on the team of &#8220;All Americans&#8221; by future Hall-of-Famers Jimmie Foxx, Charlie Gehringer, and Lou Gehrig, as well as legendary manager Connie Mack. But the marquee attraction was Babe Ruth, at that time coming to the end of his playing career yet still the biggest star in baseball. Rob&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803229844/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Banzai Babe Ruth: Baseball, Espionage, and Assassination during the 1934 Tour of Japan</a> (University of Nebraska Press, 2012), shows that Ruth was also an international star. Japanese fans swarmed around him at every stop on the tour, and they cheered for his home runs, even when they were part of another lopsided win by the Americans. Japanese fans&#8217; admiration of Ruth and the other American players, and the overall success of the tour, convinced organizers that there was a place for professional baseball in Japan, alongside the well-established and popular high school and college leagues. Two years after the tour, Japan&#8217;s professional league played its inaugural season, featuring the Tokyo Giants and six other clubs.<br />
For his own part, Ruth came away from the tour with a great affection for Japan. He was then bitterly disappointed seven years later by the attack on Pearl Harbor. As Rob explains in his book and the interview, even during the weeks of the tour, when thousands of Japanese were cheering American players in the streets and stadiums, the forces that would lead to war were moving in society and the military. Babe Ruth and baseball were unable to keep that war from coming. But Lefty O&#8217;Doul and baseball were at least able to help repair the damage.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For years, biographers have been fascinated by the Mitfords, a quiet aristocratic British family with six beautiful daughters, nearly all of them famous for their controversial and stylish lives.<br />
There&#8217;s Nancy, the novelist who had a love affair with Charles de Gaulle&#8217;s Chief-of Staff; Pamela, the only sister who opted for a quiet life; Diana, the family beauty who married a Guinness then ditched him in favor of the founder of the British Union of Fascists; Unity, who had a crush on Hitler and unsuccessfully attempted to kill herself on the eve of World War II; Jessica, who eloped with a Communist at the age of 17; and Deborah, who married the Duke of Devonshire. In <a href="http://www.lesliebrodybooks.com/" target="_blank">Leslie Brody</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/158243767X/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Irrepressible </a>(Counterpoint Press, 2010), it&#8217;s Jessica Mitford&#8211;known throughout her life as Decca&#8211; who, at long last, has the chance to shine.<br />
She was a rebel almost from infancy. As Brody writes, &#8220;Soon after Jessica Mitford moved with her family to Swinbrook House in Oxfordshire, she began to plot her escape from it.&#8221; Her escape was spectacular, to be sure. As a teenager, she eloped with Winston Churchill&#8217;s nephew and ran off to the Spanish War. The couple eventually settled in America, where Mitford would remain after his death, later remarrying and becoming a journalist. Ultimately, she would be most famous for her expose of the American funeral industry, which was published in 1963 as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-American-Way-Death-Revisited/dp/0679771867" target="_blank">The American Way of Death</a>, but her work on civil rights and social justice was equally influential.<br />
Throughout Irrepressible, Brody includes direct quotes that let Mitford&#8217;s unique perspective shine through. And, as a white British woman with Communist leanings, Jessica Mitford provides a view of America- a country with an independent streak as fierce as her own- unlike that of any other. She was a &#8220;muckraker&#8221; in the truest and best sense of the word.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a whole, the genre of biography trends towards linear narratives&#8211;wherein the events of a subject&#8217;s life are tracked in the order that they occurred. This makes sense, as it&#8217;s how we live our lives, but there are advantages that come with non-linear structure. In the case of <a href="http://karenabbott.net/" target="_blank">Karen Abbott</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/081297851X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">American Rose: A Nation Laid Bare: The Life &amp; Times of Gypsy Rose Lee</a> (Random House, 2012), the benefit is that the book reads like a slick, sexy film noir and it is virtually impossible to put down.<br />
The life of Gypsy Rose Lee- &#8220;this Dorothy Parker in a G-string&#8221;, famous for her &#8220;burlesque of burlesque&#8221;- is perhaps best likened to a Greek drama. The relationship between Gypsy, her controlling mother and the younger sister who stole her name offers enough material for a whole master&#8217;s thesis on Freud, and that&#8217;s just one of the many tangled relationship dynamics here worthy of analysis. And yet, Abbott exercises masterful control over her colorful cast of characters, all while guiding three separate narrative strands.<br />
We enter the narrative at three distinct points and flip between them throughout: Gypsy, post-1939; Gypsy, pre-1939; and the Minsky Brothers burlesque clubs in the 1920s. If you&#8217;re not a biographile, the transitions might even slip by unnoticed, incrementally heightening the drama with each page until, at the book&#8217;s crescendo, you find you&#8217;re almost winded. American Rose is an ambitious story told in an ambitious style and, much like modern art, it looks effortless because it is impeccably well done.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Nearly twenty years after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, biographers are not only continuing to tell her story but finding provocative new ways to do so. In particular, a big bravo to <a title="William Kuhn" href="http://www.williamkuhn.com/">William Kuhn</a> for considering the former First Lady in a context that (a) has nothing to with her husbands, and (b) brings fresh perspective.<br />
Jackie&#8217;s post-&#8220;Camelot&#8221; years&#8211;namely, her marriage to Onassis and her publishing career&#8211;are often given short shrift, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307744655/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Reading Jackie: Her Autobiography in Books</a> (Anchor Books, 2011) steps in to fill the later gap and it&#8217;s downright revelatory.<br />
What we read reveals much about who we are. That&#8217;s the idea behind Reading Jackie and it seems simple enough. But, in viewing Jackie Onassis&#8217;s life through the lens of the books she edited, Kuhn produces something quite sophisticated- a nuanced portrait of a thwarted artist for whom reading was a vital means of participating in the art world. As Kuhn writes: &#8220;That sense early on of what she could not do was at the nub of Jackie&#8217;s self-image as a reader. Coupled with the sense of limitation was a determination to work around it, to participate in the creative and artistic activity that gripped her imagination.&#8221;<br />
It&#8217;s a daring approach and more than a little meta &#8211;to write a biography examining a series of books with the claim that they comprise the biographical subject&#8217;s autobiography&#8211; but Kuhn more than pulls it off. He clearly delights in both his subject and her work, and one leaves Reading Jackie not only with an appreciation of Jackie Onassis&#8217;s books, but also a renewed appreciation of her- this woman &#8220;who helped put enduring statements of why art matters into print.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Zellig Harris&#8217;s name is famous in linguistics primarily for his early work on transformational grammar and his influence on his most famous student, Noam Chomsky. However, much of his linguistic work has since fallen into comparative obscurity. Moreover, his political research and activism &#8211; about which he was especially guarded throughout his lifetime &#8211; has received scant attention.<br />
In this meticulously-researched biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0262015269/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Zellig Harris: From American Linguistics to Socialist Zionism</a> (MIT Press, 2011), <a href="http://sitemason.vanderbilt.edu/french_ital/barsky" target="_blank">Robert Barsky</a> casts a great deal more light upon Harris&#8217;s story. Exploring his involvement in the Avukah student group in the 1930s and 40s, Barsky shows how Harris not only strove to advance the cause of socialist Zionism, but also shaped the destinies of several influential thinkers. He also traces the course of the revolutionary programme of linguistic enquiry that Harris laid out, inspired by the example of theoretical physics, and how this ongoing work came to be regarded as eccentric by practitioners of the dominant contemporary research trends.<br />
In this interview, we discuss the utopian ideals of socialist Zionism, and the influence of Harris upon Chomsky&#8217;s political thought. We look at the contradictory facets of Zellig Harris as an individual. And we consider whether rationality is an unreasonable assumption, when it comes to inter-personal dynamics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Edith Piaf&#8217;s story is rife with drama. The daughter of an acrobat and a singer, she was the first French superstar and sang with wild abandon in a voice that rivaled Judy Garland&#8217;s.<br />
And yet, so often Piaf&#8217;s high-spirits are  used against her and her life is made to fit the standard template of the tortured artist: early ambition, a meteoric rise to fame, a string of meaningless love affairs and substance abuse leading to an early death.<br />
In light of this tendency,    <a href="http://www.carolynburke.com/" target="_blank">Carolyn Burke</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307268012/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">No Regrets: The Life of Edith Piaf   </a>(Knopf, 2011) serves as a much needed corrective, breathing life back into the chanteuse&#8217;s legacy. During her short life Piaf consistently demonstrated an extraordinary boldness- in her relationships, yes, but also in her singing, her spirituality, her artistic collaborations and her commitment to France during World War II.<br />
And the music! That voice!   &#8220;Non Je Ne Regrette Rien&#8221; seems to pulse beneath the text of Burke&#8217;s book and, reading it, one cannot help but be steered back to Piaf&#8217;s records. Burke was undoubtedly conscious of this as it&#8217;s where she got her title.<br />
&#8220;That kid Piaf tears your guts out.&#8221; So said Maurice Chevalier after hearing the 19-year-old newcomer sing in a Parisian nightclub. Nearly 50 years after death, as No Regrets proves, she still does.<br />
*No Regrets will be available in paperback on April 1, 2012, from <a href="http://www.ipgbook.com/no-regrets-products-9781613743928.php?page_id=21).">Chicago Review Press</a>.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Howard Cosell was fond of saying that American television in the 1970s was dominated by three C&#8217;s, representing each of the broadcast networks: revered CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, NBC&#8217;s late-night talk show host Johnny Carson, and Cosell himself, the marquee sports announcer for the ABC network.  Cosell was known for an inflated sense of self-importance, but in this claim he was accurate.  From his interviews of Muhammad Ali on Wide World of Sports in the Sixties, through his 13-year tenure in the broadcast booth of Monday Night Football, Cosell came to be the most prominent personality in sports television and one of the most recognizable figures&#8211;certainly, the most recognized voice&#8211;in all of American popular culture.<br />
Throughout his career, Cosell aspired to be more like the trusted journalist Cronkite than the entertainer Carson.  And one of the main points of historian John Bloom&#8217;s biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1558498370/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">There You Have It: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell </a>(University of Massachusetts Press, 2010), is that Cosell was an innovative, probing, and fearless reporter.  Cosell defended Ali when the boxer was stripped of his heavyweight title.  He spoke on behalf of Tommie Smith and John Carlos when they were sent home after their protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.  And he denounced boxing and refused to work in the sport again, after announcing the horribly one-sided Holmes-Cobb championship fight in 1982.<br />
At the same time, Cosell recognized that sports was entertainment.  He played his role for laughs in the Woody Allen film Bananas and on the made-for-TV &#8220;athletic competitions&#8221; of lesser actors and actresses.  But as his fame peaked, Cosell&#8217;s stated opinion of sports turned sharply and dismissively critical.  The broadcaster always felt himself an outsider in the world of sports, a characteristic that Bloom attributes to Cosell&#8217;s Jewish background.  And as a trained attorney, Cosell felt himself intellectually superior to the jocks and shills, as he called them.  He gained wealth and fame through sports, but he came to see himself as bigger than sports.  In that sense, Cosell can be seen not only as a legendary figure, but also as a tragic one.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I can&#8217;t remember when I first saw one of those horrible photographs of a lynching, with crowds of white people, kids included, laughing and pointing at the mangled black body hanging from a tree. I do know that such images were part of my childhood mental archive of atrocities, together with stacks of dead bodies in the liberated concentration camps and naked children running from napalm in Vietnam. Images like that made me a historian.<br />
But I didn&#8217;t have to live any of that history. Ida B. Wells did. A young journalist, she happened to be out of town when a game of marbles escalated into the lynching of three men who were pillars of the Memphis black community. She knew all of them; one was a close friend. Ida B. Wells was nobody&#8217;s fool &#8211; she&#8217;d already sued two train companies for denying her a seat in the &#8220;Ladies&#8217; Car&#8221; and she&#8217;d long written about racial injustice. But she wasn&#8217;t prepared for the viciousness of this lynching, or for the subsequent defamation of its victims in the white press. She published a strongly-worded editorial, moved north &#8211; after that editorial, there was a warrant on her life in the South &#8211; and became an internationally-known crusader against lynching.<br />
In her book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/080901646X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">To Tell the Truth Freely: The Life of Ida B. Wells </a>(Hill and Wang, 2009), historian <a href="http://history.rutgers.edu/faculty-directory/97-bay-mia" target="_blank">Mia Bay</a> takes us from Wells&#8217;s Reconstruction-era Mississippi childhood, through the anti-lynching work for which she&#8217;s best remembered, and on to her work for urban reform in Chicago during the Great Migration. Along the way we see struggles around race, class, and gender in American history: the linkage of sexual and racial terror in lynching, of course, but also questions about what it meant for a minimally-educated Black woman to be an activist. Mia Bay is associate professor of history and the associate director of the Center for Race and Ethnicity at Rutgers University. Read her book &#8211; you&#8217;ll be glad you did.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Few people can claim to have created a literary genre&#8230; Phillis Wheatley did. By the time she was twenty, her name- taken from the slave ship that carried her to America and the family that bought her upon arrival- would be known throughout the world.<br />
Extraordinarily well-educated for a woman of her time and place- much less a slave- Wheatley began writing poetry at a young age. The 1773 publication of her first book, entitled Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, brought her fame and, ultimately, freedom.<br />
Though she&#8217;s celebrated as the mother of African American literature and her poems are taught in schools to this day, Wheatley remains a shadowy figure. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0820333387/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Phillis Wheatley: Biography of a Genius in Bondage</a> (University of Georgia Press, 2011), <a title="Vincent Carretta" href="http://www.english.umd.edu/profiles/vcarretta" target="_blank">Vincent Carretta </a>lets the light in.<br />
It&#8217;s a daunting task. When one is writing about 18th people of African descent, sources are often scarce. But Carretta, a professor of English at the University of Maryland, rises to the challenge and painstakingly pieces together what is known about Wheatley&#8217;s life. In particular, Carretta illuminates how Wheatley&#8217;s evangelical Christianity was a subtle rebellion against slavery and also the means by which she got her words into print.<br />
The Phillis Wheatley that emerges in Biography of a Genius in Bondage is an alarmingly modern character- canny, innovative and determined to get her poems into print. That she was able to do so as a woman in the 18th century is impressive. That she was able to do so as a slave is extraordinary.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;When your grandmother gets raped, put it on the front page.&#8221; That was the Medill family editorial policy and Eleanor Medill &#8220;Cissy&#8221; Patterson embraced it enthusiastically. The granddaughter of the Chicago Tribune&#8216;s founder, the cousin of the Tribune&#8216;s editor and the sister of the founder of the New York Daily News, Patterson&#8217;s family were said to have ink in their veins and she was no exception. By the early 1930s, this titian-haired heiress was the only female editor of a U.S. major metropolitan daily.<br />
Patterson&#8217;s life held tremendous contrasts&#8211;great beauty, big scandals and bitter animosities and intrigue&#8211; all of which <a title="Amanda Smith" href="http://www.amandasmithbooks.com/" target="_blank">Amanda Smith</a> elegantly explores in <a title="Newspaper Titan" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0375411003/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Newspaper Titan: The Infamous Life and Monumental Times of Cissy Patterson </a>(Knopf, 2011). As the title indicates, there is no shortage of drama here.<br />
The heiress to a newspaper fortune, the young Cissy Patterson slinked through Gilded Age society, famous for her inimitable gait. Following the trend of Americans making socially advantageous marriages to European aristocrats, Patterson wed a Russian count who abused her and kidnapped their only child. It&#8217;s an incredible story given new life through Smith&#8217;s research, which uncovered sources that reveal how- through the intervention of Patterson&#8217;s family, President Taft and the Russian Czar- Patterson&#8217;s three-year-old daughter was finally returned home.<br />
As a society girl, a Countess, an essayist, a rancher, a novelist and, most memorably, a newspaperwoman, Cissy Patterson pushed the boundaries of what women of her time were expected to do and her newspaper was almost a mirror of her self. Under her leadership, the Washington Times (later the Washington Times-Herald) became DC&#8217;s most profitable paper thanks to Patterson&#8217;s gossipy editorials, her fierce isolationism and her distinctive editorial bite. There was venom in her pen and readers were hooked.<br />
It&#8217;s a testament to Smith&#8217;s skill as a writer that even the ancillary characters in Newspaper Titan seem to burst fully alive from the page, giving the reader insight not only into Patterson&#8217;s social circle but also an unusually keen sense of the personalities with whom she tussled.<br />
Ultimately, by Newspaper Titan&#8216;s end, the impression one gains of Cissy Patterson is that of a woman who prized newsprint over people, a woman who was delightful after a drink but whose claws came out after three. Patterson was the first to admit this. She was quoted telling TIME, &#8220;The trouble with me is that I am a vindictive old shanty-Irish bitch.&#8221; And yet, it&#8217;s that same cattiness that made her an influential force in the development of tabloid media then and which makes her such a beguiling biographical subject now. As Cissy Patterson herself said: &#8220;I&#8217;d rather raise hell than raise vegetables.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The integration of baseball is most often cast in terms of black and white, but biographer <a title="Burgos UI" href="http://www.history.illinois.edu/people/burgosjr" target="_blank">Adrian Burgos, Jr.</a>&#8212; a professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign&#8211; is out to change that. In his new biography, entitled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809094797/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Cuban Star: How One Negro-League Owner Changed the Face of Baseball</a> (Hill and Wang, 2011), Burgos explores the nuances of baseball&#8217;s color line through the story of the Negro League owner, Alex Pompez.<br />
The son of a Cuban father and a &#8220;mulatto&#8221; mother, Pompez, a black Latino, was an influential force in the integration of Negro League baseball and, by extension, the Major Leagues. Importing talent from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Mexico and the Dominican Republic for his Cuban Stars, he assembled the most racially diverse team within the Negro League.<br />
An outrageously successful entrepreneur, Pompez overcame the two primary problems facing Negro League owners: a lack of capital and a lack of stadiums. Using the money earned through his Harlem numbers racket, Pompez both financed the Cuban Stars and purchased the Dykeman Oval in which they played.<br />
As Burgos writes in Cuban Star, &#8220;Pompez was a trailblazer who over the span of seven decades&#8211;from his Negro League days through his major-league scouting work&#8211;opened pathways for talent from once-insignificant baseball territories.&#8221; In recognizing and importing Latin American talent and supporting players as they transitioned to life in the U.S., Pompez had a lasting impact on the face of major league baseball. His influence is still visible in the names gracing rosters today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;I&#8217;m sure if it wasn&#8217;t for Joe Louis,&#8221; acknowledged Jackie Robinson, &#8220;the color line in baseball would not have been broken for another ten years.&#8221; To Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis was an inspiration and an idol. &#8220;I just give lip service to being the greatest,&#8221; said Ali in 1981, after Louis&#8217; death. &#8220;He was the greatest.&#8221;<br />
Yet, while Jackie Robinson is now one of the most revered athletes in American history and Ali remains a cultural icon, the man who paved the way for both is lesser known today, more a distant folk hero than a historical figure whose accomplishments are understood and respected. Unlike Robinson, Louis was not the pioneering black athlete in his sport, and unlike Ali, he did not translate his success in the ring into a platform for larger media fame and political statements. Nevertheless, as <a href="http://www.cla.purdue.edu/history/directory/?p=Randy_Roberts">Randy Roberts</a> shows in his acclaimed biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300177631/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Joe Louis: Hard Times Man</a> (Yale University Press, new in paperback in February 2012), the heavyweight champion was an athlete without peer in his sport, one of the most talked-about celebrities of the day, and a man who did effect change, in some positive way, in white Americans&#8217; perceptions of black athletes. He was a symbolic figure of the Thirties and Forties and, as Randy argues, an essential character for understanding the history of that era.<br />
A distinguished professor of history at Purdue University, award-winning teacher, and author of books on Jack Dempsey, Jack Johnson, Charles Lindbergh, and John Wayne, Randy brings to the book an expert understanding of sports and celebrity in American history and a lively, arresting style. With attention to colorful detail and to the larger context of early 20th-century American history, he describes Joe Louis as a man of his times&#8211;and as a giant of the age. This is a story that certainly deserves retelling.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Forty-five years after her death, the reproductive rights activist Margaret Sanger remains a polarizing figure. Conservatives attack her social liberalism while liberals shy away from her perceived advocacy of eugenics and her supposed socialist tendencies. Though she was a pivotal 20th century figure, Sanger&#8217;s own voice has been drowned out by the cacophony of controversy.<br />
As renown feminist historian <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/author/jeanhbaker">Jean H. Baker</a> writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809094983/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion</a>, &#8220;She has been written out of history, thereby easily caricatured and denied the context required for any fair appraisal of her life and work.&#8221; In Margaret Sanger: A Life of Passion, Baker strips away the layers of myth and inaccuracy to reveal how truly radical Sanger&#8217;s ambitions were.<br />
A staunch advocate of the freedom and privacy of women, Sanger was determined that family planning must be seen as a basic human right. To that end, she opened clinics, challenged the obscenity laws and wrote explicit pamphlets on contraceptives. Undaunted by a stint in jail and constant bouts with the law, Sanger did everything in her power to help women take control of their reproductive lives.<br />
Baker&#8217;s portrait of Sanger is fascinating because it captures the broad sweep of Sanger&#8217;s ambitions for the movement, but also because it illustrates how, to an extraordinary degree, Sanger did precisely what she said she would do. In 1931, in her autobiography Sanger wrote: &#8220;I resolved that women should have the knowledge of contraception. I would tell the world what was going on in the lives of these poor women. I would be heard. No matter what it cost. I would be heard.&#8221; And she was.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Aside from being aesthetically equated to Elizabeth Taylor, Cleopatra has not fared well in history. In her riveting biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316001945/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Cleopatra: A Life</a> (Back Bay Books, 2011), which is now out in paperback, <a href="http://www.stacyschiff.com/">Stacy Schiff</a> establishes that this was primarily because Cleopatra&#8217;s story was penned by a crowd of Roman historians for whom &#8220;citing her sexual prowess was evidently less discomfiting than acknowledging her intellectual gifts.&#8221;<br />
Schiff exhibits no such discomfort and, in brilliant contrast, seems to revel in her subject&#8217;s lively intelligence. She establishes from the out-set that, above all, Cleopatra was a consummate politician&#8211;a visionary who shaped her own persona and her people&#8217;s perception through both exceptional leadership and canny political stagecraft.<br />
One of the most significant contributions of Cleopatra: A Life is that it provides us with the least tainted view of the Egyptian queen to date. Schiff assiduously teases out the motivations of Cleopatra&#8217;s chroniclers, and the result is a compelling rendering wherein the myths surrounding the last Egyptian queen are not only deconstructed but their origins are also explained. With the veils of myth removed, the Cleopatra that emerges in Schiff&#8217;s sensitive and probing portrait is a smarter, wiser woman, and one of the strongest, most influential rulers of the ancient world.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When it comes to Russia&#8217;s great reformers of the nineteenth century, Count Sergei Witte looms large. As a minster to both Alexander III and Nicholas II, Witte presided over some of the most important economic and political developments in the Old Regime&#8217;s last quarter century. As Finance Minister he oversaw the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway. As a diplomat, he was Russia&#8217;s chief negotiator of the Portsmouth Peace Treaty that ended his country&#8217;s disastrous war with Japan. As Prime Minister, Witte authored the October Manifesto which crowned a series of sweeping reforms of Russia&#8217;s political system with a parliament, the State Duma.<br />
But as <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/historydept/wcislo.html">Frank Wcislo</a> emphasizes in his biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199543569/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Tales of Imperial Russia: The Life and Times of Sergei Witte, 1849-1915</a> (Oxford University Press, 2011), Witte was also a great storyteller, as exemplified in his memoirs The Notes of Count Witte. Wcislo shows in this fascinating book how Witte&#8217;s stories reveal the times of the man as a man of the times. Witte was an archetypical New Russian torn by his affinity for the conservatism of the Russian elite and his recognition that those very values were fetters on his nation&#8217;s modernization. At the same time Witte&#8217;s stories reveal a man prone to masculine hero worship, gossip, vindictiveness, and embellishment of his own role in Russia&#8217;s high politics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When she emerged triumphant in a legal battle with the Texas beef industry, Oprah Winfrey took to the steps of the Amarillo court house and declared: &#8220;Free speech rocks!&#8221; She was likely a little less enthusiastic about the First Amendment following the publication of <a href="http://www.kittykelleywriter.com/" target="_blank">Kitty Kelley</a>&#8216;s unauthorized book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307394875/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Oprah: A Biography</a>,  which is now out in paperback.<br />
The match-up of the daytime television queen and the unauthorized biographer, Kitty Kelley, is one for the ages. The author of eight books&#8211; five of them New York Times number one bestsellers, all of them about living people and none of them authorized&#8211; Kelley has spent thirty years writing unflinchingly candid accounts of the most influential celebrities of our age. Even the <a title="&quot;CELEBRITY SMACKDOWN&quot;" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/04/19/100419crbo_books_collins?currentPage=all" target="_blank">New Yorker</a> allowed that &#8220;A Kitty Kelley biography of Oprah Winfrey is one of those King Kong vs. Godzilla events in celebrity culture.&#8221;<br />
With the help of over 800 interviews and four years of research, she provides an insightful analysis of Winfrey&#8217;s cultural significance, as an African-American woman and a survivor of sexual abuse. But, perhaps the biggest contribution of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307394875/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Oprah: A Biography</a> is that it picks away at the seemingly impenetrable persona Winfrey has presented and paints a nuanced portrait of a woman far more complicated, ambitious and interesting than the one seen on TV.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On November 10, 2009, Robert Enke stepped in front of an express train at a crossing in the German village of Eilvese. At age 32, Robert left behind a young family: he and his wife, Teresa, had just adopted a baby girl only six months earlier. And Robert was also at the top of his professional career.  He was the star goalkeeper for the club Hannover 96 of the Bundesliga, and he was expected to be the starting keeper for the German national team at the World Cup in South Africa. But despite this success, and the new addition to his family, Robert was unable to overcome a severe clinical depression that had gripped him for months. Only a small circle of family and friends knew of the depth of his illness. For others, both those who knew Robert personally and those who knew of him only as one of Germany&#8217;s best footballers, his death was an incomprehensible shock.<br />
<a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reng" target="_blank">Ronald Reng</a> was among those stunned by Robert Enke&#8217;s death.An award-winning German sports journalist based in Barcelona, Ronnie had meet Robert in 2002, when he was the standout keeper for the Portuguese side Benfica. The two men became friends when Robert moved to Barcelona months later, after signing with the city&#8217;s storied club. But Ronnie was never aware of his friend&#8217;s depression, and he was left to ask what could have drawn Robert, a man with seemingly everything to live for, to the belief that death was his only solution.  The answers unfolded in the research and writing of his biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0224091654/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">A Life Too Short: The Tragedy of Robert Enke</a> (Yellow Jersey Press, 2011).<br />
In writing his friend&#8217;s life story, Ronnie drew upon the diaries and letters of Robert and Teresa, interviews with Robert&#8217;s friends, family, teammates and coaches, and his own conversations with Robert over the years. As he explains in the interview, his aim was to tell Robert&#8217;s story from Robert&#8217;s own perspective.  In this, he succeeds.Readers gain a sense of the anxiety and anticipation as a football keeper tracks his opponents and then decides, in the space of a split-second, whether to leap or retreat. And readers also realize how debilitating and uncontrollable depression can be.  Robert did everything that is recommended to battle depression: he admitted his illness, sought medical help, took medications, and pushed himself out of bed to follow a structured routine.  Still, his thoughts remained black.<br />
Ronnie&#8217;s portrait of his friend is an extraordinary piece of writing, and the book was the deserving winner of the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/nov/28/ronald-reng-robert-enke-sport-book" target="_blank">William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award for 2011</a>. The story is indeed a tragedy.Robert Enke was, at once, a remarkably gifted athlete and also a pleasant and humble man.  Readers will like him, and root for him, and ache for him.  And I believe that those who pick up the book will hold the thought while reading, as I did: &#8220;I hope this ends differently that I know it does.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The public image of Kurt Vonnegut is that of a crusty, irascible old man.  Someone with whom one would want to drink, but never ever fall in love. The Vonnegut we meet in Charles J. Shields&#8217;s insightful new biography, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805086935/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">And So It Goes. Kurt Vonnegut: A Life</a> (Henry Holt, 2011), is much the same. However, in Shields&#8217;s capable hands, Vonnegut&#8217;s crustiness is cast in a new light, and his black humor is leavened by the humanist sensibilities it cloaked. With the icon stripped away, we&#8217;re left to confront a real human being, and a life that was provocative in ways one might not imagine.<br />
There are nearly 1,900 citations in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805086935/?tag=newbooinhis-20">And So It Goes</a>, a fact that belies the book&#8217;s incredible readability. As <a title="New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/books/charles-j-shieldss-and-so-it-goes-on-vonnegut-review.html?_r=1" target="_blank">a rave review in </a><a title="&quot;And So It Goes&quot;- New York Times" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/books/charles-j-shieldss-and-so-it-goes-on-vonnegut-review.html?_r=1" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> noted, this is not a stodgy affair, but &#8220;an incisive, gossipy page-turner of a biography.&#8221; Shields eloquently tracks the soap operatic elements in the iconoclastic writer&#8217;s life, while also offering acute analysis on his private self and celebrity persona.<br />
And So It Goes is full of memorable snapshots, but my favorite is this: &#8220;At home, [Kurt] secretly pored over an unabridged dictionary from his parents&#8217; large library because he &#8216;suspected that there were dirty words hidden in there&#8217; and puzzled over illustrations of the &#8216;trammel wheel, the arbalest, and the dugong.'&#8221; You can just see him&#8211;the man who bucked twentieth-century literary tradition&#8211;a curly-haired kid, canvassing the dictionary for words that were forbidden.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I vividly recall a time in my life&#8211;especially my late teens and early twenties&#8211;when I thought I could be anyone but had no idea which anyone to be. For this I blame (or credit) my liberal arts education, which convinced me that there was really nothing I couldn&#8217;t master but gave me little or no indication of what I should do (beyond platitudes like &#8220;discover myself&#8221; and &#8220;do good&#8221;). So I thrashed about, armed with an ounce of knowledge and a ton of arrogance. I was insufferable. I won&#8217;t go into details, but let me just say my quest to discover who I was ended rather badly, albeit not in the long term. Life taught me what my liberal arts education couldn&#8217;t: that I was who I was and not much more.<br />
Having read <a href="http://www.rosamundbartlett.com/Rosamund_Bartlett/Home.html" target="_blank">Rosamund Bartlett</a>&#8216;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0151014388/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Tolstoy: A Russia Life</a> (Houghton Mifflin, 2011), I&#8217;m left wondering if Tolstoy ever came to this realization. Throughout his life, he searched for his true self. His launching pad was not a liberal arts education, but rather an aristocratic background, a flock of tutors, and a remarkable talent. The first taught Tolstoy that he could do anything he wanted (which was largely true as it concerned the serfs that Tolstoy&#8217;s family owned); the second gave him the cultural tools he needed to conduct his search; and the third gave him the ability to rise above all the other Russian aristocrats who were trying to figure out what they should do and where Russia should go. Tolstoy tried on Russian identities the way you try on cloths at a department store. He was, by turns, a student, a slacker, an enfant terrible, a rake, a soldier, a pianist, a slave master, a gambler, a journalist, a teacher, a bee-keeper, a patriarch, a national poet, a peasant, a pundit, and a child-of-nature. At the end of his life he became a holy fool, or monk, or cult leader&#8211;take your pick. Some see this identity as his final destination, his moment of Buddha-like enlightenment. I don&#8217;t think so. Had he lived another five years he would have become someone else. Tolstoy&#8211;perpetual adolescent.Thankfully for us, the common thread in his loosely woven life was writing. He was a always a writer, and one with preternatural descriptive and dramatic gifts.<br />
Rosamund Bartlett is also a writer with considerable gifts, which explains why her grasp of Tolstoy is so solid and why her ability to vividly portray him so great.  If you want to know Tolstoy, read Bartlett.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Many scholars consider August Wilson to be the premier American playwright of the 20th Century. <a href="http://as17.as.uky.edu/academics/departments_programs/English/English/Faculty/Faculty/AlanNadel/Pages/default.aspx">Alan Nadel</a> is surely one of their number. In the early 1990s, he focused our attention on Wilson&#8217;s plays in the outstanding collection of essays <a href="http://www.uiowapress.org/books/pre-2002/nadmayall.htm">May All Your Fences Have Gates: Essays on the Drama of August Wilson</a> (University of Iowa Press, 1993). Since the publication of that work, Wilson completed his magnum opus&#8211;a ten-play cycle&#8211;shortly before his death in 2005. So now Nadel has followed up his first essay collection on Wilson with a second: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1587298759/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">August Wilson: Completing the Twentieth-Century Cy</a>cle (University of Iowa Press, 2010). This volume, as Nadel asserts, is for the trained cultural critic and everyday reader. My opinion is that the volume, like the first one, is centrally important to literary critics, performance scholars, and your average serious theatre goer, as well as to anyone interested in 20th-Century American culture. Listen to the interview, read the book, and share your thoughts.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What is the role of personality in shaping history? Shortly before the beginning of the First World War, the German sociologist Max Weber puzzled over this question. He was sure that there was a kind of authority that drew strength from character itself. He called this authority &#8220;charismatic,&#8221; a type of legitimate political power that rested &#8220;on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual person, and of the normative patterns or order revealed or ordained by him.&#8221; The charismatic leader is not like us. In fact, he is not like anyone. He is sui generis, a mysterious force of nature, a sort of political demiurge.<br />
According to <a href="http://www.history.upenn.edu/faculty/steinberg.shtml">Jonathan Steinberg</a>, Weber may well have had Otto von Bismarck in mind when he defined charismatic authority. In his wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199782520/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Bismarck: A Life</a> (Oxford UP, 2011), Steinberg argues that Bismarck&#8217;s successes (and some of his failures) can be largely attributed to the awesome force of his personality. Not &#8220;social structures.&#8221; Not &#8220;historical patterns.&#8221; Not &#8220;underlying forces.&#8221; But charisma pure and simple. Time and again Steinberg finds those around Bismarck attesting to the fact that he just wasn&#8217;t like everyone else. He was smarter, wittier, stronger, more willful, more cunning, more temperamental, and in most ways larger than life. And this was the nearly uniform (though not always positive) assessment of the some of the most impressive figures of his day. It&#8217;s a compelling case.<br />
And it provokes a question about German political culture, for Bismarck was not the first or the last &#8220;genius&#8221; to rule some or all of the Reich. Fredrick the Great preceded him, and Hitler followed. What are we to make of that? I&#8217;ll leave it to you to decide.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The Peabodys were key players in the founding of the Transcendentalist movement in the early to mid 19th century. Elizabeth, the oldest, was intellectually precocious, learning Hebrew as a child so she could read the Old Testament. Mary was the middle sister, somewhat subdued by the dominant &#8211; and bossy &#8211; qualities of Elizabeth, and by the attention paid to the youngest, Sophia, who was practically an invalid. Nonetheless, Mary managed to become a teacher, writer and reformer. Sophia, beset by devastating migraines, spent most of her early years in bed. But when she had the strength, she painted. In an interview with ThoughtCast, Megan Marshall continues the tale&#8230;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

An ardent abolitionist and reformer, Lowell was also a brilliant battlefield strategist, and he turned the tide at the Battle of Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley, a crucial victory for the North just two weeks shy of Lincoln&#8217;s re-election.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.cooper.edu/humanities/bio_binstock.html">Ben Binstock</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415966647/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Vermeer&#8217;s Family Secrets: Genius, Discovery, and the Unknown Apprentice </a>(Routledge, 2009) is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read. It does what all good history books should do&#8211;tell you something you thought you knew but in fact don&#8217;t&#8211;but it does it ON EVERY PAGE. I thought Vermeer was X; now I know he was Y. I thought Vermeer was influenced by X; now I understand he was influenced by Y; I thought Vermeer painted X; now I realize he painted Y. I could go on and on, revelation after revelation. The biggest news&#8211;or rather the bit that will get the most press&#8211;is that a handful of &#8220;Vermeers&#8221; were in fact painted by his daughter, Maria. Vermeer&#8217;s Family Secrets is remarkably well researched and convincingly argued. It&#8217;s also lavishly illustrated. So are a lot of art history books. But this one is also intelligently illustrated: the way the pictures are arrayed serves the book&#8217;s many arguments. They are not simply eye-candy; they are also brain-candy. And the book is written in a clever, engaging, dry style. The short &#8220;Acknowledgments and Preface&#8221; are worth the price of admission. A word about that price. I confess I get all the books I do on this show free, thanks to the publishers. So I don&#8217;t know how much they cost. I thought this one, judging by the production value, was going to run somewhere around $100. That&#8217;s steep. But my friends, I&#8217;m delighted to tell you that you can buy this book for the low, low price of $32.85 from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vermeers-Family-Secrets-Discovery-Apprentice/dp/0415966647/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1225996965&amp;sr=8-1">Amazon</a>. It would make a great holiday gift. Since I have a copy on hand, I think I&#8217;ll give it to my brother-in-law (don&#8217;t tell him&#8230;).<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When you think of the Great Terror, Stalin immediately comes to mind, and rightly so.But what of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNikolai_Yezhov&amp;rct=j&amp;q=ezhov&amp;ei=w6FkTdnyK8O88gaGkcjQBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEutFu7iwNUrz8dwhCzR_TRr7vaUg&amp;sig2=mVtbm81ZAxwogtT3ZgtVsQ&amp;cad=rja">Nikolai Ezhov</a>, the man who as head of the NKVD prosecuted Stalin reign of terror? We&#8217;ve learned a lot about Ezhov&#8217;s involvement in the Terror since the opening of Soviet archives in 1991. We know about his fanaticism, how he manufactured confessions, was present at his victims&#8217; torture, and even kept the bullets that killed his victims, wrapped and labeled them, and tucked them in his desk.  Less is known about Ezhov before he became the personification of Stalinist political violence.<br />
To understand Ezhov&#8217;s life before the Terror, we have to turn to <a href="http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=651">J. Arch Getty&#8217;s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300092059/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Ezhov: The Rise of Stalin&#8217;s Iron Fist </a>(Yale UP, 2008). Getty&#8217;s focus isn&#8217;t on Ezhov, Stalin&#8217;s &#8220;iron fist,&#8221; but on Ezhov the &#8220;good party worker.&#8221; In particular, Getty is interested in Ezhov&#8217;s meteoric rise through the Party ranks to become the head of the NKVD and, by 1936, the second most powerful person in the Soviet Union. Ezhov&#8217;s story is a mixture of hard work and ambition, patrons and clients, devotion, and Manichean political culture in post-revolutionary Russia. How did Ezhov successfully navigate all this?  The answer to this question says less about Ezhov as an individual than it does about the Soviet system in the 1920s and 1930s.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The term &#8220;totalitarian&#8221; is useful as it well describes the aspirations of polities such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (at least under Stalin). Yet it can also be misleading, for it suggests that totalitarian ambitions were in fact achieved. But they were not, as we can see in <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/caepstein">Catherine Epstein&#8217;s</a> remarkably detailed, thoroughly researched, and clearly presented <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019954641X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland</a> (Oxford UP, 2010).<br />
Greiser was a totalitarian if ever there were one. He believed in the Nazi cause with his heart and soul. He wanted to create a new Germany, and indeed a new Europe dominated by Germans. As the Gauleiter of Wartheland (an area of Western Poland annexed to the Reich), he was given the opportunity to help realize the Nazi nightmare in the conquered Eastern territories. But, as Epstein shows, he was often hindered both by his own personality and the chaos that characterized Nazi occupation of the East. Grieser emerges from Epstein&#8217;s book as someone who wanted to be a &#8220;model Nazi,&#8221; but couldn&#8217;t really manage it because he was a crooked timber working in a crooked system. His personal life was an embarrassing tangle of marriages, affairs, and break-ups that at points threatened his career. His professional life was marked by ambition, ego-mania, and fawning, none of which endeared him to most of his colleagues and superiors. And his murderous attempts to &#8220;work toward the Fuhrer&#8221; in the Wartheland&#8211;by displacing Poles, murdering Jews and other &#8220;undesirables,&#8221; and populating the East with Germans&#8211;were stymied by the cross-cutting jurisdictions, conflicting agendas, and professional jealousies that were one of the hallmarks of Nazi rule. Grieser did his best (or his worst, depending on how you look at it) to Germanize the Wartheland. He improvised, maneuvered, and &#8220;worked the system&#8221; such as it was in pursuit of the Nazi totalitarian project. Thankfully, he failed, demonstrating again that totalitarian dreams, though they can be horribly distructive, are a far reach from totalitarian realities.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

What&#8217;s that mean? Well, it means that more scholarly attention has probably been paid to Hitler than any other figure in modern history. Napoleon, Lincoln, Lenin and a few others might give him a run for his money, but I&#8217;d bet on Hitler. The fact that so much effort has been expended on Hitler presents modern German historians with a problem: it&#8217;s hard to say anything new about him.<br />
The fact that so much effort has been expended on Hitler presents modern German historians with a problem: it&#8217;s hard to say anything new about him.<br />
Surely <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/cass/staff/details.php?id=t.weber">Thomas Weber</a> knew this when he began to work on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199233209/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hitler&#8217;s First War: Adolf Hitler, the Men of the List Regiment, and the First World War</a> (Oxford UP, 2010). After all, a new book on Hitler&#8217;s wartime experience had come out in 2005. What more is there to say? It turns out that there is quite a lot if you know where to look. And Weber does. He uses an interesting approach to uncover novel information about Hitler. Weber acknowledges that the documentary record relating directly to Hitler&#8217;s personal wartime experience is thin (a few letters, some military reports) and, when it is thicker, biased (more than a few axe-grinding memoirs from a much later time). These documents, all of which have been pored over by historians, will not shed any new light on Hitler. So Weber turns to a much larger and more trustworthy body of sources: that produced by the officers and soldiers in Hitler&#8217;s unit, the List Regiment. Though these papers usually do not mention Hitler by name, they enable Weber to reconstruct what he must have experienced, to see what was typical and what was not in Hitler&#8217;s service record, and, on the basis of this information, judge the veracity of claims made by Hitler, Nazi propagandists, and historians about the impact of World War I on the the Nazi dictator.<br />
The result is a serious revision. Hitler (et al.) said that World War one &#8220;made&#8221; him the person he became. Weber shows in detail that this claim is false. Fundamental elements of Hitler&#8217;s worldview either pre-date the war (his German nationalism) or seem to post-date it (his radical anti-semitism). In fact, the war did two things for Hitler: it gave him credibility he could use as he entered politics and it convinced him that he was an expert in military affairs. He ran for office as a humble Gefreiter (private), a holder of the Iron Cross First Class; and he ran the war as a dilettantish know-it-all, often with disastrous consequences.<br />
The only revelation Hitler had in the trenches was a common one, namely, that war is a very nasty business. That he went on to start another, even bloodier one has less to do with his experience of World War One than the ideas he brought to the conflict and absorbed after it.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I fear that most people think that &#8220;history&#8221; is &#8220;the past&#8221; and that the one and the other live in books. But it just ain&#8217;t so. History is a story we tell about the past, or rather some small portion of it. The past itself is gone and cannot, outside science fiction, be revisited. And the histories in books are neither dead nor alive. They are zombies, endlessly repeating themselves, never having a new thought, never responding to anything you say. (Plato, by the way, is good on this subject.) In point of fact the only place that histories really live is in the minds of historians in the act of creation. In this context, the story is far from dead. Indeed, it hasn&#8217;t even been born. As historians read, research, and think, they make histories like a carpenter makes a table. Readers rarely get to see the historical craftsmen at their benches. All they see is the result.<br />
[pullquote]As historians read, research, and think, they make histories like a carpenter makes a table. Readers rarely get to see the historical craftsmen at their benches. All they see is the result.[/pullquote]<br />
Today we&#8217;ll have the opportunity to look into the history workshop with <a href="http://www.watsoninstitute.org/contacts_detail.cfm?id=4">Abbott (&#8220;Tom&#8221;) Gleason</a>. Tom has worked in academic history for nearly half a century. He has been everywhere, done everything, and faced every challenge a working historian can. And now he&#8217;s written a terrific memoir about his path, and that of historians of his generation in general: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/097555574X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">A Liberal Education</a> (TidePool Press, 2010). I came away from the book with a renewed appreciation of the hold Zeitgeist has on historians and their work. Tom was raised in a cultural milieu (the liberal WASP establishment) that has now largely vanished. That peculiar, specific context had a powerful impact (by his own admission, both positive and negative) on his historical opinions and writing. It was interesting for me to see how Tom, as a conflicted, thoughtful son of privilege, negotiated Harvard of the 1950s, academia in the 1960s, and the rise (and relative decline) of the Russian studies industry in the post war decades. With eyes wide open, he recognizes the limitations of his Cold-War scholarly cohort, the ways in which he and his colleagues saw some things while being oblivious to others. Sometimes they got Russia right; sometimes they didn&#8217;t. But they were always on a quest to find the historical truth. Tom&#8217;s memoir shows just how difficult that truth is to find.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I imagine the guys who first faced Bill Russell felt like I did when I had to guard <a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/c/carran01.html">Antoine Carr</a> in high school. I &#8220;held&#8221; Carr to 32 points. But no dunks! Russell&#8217;s opponents in college and the NBA rarely fared any better. Sports talk is full of hyperbole, but in Russell&#8217;s case most of it is true. In his time, he was far and away the best player to ever step on the court and, for most of his career, he completely owned every court he stepped on. He was so dominant that they changed the rules so less gifted players would have a chance.<br />
Bill Russell, however, was not only a surpassingly great basketball player, he was also an African American star in an era in which being an African American star (or just being an African American) was very complicated. Today we are used to seeing outstandingly successful blacks in all (or almost all) spheres of life. In the mid-1950s that just wasn&#8217;t true. The American ruling elite was lily white, and that&#8217;s the way most white Americans thought it should be. Bill Russell (and Jackie Robinson, Althea Gibson, Willie Mays, Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, among others) were anomalies: they were black, but they were both extraordinarily accomplished and remarkably famous. They couldn&#8217;t just be athletes; they had to be symbols of some promising (or frightening) new world as well. That&#8217;s quite a burden to bear.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520258878/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King of the Court: Bill Russell and the Basketball Revolution</a> (University of California Press, 2010), <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/history/bios/bio_goudsouzian.htm">Aram Goudsouzian</a> has done a great service by detailing the ways Russell bore this weight, and the ways in which he fought to throw it off. Aram makes clear that Russell was a conflicted soul. He lacked self-confidence, but he was brusk and even arrogant. He was friendly and gregarious to some, but often simply rude to others. He was hot tempered, but he affected a cool, distant demeanor. He believed he was a man of principle (and convinced others he was), but he periodically abandoned his family for a playboy lifestyle. If Russell couldn&#8217;t be honest about himself, he insisted on being honest about everything and everyone around him. He meant what he said and said what he meant&#8211;about race, about sports, about anything that bothered him. He was a sort of athletic Socrates, always questioning and never fully accepting the way things were. And, like Socrates, Russell was willing to suffer for his beliefs. As Aram points out, he did in many ways. But in the process he gained the respect of almost everyone he encountered. He was a hard man to like, but he was an easy man to admire.<br />
I should add that if you like white-hot game narratives, this book is full of them. Remember this?: &#8220;Greer is putting the ball in play. He gets it out deep and Havlicek steals it! Over to Sam Jones&#8230; Havlicek stole the ball! It&#8217;s all over&#8230; It&#8217;s all-l-l-l over!&#8221; Johnny Most, RIP.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Try to imagine having never seen an airplane. It&#8217;s hard. Aircraft are an ordinary part of our daily experience. Just look up and you&#8217;ll probably see one, or at least its vapor trails. Go to your local airport and you can fly in one pretty inexpensively. Heck, if you like, you can learn to pilot one yourself at any one of hundreds of flying schools. There is just nothing unusual or even very exciting about airships.<br />
It wasn&#8217;t always so. In the first quarter of the 20th century, airplanes were new. People had long dreamed of flight (see &#8220;Icarus and Daedalus&#8221;) and by the 19th century they&#8217;d done a little of it in balloons. But most folks could hardly conceive of a man (or woman) taking to the air like a bird. But men (and soon women) did just that. To many contemporary observers, flying in winged airships was nothing short of a miracle. Surely, pundits claimed, conquest of the air would usher in a new modern age.<br />
It did, but not in all the ways expected. As <a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/history/pages/profs/Kessner.html">Thomas Kessner</a> shows in his wonderfully told<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195320190/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank"> The Flight of the Century: Charles Lindbergh &amp; the Rise of American Aviation</a> (Oxford University Press, 2010), the experience of Charles Lindbergh is a case in point. To be sure, Lindbergh was an extraordinary pilot&#8211;skilled, meticulous, and remarkably brave. That, however, did not set him apart from the hundreds of other fly boys of the age. What did set him apart was: 1) luck (many of his contemporaries died in crashes, and he nearly did on many occasions); 2) a single insight, doggedly pursued (that a plane with one engine, one pilot, and an 2,385 pounds of fuel could make it from New York to Paris); and 3) the fact that after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic he became the most famous person in the world. Tom pays due attention to all three of these characteristics, but I found the last of them&#8211;Lindbergh&#8217;s incredible celebrity and its impact on him and the world&#8211;the most interesting. It&#8217;s arguable that Lindbergh was the first &#8220;superstar.&#8221; Though he had indeed done something extraordinary, he was the creation of a finely tuned, corporate-backed publicity campaign and a frenzied, tireless, and completely meritorious press corps. The people around Lindbergh understood that if they handled his &#8220;image&#8221; correctly they all could make a fortune. And so they took this gangly, taciturn, strangely aloof son of the prairie and made him the symbol of all that was good (and marketable) in the newly christened air age.<br />
The problem was that, eventually, Lindbergh refused to play along. He was who he was, and who he was was a loner. Celebrity wore on him. Now when most people get tired of attention, they go home. But after the Paris flight Lindbergh had no home. His entire life was public. So he did what so many frustrated celebrities with considerable resources (think Howard Hughes, Marlon Brando, J. D. Salinger) after him have done: he became a crank. He tried to find a way to live for ever, dabbled in &#8216;scientific racism,&#8217; and eventually got mixed up with the Nazis. Lindbergh, the arch-individualist, got tired of having people tell him who he was; he wanted to be his own man. And, in the end, he was, for good and ill.<br />
The lesson? If you are in the business of making and selling role models, it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to pick a 27-year old who has focused his life on some narrow pursuit to the exclusion of all others, even if he&#8217;s really good at it. You just don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re going to &#8220;be&#8221; when they grow up. (For more, see &#8220;Michael Jackson,&#8221; &#8220;Lindsey Lohan,&#8221; &#8220;LeBron James,&#8221; etc., etc.)<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you&#8217;re like me (and I hope you aren&#8217;t), the &#8220;Trial of the Century&#8221; involved a washed-up football star, a slowly moving white Bronco, an ill-fitting glove, and charges of racism. I watched every bit of it and remember exactly where I was when the verdict was announced. But if you are French (which is a nice thing to be), then there is only one &#8220;Trial of the Century&#8221; and it involved an honorable though stuffy army captain, a torn up note of no significance, a bungling military establishment, and charges of anti-Semitism. The erstwhile American football player (and actor, don&#8217;t forget he was an actor) was guilty, pretty much everyone knew it, but no one really wanted to take the issue on. The aloof French officer was innocent, pretty much everyone knew it too, but in this instance a kind of culture war broke out.<br />
France circa 1900 was at a fork in the historical road: on the left, the liberalism of the Revolution; on the right, the conservatism of the post-Napoleonic settlement. So which was it to be: France a nation of free-thinking citizens or France a nation of Catholic Frenchmen? The question was not definitively answered during the Dreyfus Affair, but new (and somewhat disturbing) possibilities were sketched out. The analysis of these new paths is one (among many) of the great strengths of <a href="http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/postholder/harris_r.htm">Ruth Harris</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805074716/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Dreyfus: Politics, Emotion, and the Scandal of the Century</a> (Henry Holt, 2010) . She shows that both sides&#8211;the Dreyfusards (aka &#8220;Intellectuals&#8221;) and the Anti-Intellectuals&#8211;used the Affair to elaborate their visions for France and, in the process, worked themselves into a tizzy. They began to believe things that, well, only a lunatic could believe. French political culture entered a kind of surreal moment (a bit like American political culture during the O.J. trial if you ask me). Alas, the French didn&#8217;t quickly come back to reality after the Affair ended. They organized parties and continued to fight. And they are still fighting.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I met George Kennan twice, once in 1982 and again in about 1998. On both occasions, I found him tough to read. He was a very dignified man&#8211;I want to write &#8220;correct&#8221;&#8211;but also quite distant, even cerebral. Now that I&#8217;ve read <a href="http://thehawkandthedove.nickthompson.com/index.php/the-author/">Nicholas Thompson</a>&#8216;s very writerly and engaging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003P2VDLA/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Hawk and the Dove: Paul Nitze, George Kennan, and the History of the Cold War</a> (Henry Holt, 2010) I can see that my impressions were largely correct. He was distant, cerebral, and, well, a bit hard to read. Not so the other protagonist in Thompson&#8217;s tale of two key personalities of the Cold War. Paul Nitze&#8211;who was Thompson&#8217;s grandfather&#8211;was a sort of &#8220;hail fellow well met,&#8221; the kind of backslapping, can-do guy that Americans like to think characterizes the &#8220;American Spirit.&#8221; Thompson skillfully weaves Kennan&#8217;s ying and Nitze&#8217;s yang into the story of America&#8217;s long struggle to come to terms with the Soviet Union and its &#8220;ambitions&#8221; (or lack thereof). In my humble opinion, Nitze comes off a bit better than Kennan, and not because of any bias on the author&#8217;s part; he&#8217;s quite even-handed. But they were both remarkable figures, and the book is a suitable testament to their achievements (and, I&#8217;m quick to add, foibles). The world they lived in&#8211;a time when a few ambitious men who had gone to the right schools, met the right people, and were given the power to chart the nation&#8217;s course&#8211;is largely gone. We&#8217;re fortunate that Thompson has so admirably brought it, and the world it made, back to life.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When I was in high school I had several friends who went to Wichita&#8217;s only <a href="http://www.wcsks.com/MainPage/MainPage.htm">prep school</a>. They were nice guys, played D&amp;D, andsaid they were &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism">Libertarians</a>.&#8221;I thought that &#8220;Libertarian&#8221; might have something to do with the library, so I wanted to have nothing to do with it. But they really wanted to spread the Gospel. So I listened. What they said made sense. We&#8217;re born free. We should be able to do whatever we want so long as we don&#8217;t hurt anyone. The authorities should get off our backs. Now this, I thought, was philosophy for a 16-year old.<br />
They told me to read Ayn Rand. I didn&#8217;t. Her books had too many pages. But my mother did, and I noticed a lot of other folks I knew did to. Rand, I was told, was a genius. I never really understood the Rand phenomenon until I read <a href="http://www.jenniferburns.org/">Jennifer Burns</a>&#8216; page-turning biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195324870/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Goddess of the Market. Ayn Rand and the American Right </a>(Oxford, 2009). Almost by accident, the foreigner Rand tapped into a deeply-rooted American desire to be LEFT ALONE. All teenagers want to be left alone, but America is the only country in world history to have a political culture built on the idea. Rand&#8217;s radical, romantic individualism was the pitch-perfect echo of Americans&#8217; frustration with the growth of the modern state (and teenagers&#8217; frustration with the stupidity of their parents). That and she was really entertaining. She wrote, said, and did outrageous things. She said they were all consistent with her philosophy, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_%28Ayn_Rand%29">Objectivism</a>.&#8221; Maybe. But they were also consistent with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzedrine">amphetamine</a> addiction. It goes without saying that her personal life was a train-wreck, though a very interesting one given that it was informed by a philosophical system (and drug abuse). The American desire to be LEFT ALONE has not vanished (cf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Paul">Ron Paul</a>), and neither has America&#8217;s fascination with Rand&#8217;s remarkable life. We should thank Jennifer for telling us about it.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Memorial day is coming up, and maybe you are going to take a little car trip. It might even be a &#8220;road trip,&#8221; one of the great American enterprises (which isn&#8217;t to say other folks don&#8217;t take them, but Americans can rightly say they invented this genre of fun). In 1953, Harry and Bess Truman took a road trip in a shiny new Chrysler. Without any secret service protection at all. Harry wanted to see what it was like to be a private citizen again. He did and he didn&#8217;t, as <a href="http://malgeo.blogspot.com/">Matthew Algeo</a> explains in his charming new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1556527772/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Harry Truman&#8217;s Excellent Adventure. The True Story of a Great American Road Trip</a> (Chicago Review Press, 2009). Even in those days, it was hard for ex-presidents to keep a low profile. Harry and Bess did their best, but people wanted to see them and talk to them. They did. Perhaps that&#8217;s what Harry wanted all along. It&#8217;s hard to say. But this much is sure: no American president could do anything similar today. George Bush (either one) can&#8217;t go to the store to buy a gallon of milk without his &#8220;detail,&#8221; and he probably couldn&#8217;t get fifty feet from his door without encountering a mix of well-wishers and protesters. Harry and Bess met a horde of the former and none of the latter. The presidency has changed, and so has America. Read all about it in this most readable of books.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Ronald Reagan was a odd fellow. Nobody seems to know what to make of him. He started as a Democrat and then became a Republican. Then he broke ranks with his party by running for president against a sitting Republican. As a leader, he appeared to be affably naive; yet he also seemed to be capable of formulating &#8220;three-steps-ahead&#8221; strategies. Once in office, he came to be known as the &#8220;great communicator&#8221;; yet it was always hard to figure out what he was really thinking. But the most paradoxical thing about Reagan was his sudden volte-face on the issue of working with the Communists. In 1980, he was the hardest of hardliners on relations with the Soviet Union. By 1986, he was seriously thinking about eliminating the entire American nuclear stockpile in a deal with a little-known Soviet leader named Gorbachev. The U.S. foreign policy establishment and conservative pundits threw a fit. But Reagan knew a good opportunity when he saw one, as <a href="http://apps.sais-jhu.edu/faculty_bios/faculty_bio1.php?ID=269">James Mann</a> points out in his thought-provoking, important new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143116797/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan. A History of the End of the Cold War</a> (Viking, 2009). Reagan seemed to understand what the &#8220;experts&#8221; didn&#8217;t: that Gorbachev really was different, that the Soviet Union&#8217;s grip on Eastern Europe was slipping, and that Communism itself was on the rocks. Mann does a masterful job of explaining how Reagan came to these &#8220;rebellious&#8221; views. His path was crooked indeed, twisting and turning through a cast of characters and series of incidents that will be familiar to few readers. Much has been written about the end of the Cold War. But Mann succeeds in telling a new story, one centered on the people who ended it&#8211;Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When we speak of the &#8220;Age of Discovery,&#8221; we usually mean the later fifteenth and sixteenth century. You know, Columbus, Magellan and all that. But the &#8220;Age of Discovery&#8221; continued well into the seventeenth century as Europeans continued to travel the globe in search of riches, fame and adventure. And after they made port at home, they often &#8220;wrote&#8221; books about their travels for readers eager to hear about what was &#8220;out there&#8221;&#8211;or at least what these travelers said was &#8220;out there.&#8221; Take the subject of <a href="http://www.cas.usf.edu/history/fs/boterbloem.htm">Kees Boterbloem</a> new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0230553184/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Fiction and Reality of Jan Struys. A Seventeenth-Century Dutch Globetrotter</a> (Palgrave MacMillan, 2008). Sturys was an illiterate, itinerant, indefatigable Dutch sail maker. He went everywhere, did everything, and when he got back from his adventures he was asked by some profit-seeking Dutch publishers to &#8220;contribute&#8221; his tales to a book about his travels. Of course Stuys could neither read nor write, but that didn&#8217;t stand in the way of the publishers. They assigned him a ghost writer who listened to Struys&#8217; stories and, where he found them wanting, embellished them with material purloined from other travel books. The results were part fact, part fiction, and all international bestseller. It was in such books that Europeans learned about the &#8220;discoveries,&#8221; and by such books that modern publishing was born. We should thank Kees for telling us the tale in this fascinating account.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the Soviet Union, artists lived lives that were at once charmed and cursed. Though relatively poor, the USSR poured resources into the arts. The Party created a large, well-funded cultural elite of which only two things were expected. First, that they practice their art. Second&#8211;and here&#8217;s the rub&#8211;that they tow the Party&#8217;s ideological line. Art under Communism was intended to enlighten the working class. In practice, that meant hewing to hackneyed tropes (&#8220;Socialist Realism&#8221;). Worse still, the Party could and did change its line at will. What was &#8220;progressive&#8221; one day could be &#8220;reactionary&#8221; the next. This made the lives of Soviet artists unpredictable. It was hard to say what the Party bosses&#8217; would want from one year to the next. In his masterful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199753482/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The People&#8217;s Artist: Prokofiev&#8217;s Soviet Years</a> (Oxford UP, 2009), <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~simonm/">Simon Morrison</a> offers an excellent example and analysis of the dilemmas Soviet artists faced. When Prokofiev came back to the Soviet Union in 1935, he was asked to accommodate his work to the &#8220;needs of the Party.&#8221; He did so and became a Party darling. But then things changed. Stalin&#8211;an expert in all things&#8211;decided that Prokofiev&#8217;s work was too &#8220;formal&#8221; (whatever that meant). And so he was out of favor, and remained so for the rest of his life. When he died&#8211;ironically on the same day as Stalin&#8211;his passing was hardly noticed. It&#8217;s a sad and instructive story, and we should all thank Simon Morrison for telling it.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you study pre-modern history in any depth, one of the most startling things you will discover is that &#8220;traditional&#8221; societies usually had an adversarial relationship with &#8220;nature.&#8221; They fought the wild tooth and nail in a never-ending effort to bring it under human control. It never really occurred to them that this effort at pacification&#8211;and the wanton destruction it brought&#8211;was wrong. On the contrary, it was man&#8217;s right. As the Hebrew Bible says, God gave man &#8220;dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.&#8221; Nature was ours, to do with as we pleased.<br />
John Muir was among the first people to take a different and more &#8220;modern&#8221; view. He, like others of the Romantic movement, felt that nature and divinity were intertwined. We should no more destroy a wilderness than we should take the Lord&#8217;s name in vain, for both the one and the other were sacred. In his remarkable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195166825/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">A Passion for Nature: The Life of John Muir</a> (Oxford UP, 2008), <a href="http://www.history.ku.edu/faculty/worster/">Donald Worster</a> tells us how Muir came by these rather odd sentiments and how he put them into practice. You know about Muir&#8217;s work: the Sierra Club, Yosemite National Park, Sequoia National Park, Muir Woods National Monument. Now read Worster&#8217;s wonderful biography and learn about the man himself.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Swords and Sandals&#8221; movies always amaze me. You know the ones I&#8217;m talking about: &#8220;Spartacus,&#8221; &#8220;Ben-Hur,&#8221; &#8220;Gladiator,&#8221; and the rest. These movies are so rich in detail&#8211;both narrative and physical&#8211;that you feel like you are &#8220;there.&#8221; But the fact is that we don&#8217;t and really can&#8217;t know much about &#8220;there&#8221; (wherever &#8220;there&#8221; happens to be in the Ancient World) because the sources are very, very thin. As <a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/sace/organisation/people/research_staff/tyldesley.htm">Joyce Tyldesley</a> points out in her terrific <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465018920/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Cleopatra: Last Queen of Egypt </a>(Basic Books, 2008), Cleopatra is a mystery and necessarily so. We don&#8217;t know who her mother was, when she was born, what she looked like, whom she married, and a host of other details about her life. That means, of course, that every dramatist from Shakespeare on has been, well, making stuff up about Cleopatra. Actually, many of the &#8220;primary sources&#8221; about her are full of invention because they were written long after the events they describe by Roman authors who just didn&#8217;t like her very much. They did like a good story, so they embellished, as any good storyteller will. Joyce is an excellent storyteller herself, but she takes no poetic license. She tells us just what can be known&#8211;and trust me, that&#8217;s more than enough to hold our attention! This book is a great read for anyone interested in learning about the real world of Ptolemaic Egypt.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.yale.edu/history/faculty/snyder.html">Tim Snyder</a> has written a great book. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465018971/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Red Prince: The Secret Lives of A Habsburg Archduke</a> (Basic, 2008). Of course it&#8217;s thoroughly researched. Tim&#8217;s read all the literature and visited all the archives. Of course it&#8217;s historically revealing. Tim&#8217;s told a story that no one has told before. And of course it&#8217;s relevant. The book is about empires becoming nations, an ongoing process in Russia, China, and India. We expect all this from a top-notch historian working in a field he knows like the back of his hand. But Tim has done more. He&#8217;s written a serious history book that is enjoyable to read. How&#8217;d he do it? Well, Tim&#8217;s picked the right subject: an Eastern European prince with dreams of uniting a &#8220;nation&#8221; that didn&#8217;t exist. Did I mention said prince liked to dress as a woman, consort with sailors, and slum in Montmartre? Tim&#8217;s picked the right voice: witty, knowing, and ironic, but never sarcastic. Irony is hard; sarcasm is easy. Tim&#8217;s picked the right style: rich enough to delight, but spare enough to let the story shine through. Think of Hemingway with the occasional understated joke. I&#8217;ve long aspired to write a book like this. Now that I&#8217;ve read one, maybe I can.<br />

The subject matter couldn&#8217;t be more interesting and the prose is as delightful as it is instructive. There are many laugh-out-loud, I-wish-I were-that-clever sentences in this book: &#8220;Scott was not to know that the UNIA leader was of the school of thought that translated &#8216;no&#8217; as &#8216;maybe&#8217; and maybe&#8217; as &#8216;yes.'&#8221; And many others that will make you sad. Grant is that kind of writer and Garvey that kind of figure. Go buy this book. Then read it.<br />

Dr. Foerstner teaches news writing and science writing at Northwestern University&#8217;s Medill School of Journalism. In addition, Dr. Foerstner served as a staff reporter for the suburban sections of the Chicago Tribune for ten years, where she wrote articles about science and the environment. She is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1587297957/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Picturing Utopia: Bertha Shambaugh and the Amana Photographers </a>(University of Iowa Press, 2000), as well as multiple articles on science, history and the visual arts. Her newest book, James Van Allen: The First Eight Billion Light Miles, took her seven years to research and write. Carl McIlwain, research professor of physics at University of California at San Diego, claims that &#8220;This in-depth portrayal of the life and work of an important twentieth-century scientist should take an important place both as a biography of an interesting life and as a resource for future historians of space physics.&#8221;<br />
