      <itunes:summary>81% of evangelical Christians voted for Donald Trump last year, despite his bragging about sexual assault, despite his multiple marriages, despite his wealth and complete lack of concern for the poor, despite his flip-flopping on matters of abortion and saying women who had them needed to be punished, despite the lies and racism and bigotry. It seems like they were going to vote for whoever the Republican candidate was no matter what. 

And that no matter what continues to play out today. Trump is a deeply unpopular president whose decisions and morals are constantly questioned. He may be nominating the Religious Right's Dream Team to judicial seats, including the Supreme Court, but beyond that, it's hard to see how he fits the mold of a &quot;family values&quot; conservative who inspires loves for Jesus.

So how did he do it? How did he convince evangelicals to support him, not just in the election, but to this day? And will there be any consequences for evangelicals moving forward? 

Stephen Mansfield explores all those questions in his new book Choosing Donald Trump: God, Anger, Hope, and Why Christian Conservatives Supported Him. 

I spoke with him about whether Trump's presidency will hurt evangelical Christianity, if there's anything Trump can do to lose the Religious Right's support, and why Trump's pandering rhetoric is so powerful.</itunes:summary>

He's spent 30 years as an executive at Focus on the Family, the ministry founded by James Dobson and known as one of the most anti-LGBTQ groups out there.

All of that became a problem when Amber came out as gay, a pivotal moment in her life which she writes about in her forthcoming memoir Refocusing My Family.

We spoke about how her relationship with her family changed after coming out, why she still believes in God, and why taking off her purity ring marked a new beginning.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>If you've followed the articles, movies, and TV shows about the Church of Scientology recently, you're probably familiar with the name David Miscavige, the man who runs the Church. His father is Ron Miscavige, and he joined the church in 1970. David was 10 at the time. It wasn't until 2012 that Ron escaped. Since then, he's worked hard to undo some of the damage caused by the Church, including their policy of basically shunning those outside of it. His book, now out in paperback, is called Ruthless: Scientology, My Son David Miscavige, and Me.

I spoke with Ron about whether his son knows that the Church's beliefs aren't real, why Scientology is so appealing to some people, and how he managed to break out of the bubble.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>If you’ve ever seen VeggieTales, you’re familiar with Phil Vischer. He’s the animator, puppeteer, writer, voice actor, and songwriter who co-created that series. His production company soon grew to over 200 workers by the year 2000 before a lawsuit sent the company into bankruptcy and forced Phil to basically start over again. He now runs Jellyfish Labs, where he produces faith-based content. He also hosts the Phil Vischer Podcast which is a very entertaining show all about Christianity in a post-Christian America. 

We spoke with Phil about why Christian media is so cringeworthy, how he tells Bible stories that may offend parts of his audience, and what the hell is happening with evangelicals in the upcoming election.</itunes:summary>

Garrison edited and published a Christian &quot;pro-life, pro-family&quot; newspaper for 16+ years in northeast Nebraska while home-churching, home birthing, and home schooling seven children. She made waves when she left the Quiverfull movement, divorced her husband, and began speaking out against the lifestyle. 

She recently received American Atheists' Atheist of the Year award and runs the blog &quot;No Longer Quivering&quot; to provide support to women and children who are escaping abusive religious movements and to provide the public with accurate and compassionate information on the unique challenges faced by the spiritually abused.

We spoke about what her Quiverfull lifestyle entailed, how she escaped it, and what advice she would give to other women in her position.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Chrystine Trooien is an eco-conscious, secular, vegan mother based out of Hawaii. About a year ago, she launched a Kickstarter campaign for a book called Christian Mythology for Kids. It’s essentially a book that explains the stories of the Bible as just that: Stories. They don’t disparage religion, and they don’t pretend any of it is real, either. They read just like Greek mythology -- with beautiful illustrations by artist Christopher Zakrzewski to boot.

      <description>Chrystine Trooien is an eco-conscious, secular, vegan mother based out of Hawaii. About a year ago, she launched a Kickstarter campaign for a book called Christian Mythology for Kids. It’s essentially a book that explains the stories of the Bible as just that: Stories. They don’t disparage religion, and they don’t pretend any of it is real, either. They read just like Greek mythology -- with beautiful illustrations by artist Christopher Zakrzewski to boot. It’s a wonderful way to introduce your children to these characters without indoctrinating them in the faith. 

We spoke with Chrystine about why it's important to teach kids these stories objectively, how she handled stories with no redeeming message, and whether she'll continue the series with other religions.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Dr. Wynne LeGrow spent two years as a physician in the Army, where he was promoted to major, and then nearly three decades in private practice. For most of his career, he practiced internal medicine.

In 2010, after he retired, he decided to run for Congress from Virginia’s 4th District, which was represented then (and now) by Republican Randy Forbes. Forbes is so conservative, he founded the Congressional Prayer Caucus. LeGrow, on the other hand, ran as an open atheist. He lost the race, but wrote about the experience in his new book Last Leper in the Colony: An Atheist Runs for Congress in the Bible Belt.

We spoke to him about what it was like being an atheist in the 1960s/1970s, the surprising politician who inspired him to run for office, and the advice he would give atheists running for office in the future.</itunes:summary>

Smalley is a former Christian musician who became an atheist after studying psychology, sociology, world religions, and his own faith. He soon turned into a secular activist.

But in 2012, he began doubting some of his beliefs. He was asked by a Church Educational System (or CES) director to share his concerns. Jeremy did that in what became known as the Letter to a CES Director, or the CES letter. It is a damning document that exposes so many holes in the Mormon faith and it quickly went viral online, giving a lot of people reason to leave the Church themselves. And then, earlier this year, wouldn’t you know it, Church officials began a process to kick him out. Before they could excommunicate him for good in April, Jeremy announced he was resigning from the Mormon Church himself. He wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction of kicking him out.

We spoke with Jeremy about what led him to start doubting his faith, how the &quot;Mormon moment&quot; from a few years ago has come to an end, and why he left the Church before it could get rid of him.</itunes:summary>

She's also a long-time blogger at the Dawn Patrol.

Before giving a talk at a church just outside of Chicago recently, we had 20 minutes to chat. We used the limited time to talk about her unique religious journey, whether allowing priests to have sex is a good idea, and how she arguably kickstarted my own career with one blog post.

I'm talking to him now because it's the tenth anniversary of the Kitzmiller v. Dover case which gutted the Intelligent Design movement. Miller was an expert witness for the science side.

I spoke with him about whether evolution advocates can finally relax, how a Roman Catholic like himself reconciles science and faith, and the effect of Creationist propaganda on science literacy.</itunes:summary>

He has also been requesting to deliver invocations as a Satanist, forcing several city councils to abandon the prayer practice altogether.

      <itunes:summary>We're thrilled to speak with the team behind YouTube sensation Mrs. Betty Bowers.

Andrew Bradley is the creator and writer for BettyBowers.com. If you haven’t seen the videos, Betty is American’s Best Christian, and she has a lot to say about traditional marriage, abortion, the upcoming elections, and so much more. She’s a hilarious parody of right-wing extremists.  Andrew was also one of the main writers for Landover Baptist Church, a parody of a fundamentalist Christian church that featured articles that people still believe are real. He’s also the author of Welcome to JesusLand.

Deven Green plays Mrs. Betty Bowers. She’s a comedian, musician, and performer. She was also a comedy judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race.

We spoke with Andrew and Deven about how they collaborate, the kind of hate mail they receive, and the origins of Landover Baptist Church.

By the way, this is our first time trying to host four people on the same phone call, so the audio's not always ideal, but hopefully it's all still audible!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Evangelist Ray Comfort has released a film called &quot;Audacity&quot; with the goal of convincing gay and lesbian viewers to renounce homosexuality. Jessica and I watched the film (so you don't have to) and we give you the play-by-play along with commentary. So there's your spoiler alert!

After that, beginning at the 34:44 mark, we have an *exclusive* interview with the film's star Travis Owens. He plays Peter, a very devout Christian who wants to spread the Good Word, but sometimes hesitates because it might be awkward. Because he hesitates, bad things happen -- especially to gays and lesbians who didn't accept Jesus into their lives.

In real life, Travis is actually very supportive of LGBT rights, which makes his appearance in this film both questionable and fascinating. 

We spoke with him about what it's like to work with Ray Comfort, whether he's received more feedback from LGBT viewers or Christians, and why he took on a role that contradicted his personal beliefs.</itunes:summary>

Because he hesitates, bad things happen -- especially to gays and lesbians who didn't accept Jesus into their lives.

In real life, Travis is actually very supportive of LGBT rights, which makes his appearance in this film both questionable and fascinating. 

We spoke with him about what it's like to work with Ray Comfort, whether he's received more feedback from LGBT viewers or Christians, and why he took on a role that contradicted his personal beliefs.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Jerry DeWitt was a Pentecostal preacher from Louisiana whose faith began cracking a few years ago. At first, he battled with his doubts internally, but he soon realized he no longer believed what he had been saying from the pulpit for nearly 25 years.

When he finally declared -- publicly -- that he was an atheist, his life began to fall apart. He wrote about his deconversion in his book Hope After Faith. You may have also seen him in the recent CNN special &quot;Atheists: Inside the World of Non-Believers.&quot;

Hemant spoke with Jerry recently about what led him to initially doubt his religious beliefs, his journey through the Clergy Project, and how he can still get himself into &quot;preacher mode&quot; when speaking.

We spoke with Trevor about the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the story, how it publicized his atheism more than he expected (especially as an ex-Mormon), and what Bible-buying trends look like online.</itunes:summary>

It’s called Secular Avenue. The website is SecularAvenue.org.

Secular Avenue will offer those people financial help, counseling, and legal assistance, among other things.

      <itunes:summary>David Niose has been the president of two major organizations, the American Humanist Association and the Secular Coalition for America. He currently serves as the AHA’s legal director. He’s also a lawyer who has argued in front of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court about why the Pledge of Allegiance shouldn’t be recited in public school classrooms. And he’s the author of the fantastic book Nonbeliever Nation. His latest book is called Fighting Back the Right: Reclaiming America from the Attack on Reason. 

We spoke with David about how we can convince unreasonable people to embrace reason, why the election of George W. Bush was a turning point for organized secularism in America, and which atheist ad campaigns are the most effective.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Parisa Tabriz is Google’s self-described “Security Princess,” a euphemism she created in part because “hired hacker” sounds kind of evil. Her job is to figure out the problems with Google Chrome and fix them before the bad guys do. That’s a pretty amazing job for anyone, much less a 31-year-old woman, which isn’t exactly the norm in the tech world. Last July, Elle magazine ran a long profile on her.

(Full disclosure: I knew Parisa in high school and we had classes together, though we haven’t talked much since graduating.)

We spoke with Parisa about how she gets into the mind of a hacker, how we can get more women into this field, and how ignorance really isn't bliss in her world.</itunes:summary>

They’ve also tried to put up a Satanic display in the Florida Capitol building. And, my favorite, after a Florida school district allowed an outside group to do a Bible giveaway for students, they requested to distribute a Satanic coloring book… which may lead to an end to outside book distributions for good in that district.

      <itunes:summary>Steve Wells is the author of the amazing Skeptics Annotated Bible, which documents all the contradictions and horrible things the Bible says. It’s one of the most useful websites for atheists I have ever seen and you can check it out at skepticsannotatedbible.com. The print version of the book is a must-have. Wells is also the author of Drunk with Blood, which documents all of God’s killings in the Bible. His newest book is called Strange Flesh, and it’s about how the Bible is used to justify anti-gay bigotry or, depending on who you talk to, support LGBT rights.

We spoke with Steve about his time in seminary, how one documents the number of deaths during an imaginary flood, and how Christian LGBT-rights advocate Matthew Vines gets it wrong.</itunes:summary>
