      <description>Going to see live theater, Bartlett Sher believes, is a unique experience... one that’s not just entertaining, but also has the power to change your view of the world. Sher is one of the most creative, thought-provoking Broadway directors working today (he directed the 2017 Tony award-winning best play, "Oslo"). Sher talks here about how a childhood trauma steered him toward the stage, and about finding new relevance in classic, beloved musicals like “South Pacific” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”   His most recent production is "My Fair Lady."

      <description>The star of theater, film and television talks about how acting has allowed him the life of a vagabond and the ability to challenge the status quo.  He tells the story of his childhood on a rural English island, and his first great success in the theater — as John the Baptist in the 1961 British production of the musical “Godspell".  The television hit "Brideshead Revisited” and the movie "The French Lieutenant’s Woman" followed, helping to secure his reputation as one of the great actors of his generation.

      <link>http://whatittakes.simplecast.fm/73d51900</link>
      <description>Jimmy Page’s plan all along was to transform rock n’ roll. And he did.  The band he founded, Led Zeppelin, remains one of the most influential and popular rock bands in history.  Page is one of the greatest guitarists of all time. His epic onstage solos, on hits like “Stairway to Heaven” and “Kashmir,” are legendary. And he was just as innovative as a producer.  On this episode Page talks about how he fell in love with American blues music, how he learned to play the guitar, and how his days as a session musician prepared him to upend the conventions of studio recording.  He also walks us through some of the Led Zeppelin songs he loves best.

      <description>For the past 60 years - ever since he made his American debut at 13 - Itzhak Perlman has made classical music fans swoon.
He is not only one of the greatest violinists of all time, but also a charming and passionate champion of the music.  On this episode, Perlman talks about falling in love with the violin at the age of 3, contracting polio (and losing use of his legs) at 4, and emigrating from Israel to the United States at 13, after an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.  He recalls some of his favorite performances, as well one where he forgot to play an entire movement and had to vamp!  And, he talks about why music sometimes moves us to tears.

      <description>Ernest Gaines grew up in the 1930's and 40's on the same Louisiana plantation where his ancestors were once slaves. After he became a successful and celebrated novelist, he returned, bought the land, and lives there even now. The voices he heard as a child,  telling stories on the porch or around the fire, are the voices that populate his novels: "A Lesson Before Dying,"  "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman," "A Gathering of Old Men," and others.  In this episode, Gaines describes the path that led him from picking cotton, to falling in love with literature, to writing award-winning novels. At the same time,  he shares his profound feelings about the limitations of that success.

      <description>Colin Powell has worn many hats, among them: Secretary of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and National Security Advisor. He was the first African-American to hold each of those positions. When he joined the Army in the 1950's, though, his only ambition was to be a good soldier.   It was beyond the realm of possibility for the son of working class Jamaican immigrants to aspire much higher.  In this episode, you'll hear Powell's stories about his journey from the South Bronx, to the jungles of Vietnam, to the Jim Crow South, to the highest reaches of government, and about the decades of American history he helped shape.

      <itunes:summary>When Jeff Bezos had the idea to start an online bookstore, he was working in a secure job on Wall Street. The internet was still young, and the average person had never made a purchase online. Bezos knew the chances of his company failing were high, but he also knew that if he didn't take the risk, he'd always regret it.  More than 20 years later, regrets are off the table. Amazon.com brings in 135 billion dollars in revenue, and Bezos is one of the wealthiest men in the world.  Hear him tell stories about the early days, before Amazon transformed the way we shop, read, watch &amp; listen.

      <description>Louise Glück uses simple, unsentimental language in her poems to evoke overwhelming emotions.  That rare combination is what has distinguished her as one of America's greatest living poets, for over half a century. In this episode, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, former Poet Laureate of the United States digs into the torment and uncertainty that has hounded her throughout her writing life.  She talks about how teaching poetry, which she feared would diminish her art, instead allowed it to flourish.   And she describes her obsessive desire to hear music in her ears, and language in her head.

      <description>Naomi Judd's life has had more ups and downs than a rollercoaster.  For eight glorious years, she and her daughter Wynonna were the biggest country music sensation of the 1980's, with fourteen number one hits, sold-out stadium tours, and too many rhinestones to count.  But Naomi's life before and since has been far from glamorous. In this episode, she talks about her tumultuous early life in small-town Kentucky and her struggles as a young single mom on welfare.  She recounts how singing transformed her relationship with Wynonna, and then took them to the heights of the music industry.  And she shares how the devastating disease that brought it all crashing down led her to a place of tremendous insight and gratitude.

      <description>In the fall of 1955, Rosa Parks refused to stand for a white passenger on the bus,  Martin Luther King Jr.  was chosen to lead the boycott that followed, and a lawyer named Frank Johnson was appointed to be the first and only federal judge for the middle district of Alabama (also the youngest federal judge in the nation). These three people didn't know each other, and yet, their paths converged in Montgomery, at the crossroads of history.  In this episode, you'll hear rare audio of Ms. Parks describing the day of her arrest, and you'll learn the lesser known story of Judge Johnson, a principled and stubborn Southerner from northern Alabama, who issued many of the court decisions decimating segregation throughout the south.

      <description>Some of Robert Langer's inventions sound like the stuff of science fiction: "smart" pills that can release medicine by remote control...  organs and bone, coaxed into growing on polymer scaffolds.   But these inventions are already in clinical trials, or in development at Langer's Lab at MIT,  the largest bioengineering lab in the country.   In this episode, Robert Langer talks about the very unconventional route he took from chemical engineer to medical pioneer, and he explains his first discovery, in the 1970's, which led to one of the primary treatments for Cancer.

These two astronauts changed history and broke a very high glass ceiling for little girls.  But they traveled different paths to get to NASA and achieve their dreams.  Sally Ride graduated from an elite private school in Los Angeles and earned a doctorate in Physics at Stanford, while Eileen Collins was raised in public housing in upstate New York and joined the U.S. Air Force, where she became a test pilot.  In this episode,  both women talk about the obstacles they overcame to reach the highest of heights.

      <description>No one could tell a story better than Frank McCourt.  His first book, Angela's Ashes, remains one of the most compelling accounts of poverty, alcoholism, and the longing for a better life.  It won a Pulitzer Prize, and transformed McCourt from a modest immigrant and a lifelong high school teacher, into a literary celebrity.  In this episode, you'll hear McCourt hold forth with tremendous humor and that lyrical voice - about the miseries of his childhood in Ireland, as well as his passion for teaching and writing.

      <description>This is the story of Les Wexner's path, from a tiny, old-fashioned neighborhood store in Columbus, Ohio, owned by his immigrant father...  to one of the biggest retail empires in the world.  His company, L Brands,  now includes that lingerie giant, Victoria's Secret, as well as Bath &amp; Body Works, and Henri Bendel.  But Wexner helped innovate the very idea of a specialty clothing chain store, with his first business: The Limited.  Wexner has been CEO longer than any other head of a Fortune 500 Company, and at almost 80, he's still not slowing down.

      <description>Nora Ephron knew just how to make people laugh and cry and kvell.  But mostly laugh.  She wrote some of greatest romantic comedies of all time, including "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle".  She was a successful director and producer too, in an industry not very hospitable to women.  In this episode, Ephron shares the most important lesson she learned from her mother:  that all pain is fodder for a good story.  She explains why becoming a journalist was the best thing she ever did.
And she tells stories from her later career in Hollywood, including the one about how the famous faked-orgasm scene in "When Harry Met Sally" came about.

      <itunes:summary>Nora Ephron knew just how to make people laugh and cry and kvell.  But mostly laugh.  She wrote some of greatest romantic comedies of all time, including "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle".  She was a successful director and producer too, in an industry not very hospitable to women.  In this episode, Ephron shares the most important lesson she learned from her mother:  that all pain is fodder for a good story.  She explains why becoming a journalist was the best thing she ever did.
And she tells stories from her later career in Hollywood, including the one about how the famous faked-orgasm scene in "When Harry Met Sally" came about.

      <description>The most astonishing winning streak in the history of sports, belonged to the Boston Celtics.  They won eleven championships between 1957 and 1969, eight of those in a row.  And the player at the center of those wins - was Bill Russell.  He changed the game of basketball, with his incredible speed, and his ability to block shots as no player had  done before.  When he took over as coach of the Celtics (while still playing on the team), he became the first African-American coach of any major sport in the U.S.   In this episode, Russell talks about his life in basketball, and he  describes how he was shaped by the racism he confronted, on and off the court.

      <description>Justice Sonia Sotomayor tells the extraordinary story of her voyage from  the  most dangerous neighborhood in the United States, to the highest court in the land -- a voyage fueled by the power of words.   In a wide-ranging conversation with NPR's Nina Totenberg, recorded at the Supreme Court in 2016, Sotomayor shares her earliest memories of life in the tenements of the South Bronx: her diagnosis with diabetes, her trips to the market with her beloved grandmother, her father's death, and her love affair with books.  She also talks about how she learned to learn, and to rely on the wisdom of friends and colleagues -- skills that carried her through Princeton, Yale, her prestigious legal career, and one beautiful throw from the pitcher's mound.

      <description>Sally Field is one of the best actresses in America... on film, on television and on stage.  She's won Emmy Awards and Academy Awards, and has had starring roles on Broadway. But early in her career, she was boxed in by her own success on tv, playing flighty girls like Gidget and The Flying Nun, and she couldn't find a way out.  But Sally Field would not accept that destiny.  She trained with the best acting teacher, Lee Strasberg, and transformed herself.  It took a while for Hollywood to catch up with her, but eventually got the kind of roles and recognition she deserved -- for films like "Norma Rae,"  "Places in the Heart," "Steel Magnolias,"  "Forrest Gump" and many others.  In this episode you'll get to know just how funny and charming and profound Sally Field is, as she talks candidly about her process of reinvention, and her discovery that fear is an essential path to change.

      <description>LinkedIn changed the way people navigate the world of work.  It's hard to even remember the days (though not that long ago) when jobseekers opened the back of a newspaper to scan the help wanted ads.   Well, LinkedIn was the brainchild of Reid Hoffman, one of the Silicon Valley visionaries who recognized, back in the 1990's, the internet's potential for a new kind of social and professional networking.  In this episode he talks about how his background in philosophy led him to tech entrepreneurship.  And he provides some fascinating stories about the early days of the online revolution.

      <description>Meet two giants of the American theater: playwright August Wilson and director Lloyd Richards.   Together they brought many award-winning plays to Broadway, including "Fences," "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," and "The Piano Lesson."   August Wilson, who wrote ten plays (together known as the Century Cycle), started out as a poet.  When he turned to writing plays, intent on telling the stories of African-Americans on stage, it was Lloyd Richards who recognized his talent and helped him shape it.  Richards was already an icon in the theater world.  He had begun his career a generation before,  aspiring to be an actor at a time when there were almost no roles for African-Americans.  His big break came when Sidney Poitier asked him to direct a new play called "A Raisin in the Sun" by Lorraine Hansberry.   In this episode you'll hear Lloyd Richards tell the story behind that ground-breaking production.   You'll also hear both August Wilson and Lloyd Richards describe how they came to meet and have one of the most successful artistic collaborations in history.

      <title>Dr. Jane Goodall: A Dedicated Pursuit</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">5197b76c-1b7c-4aaf-95c2-4732afd73145</guid>
      <link>http://whatittakes.simplecast.fm/22bd9ac4</link>
      <description>As a girl in England, Jane Goodall dreamed of traveling to Africa to study animals in the wild.  In 1960, that dream brought her to Tanzania, to observe the wild chimpanzees at Gombe Stream Park. As she describes in this episode, other scientists did not believe that a young woman could survive alone in the bush, but Jane Goodall did more than survive. Her work revolutionized the field of primatology.  She was the first to document chimpanzees making and using tools, an activity that had been thought exclusively humans. Over the years she also witnessed cooperative hunting and altruism, but also brutality and even warfare among chimps. Her work, the longest continuous field study of any living creature, has given us deep insights into the evolution of our own species.  Since the 1980's, she has devoted herself single-mindedly to educating the public worldwide about the connections between animal welfare, the environment, and human progress.

Her work revolutionized the field of primatology.  She was the first to document chimpanzees making and using tools, an activity that had been thought exclusively humans. Over the years she also witnessed cooperative hunting and altruism, but also brutality and even warfare among chimps. Her work, the longest continuous field study of any living creature, has given us deep insights into the evolution of our own species.  Since the 1980's, she has devoted herself single-mindedly to educating the public worldwide about the connections between animal welfare, the environment, and human progress.

      <description>Maya Angelou was a civil rights activist and a friend of Martin Luther King Jr., years before she became known throughout the world for her memoir “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."  In this, the second our two Maya Angelou podcasts, she offers her personal reflections of Dr. King as a poet and as a man with with great humility (and humor).   She talks about the state of the African-American community decades later, and the importance of using language to uplift (describing an encounter she had with Tupac Shakur to make her point).  And in her powerful, unique voice, she reminds us of the eternal relevance of Dr. King's wisdom.

      <description>Albie Sachs awoke one day in 1988 in a Mozambican hospital, with no remembrance of the car bomb that had maimed his body.  But it hadn't broken his will to remain in the struggle to end Apartheid in South Africa.  This episode is drawn from Sachs's 3-hour conversation with the Academy of Achievement. He tells stories, with love and with humor, about joining the movement as a young white teenager in the 1950's, about his detentions in solitary confinement, about helping to write his nation's new constitution, and about becoming one of the first justices on The Constitutional Court of South Africa.

      <description>When Doris Kearns Goodwin was six year old, she used to carefully document the Brooklyn Dodgers' games.    And that, she says, eventually led her to the career she now has, as one of America's favorite historians and political commentators.  Goodwin's books are so engaging, because they focus on the very human side of her subjects:  Lincoln,  Kennedy, Johnson, Taft and Roosevelt (Franklin, Eleanor AND Teddy).  In this episode, she talks about her unusual approach.  She also tells amazing stories about the extraordinary relationship she had with LBJ, which began when she was a White House fellow in her early 20's and led to her first book.  And, she describes a night unlike any other, sleeping in the bedroom where Winston Churchill slept as a guest in FDR's White House.

      <description>One of America's greatest living novelists begins every book by writing the the last sentence first.  In this episode, John Irving,  author of The World According to Garp, A Prayer for Owen Meany, and The Cider House Rules,  explains why.  And he might just convince you that his uncommon approach is the only one that makes sense!   Irving also opens up about his early life, and reveals how his mysteriously absent father, his learning disability, and his passion for wrestling all contributed to his success as a writer.  Whether you've read every John Irving novel or none, this is a fascinating story about the writing process, and about an author some critics have called the Charles Dickens of our time.

Her tale includes trips to the library with her mother, a sixty year romance with Marty Ginsburg, her struggles to become a lawyer in a field inhospitable to women, her surprising friendship with Justice Antonin Scalia, and even her days as an aspiring baton twirler!  The interview was conducted by NPR's Nina Totenberg, and explores some of the most important cases Ginsburg handled - as a lawyer and as a Justice - that helped transform the legal landscape for women (and men) in America.

He's just as accomplished as a classical musician,  a composer and an educator.  In this episode you'll hear Marsalis as a young man, still in his 20's, full of the fire and the talent that has carried him throughout his career.

      <description>One of the greatest revolutions in the treatment of cancer is underway. It's called immunotherapy, and the revolutionary behind it is Dr. Steven Rosenberg.  Dr. Rosenberg has been the Chief of Surgery at the National Institute of Cancer for over four decades. During all that time he  has doggedly pursued this radical idea -- that a patient's immune system could be sparked or retrained to attack cancer cells.   It's an idea that was dismissed by most of the medical establishment, until patients with terminal melanoma began to survive, cancer-free, under Dr. Rosenberg's care.   Now immunotherapy is one of hottest areas of medical research around the world.  In this episode you'll hear the story of Dr. Rosenberg's almost super-human determination, and you'll hear from one of his patients.

      <description>When Englishman Roger Bannister was studying medicine at Oxford in the 1940's, he began to have great success as a member of the track team. He knew enough about physiology to question a long-held belief: that humans were simply not built to run a mile in less than four minutes. He was determined to shatter that myth, and he did. In this episode, Bannister describes how he developed his own unique approach to training, one that allowed him to very gradually improve speed, while leaving time for his studies in neuroscience. After eight years, he was ready. At a meet held in May of 1954, he stunned the world, running a mile in 3:59.4.   It is considered one of the greatest athletic achievements of all time, alongside Sir Edmund Hillary's ascent of Mt. Everest.

      <description>After World War II, when few survivors of the Holocaust were willing or able to describe what they’d been through, Elie Wiesel decided silence was not an option. Even if words could never adequately express the horrors, the world had to know what had happened.  He wrote “Night," and became the best-known witness to the Nazi atrocities, as well as winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. In this episode Elie Wiesel (who died on July 2, 2016) explores how it was possible for him to find hope after Auschwitz and Buchenwald, by defending the victims of hate and injustice around the world.
He also talks about his childhood devotion to God, and the "wounded faith” he was able to find as a survivor.

      <description>While listening to this episode, we dare you to NOT sing out loud.  Carole King and Hal David were each one half of a legendary songwriting duo, and each responsible for many of the greatest songs of the 1960’s and 70’s (too many to start mentioning here, but we packed as many as we could into the podcast). If you like a medley, you’re in the right place.  Carole King worked with (and was married to) Gerry Goffin.  Hal David worked with Burt Bacharach.  They all worked in New York City’s Brill Building early in their careers, surrounded by record label execs, music publishers, radio promoters, and pianos. Lots and lots of pianos.  The impact they had on music in the second half of the 20th century is undisputed.

      <description>There is only one surviving superstar from the Golden Age of Hollywood:  Olivia de Havilland.  The actress who portrayed Melanie Hamilton in "Gone With The Wind" (and admit it: you liked Melanie better than Scarlett, right?) turns 100 years old on July 1, 2016.  This episode features an extensive conversation with Ms. de Havilland about the early days of the American film industry.   She explains how the studio system confined her to the role of the ingenue, and how she eventually broke out of it to play some of the more complex and fascinating  women on the silver screen -- including two that won her Academy Awards for Best Actress (in "To Each His Own" and "The Heiress").

      <description>Steven Spielberg hired Janusz Kaminski as the cinematographer for "Schindler's List” twenty-five years ago, and they have worked together, hand-in-glove, ever since.  Their collaboration has produced "Saving Private Ryan,"  "Bridge of Spies," "Lincoln," and many others.  In this episode, both filmmakers tell how they fell in love with the movies, and learned to make them.   Spielberg talks about his first camera and trusting his instincts, and Kaminski talks about how growing up in 1970's Poland gave him an unusual eye on the world.

      <description>How do you become a multi-billionaire, and the most successful hedge fund manager ever?  Ray Dalio attributes his success to transcendental meditation and what he calls "radical honesty.”  In this episode, he lays out the principles that have guided his life and his investment firm, Bridgewater Associates.  He also talks about caddying for Richard Nixon as a child, his first investment at age 12, and how he managed to go from being a terrible high school student to a graduate of the Harvard Business School to founder of a fund that manages $150 billion in global investments.

      <description>The Innocence Project has freed 1000’s of people serving time in prison for crimes they did not commit.
Thousands.  People who were misidentified by eyewitnesses, or were manipulated into false confessions,
or were the victims of unreliable forensic science.  Barry Scheck is the co-founder of The Innocence Project, and
in this episode he talks about the developments in science that led him and his colleagues to believe that DNA
testing could reduce wrongful convictions and transform the criminal justice system.   He also discusses some
of the very high profile clients he’s represented during his career, including OJ Simpson, Hedda Nussbaum
and Abner Louima.  And he reveals how his unusual childhood, with a tap dancing father and a speed skating
mother, led him on his life’s path as a seeker of justice.

      <description>Whether you grew up watching The Carol Burnett Show, or your parents did, this comedian, actress, singer and writer is someone you want to get to know better.   Burnett broke new ground when she launched her own television variety show in 1967 (hosting was still a man's game in those days).  And she kept Americans laughing for the next 11 years.   She had a huge influence on the comedians that followed in her footsteps, including Tina Fey,  Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, and Kristin Wiig.  In this episode she talks about her very humble beginnings and dysfunctional family, her mysterious benefactor, her breakthrough role on Broadway, and the path that finally landed her in the medium she loved best - television.  She also describes the moment she knew that making people laugh was what she wanted to do for the rest of her life.

      <description>During March Madness, can you think of anything more satisfying to do between games than listen to an interview with legendary coach John Wooden?!  Wooden led UCLA to more NCAA championships than any other team in history, and he did it with a quiet, old-fashioned approach that challenged notions of what it takes to win.  Wooden talks about his fatherly love for the players, his famous pyramid of success, and the difference between reputation and character.  He also explains why basketball is the greatest spectator sport there is.

      <link>http://whatittakes.simplecast.fm/1f7dc7cb</link>
      <description>In this episode, an intimate history of two pocket-sized devices that changed the world, and the two men who created them: Steve Jobs and Tony Fadell.  Jobs famously co-founded Apple.  In the late 90’s, when the company was failing, he hired a young engineer and designer named Fadell, who created a little device that became known as the iPod.  It not only turned Apple’s fortunes around, it transformed the music industry and the experience of listening. Fadell’s next assignment was the iPhone, which changed the nature of communication itself.  After leaving Apple, Fadell went on to found Nest Labs, a company that has begun to alter the technology of the home. You’ll hear Tony Fadell’s fascinating personal story, told with all the passion and enthusiasm he brings to his game-changing inventions.  And you’ll hear Steve Jobs, speaking as a young man (in 1982) about what it takes to innovate.

      <description>Sidney Poitier changed America’s view of black men.  And he changed Hollywood (though the change is far from over, given the issues of diversity at this year’s Oscars.).  The star of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,”  “The Defiant Ones,” and “In The Heat of the Night” was the first African-American to win an Academy Award - for “Lillies of the Field” in 1964.  He was a leading man and box office sensation throughout the 1950’s and 60’s, portraying a huge array of characters with a dignity, courage and humanity that was radical for its time.  In this episode, featuring an interview with Poitier at 82, you’ll hear him discuss how his childhood on a tiny island in the Bahamas made all the difference in his view of himself, and in the choices he made throughout his career as an actor.

      <description>Lauryn Hill has had an outsized impact on the world of hip-hop, soul and R&amp;B.  She entered the music world in the mid-1990’s as one third of the band The Fugees, and soon after released a solo album, “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill”.  It was a phenomenon, and swept the Grammys.  But then Ms. Hill pretty much vanished from music and public life, in an internal battle between fame, family and faith. On this episode you’ll hear the incomparable and enigmatic Lauryn Hill, speaking in 2000, just as she had begun her retreat.  She’s open, honest, raw and very funny about the transformation she was undergoing.

      <description>Andrew Young has worn many hats:  pastor, congressman, ambassador &amp; mayor, but his first role in public service was as Martin Luther King Jr’s strategist and negotiator.  He was at King’s side for many of the biggest battles of the civil rights movement, and he helped draft and secure the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  In this episode, Young shares his unique, personal stories about that turbulent period in our country’s history - from the center of the storm.  He pays tribute to the women who were the often unacknowledged backbone of the civil rights struggle.  And he recounts his fascinating life story, from his youngest days growing up in New Orleans, where his father taught him to fight racism with brains and heart, to his spiritual revelation at the top of a mountain.

      <description>Lee Berger has made two extraordinary scientific breakthroughs that are transforming our understanding of human evolution.   Berger is a trailblazing paleoanthropologist.   His most recent discovery involved a dramatic expedition through a 7-inch tunnel, deep inside the chamber of a South African cave.  On the floor were thousands of bones, belonging to an unknown species of human relative that Berger has named “Homo naledi.”    Berger explains why he believes that Homo naledi was intentionally disposing of its dead (a practice thought to be exclusively human), and he discusses his lifelong passion for adventure.

      <description>Desmond Tutu was the moral force that helped bring down Apartheid in South Africa. As a young priest, he was not very political, despite the fact that he’d grown up under the most brutal form of segregation.  But his theology evolved, he says, and he realized it was a divine calling to fight for justice.  In this episode you’ll hear Archbishop Tutu describe his personal, spiritual and political journey -- including the Nobel Peace Prize and chairmanship of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  You’ll also hear his passionate explanation of why humans are essentially good, no matter how often it may seem to the contrary.

Along the way, while writing and directing Star Wars, Indiana Jones and American Graffiti, he learned life-changing lessons about humility, generosity, and the inestimable value of friendship…. as well as the secret to happiness.  A not-too-subtle hint here: it has nothing to do with fame and fortune.

      <description>"There are some things in life you control.  I don't know that you control the sweeping hands of destiny."  Admiral William "Bill" McRaven's destiny was to plan and oversee the raid that killed Osama Bin Laden.  True, he may not have controlled the historical moment, but his intensive training and vast experience as a Navy Seal and a commander enabled him to carry out the precision operation and change history.  In this episode you'll hear about what it means to be in Special Ops, but you'll also learn why the former Admiral - now Chancellor of the University of Texas - believes that sometimes it's the little things you do in life that may change the world the most.

      <description>James Michener was born to tell stories. He was one of the most popular and best-selling American novelists of all time… able to merge equal parts fiction, history, geography and culture into a perfect, page-turning blend.  But when you hear Michener’s voice in this episode, you’ll realize his enormous talent for storytelling was not limited to the page.  He is sure to win you over in this 1991 interview, recorded when he was 85 years old and was looking back on his own dramatic life story.  He talks about the unlikely approach he took to overcoming considerable obstacles, and about his very first venture into writing fiction, when he was stationed on an island in the Pacific during World War II. The book that emerged from that experience was "Tales of the South Pacific," which won him a Pulitzer, and later became the Broadway hit and movie: “South Pacific.”  Michener also describes what he calls some of the “differential experiences” in his life, like the very moment he decided he would live his life as if he were a great man.  And he extols all of us listening to look out for unexpected opportunities and grab them.

      <title>Mike (Coach K) Krzyzewski: Inspiring Greatness</title>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">fbcba6c6-c43d-4c94-bedf-2f5f5a6683ce</guid>

      <description>Coach K, as Mike Krzyzewski is best known, has more wins than any other men's basketball coach in the NCAA.  He’s placed his team - the Duke University Blue Devils - in five consecutive Final Fours, won five national championships, and is the first coach in the history of NCAA Division 1 men’s basketball to win 1,000 games.  He also has three Gold Medals under his belt, as coach of the USA Men’s National Team.
In his 30 years with the Blue Devils, Coach K has proven he has a winning recipe for leadership and inspiration, and that starts, as he says in this episode, with relationships. It’s a talent he’s honed since he was a kid, growing up in a working class part of Chicago, where there were no little leagues.  Whenever groups of kids gathered on the basketball courts in his neighborhood, he says:  “Somebody had to organize it, and it was always me."

      <description>BB King began life as a humble Mississippi cotton farmer, and ended up one of the most influential guitarists and singers of the past century. Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt, The Rolling Stones and many others are among his disciples.  During his lifetime he was celebrated by presidents, kings &amp; queens - and declared a national treasure.  The interview you’ll hear in this episode was recorded at the 2004 Academy of Achievement Summit in Chicago, and includes stories about King’s prowess on a cotton field as well his awakening to the racial injustice all around him.  He recalls seeing the bodies of people who’d been lynched…  and years later, the feeling he had the first time he arrived to play before an adoring crowd of white fans.

      <description>Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in 2007, just after she returned from exile in the hopes of becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan for the third time. She had held the position for the first time in the 1980’s, and then again in the 90’s.  When she was still in exile, unsure whether she would ever return to Pakistan to run again, Bhutto sat down with the Academy of Achievement for a long and candid interview.  In this episode of What It Takes, you’ll hear the highlights of that conversation.  She describes how her childhood fed her belief in democracy and women’s rights, as well as her abhorrence of violence and poverty.   She talks openly about the failings of her leadership when she was Prime Minister and the lessons they taught her. It is haunting to hear Benazir’s profound words here and know that Pakistan might have been on a different course were she still alive. 
“I feel that society is like a canvas, and that if you get into office you're given an opportunity to paint it.  And it's up to you whether you make a good picture or whether you make a bad picture.”

      <title>Jonas Salk: Vanquisher of Polio</title>

      <link>http://whatittakes.simplecast.fm/4f9c5f67</link>
      <description>Before Jonas Salk created the Polio vaccine, thousands of children died every year or were left paralyzed by the virus (adults too). In 1952 alone, there were 58,000 cases in the United States.  When news of the discovery was made public on April 12, 1955, Jonas Salk was hailed as a miracle worker. He further endeared himself to the public by refusing to patent the vaccine. He had no desire to profit personally from the discovery, but merely wished to see the vaccine disseminated as widely as possible. The interview with Dr. Salk featured in this episode was recorded in 1991.  In it, Salk talks about being the child of uneducated immigrants, and carving his own path to medical school and eventually virology -- a specialty that didn't exist when he began as a researcher.  He discusses the anti-semitic quotas he had to overcome, as well as the doubt and scorn of many of his peers.  But he also describes the transformation and relief his polio vaccine brought to the world.

      <description>Oprah Winfrey’s career in broadcasting started when she won Nashville’s Miss Fire Prevention Contest.  She was 17.

Part Two of our Oprah conversation focuses on Oprah’s life in media. It was too hard to fit everything fascinating the Queen of Talk had to say into one episode!  Here, she describes the reasons she was terrible at news reporting and terrific at talk show hosting.  She also talks about how she stopped imitating Barbara Walters and developed her own voice, how she willed herself into the acting role of a lifetime, and how the key to success in her life has been trusting her instincts.

      <description>“Fourth grade is when I first began to believe in myself…  I felt I could control the world.” 
On this episode of “What It Takes,” Oprah Winfrey talks frankly about the inner voice that allowed her to survive a trauma-filled childhood with unwavering focus and unrelenting determination, to become the top-ranking television talk show host of all time.   She describes learning oration, at an age when most of us have yet to speak in full sentences.   And she tells stories about intensely personal revelations she experienced WHILE she was on the air, interviewing other people. Oprah is currently the wealthiest African-American and the most philanthropic, but in this conversation, recorded in 1991, she defines her success in ways her fans might find surprising.

      <description>Baseball fans may argue to this day about which was the best of Willie Mays’ many spectacular catches, but nearly all agree — he was one of the most versatile, virtuosic players of all time. In this episode, featuring an intimate interview with Mays recorded in 1996, the Hall-of-Famer talks about growing up in segregated Alabama, and winning over racist baseball fans soon after he became the first African-American player on his team.  He recalls the day he got the call to move up to the majors, and describes in delightful terms how he never had to actually work at being a great athlete. He also talks about the catch he swears was better than “The Catch.” Hearing his voice, you’re reminded why Willie Mays was one of America’s most beloved baseball players, as well as one of its greatest.

In this episode, featuring an intimate interview with Mays recorded in 1996, the Hall-of-Famer talks about growing up in segregated Alabama, and winning over racist baseball fans soon after he became the first African-American player on his team.  He recalls the day he got the call to move up to the majors, and describes in delightful terms how he never had to actually work at being a great athlete. He also talks about the catch he swears was better than “The Catch.” Hearing his voice, you’re reminded why Willie Mays was one of America’s most beloved baseball players, as well as one of its greatest.
