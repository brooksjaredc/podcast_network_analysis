		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today we are joined by <a href="http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/wsas/academics/anthropology/gsnyder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory Snyder</a>, an Associate Professor of Sociology at Baruch College, City University of New York (CUNY), and author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qg30zytrpkpWMncjP_5u6VUAAAFjT4Es7AEAAAFKAVzlEQg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814769861/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0814769861&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=YF3L9jprlUzYbzbcrcnGvw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skateboarding LA: Inside Professional Street Skateboarding</a> (New York University Press, 2017).  In Skateboarding LA, Snyder explores the world of professional street skateboarding in order to explain how the skate subculture produce a rich urban community and significant profits for professional skaters in spite of the widespread illegality of the sport.<br />
Based on almost a decade of ethnographic interviews with skateboarders, videographers, and promoters, Snyder de-centers notions of skateboarders as criminals and vandals. Instead he describes skaters as creative forces in the city: impromptu repair crews, street architects, amateur historians, urban explorers, and public space activists.  He shows how skaters see public spaces differently: stairs, benches, handrails, and fountains become potential obstacles for tricks.  They produce their own language to describe new maneuvers and produce the history of these unique sports spaces online in videos and in magazines.  And when those spaces are threatened, skateboarders organize publicly to save them as they did in the case of the West LA Library.<br />
You do not need to be interested in extreme or lifestyle sports to enjoy Snyder’s work because his larger conclusions concern the abilities of subcultures to preserve and grow in spite of public opprobrium.  Anthropologists and ethnographers in the Birmingham School studied the way subcultures used pastiches of styles as a form of symbolic resistance to “win space.”  Previous histories of skateboarding adopted this theoretical model to investigate skateboarders as a resistance subculture.  Snyder rejects this view because it paints subcultural groups as ultimately futile, destined to become commodified by outside forces.  Snyder shows how the commodification of street skateboarding occurred largely on its own terms and generally through the efforts of professional and former professional skateboarders working in subcultural careers.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Ted Cruz for Senate were persuaded to get behind the eventual Republican nominee, and how some Pentecostal and Charismatic leaders had been quicker to get behind Trump than other Christians. Strang addresses why Trump’s reputation as “morally libertarian,” which troubled some evangelicals, was outweighed by what was considered a greater imperative to defeat the “secular Left,” “political correctness” and “global government.” And Strang sheds light on the belief by some in the evangelical community that God played a direct role in Trump’s election.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Appeals to “press freedom” can be heard from across the political spectrum. But what those appeals mean varies dramatically. <a href="https://historyarthistory.gmu.edu/people/slebovic">Sam Lebovic</a>, in his excellent new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QoV9rbtlEbQm8Jts7H1J5OEAAAFjRWKkNQEAAAFKAfnmkA4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674659775/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0674659775&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=0gCgoh6hWlMSkKXAQgipiw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Speech and Unfree News: The Paradox of Press Freedom in America</a> (Harvard University Press, 2016), traces the fraught history of that contested concept throughout the twentieth century. Beginning his analysis in the 1920s, Lebovic shows how conservative politicians, lawyers, and publishers began to define press freedom as freedom from state censorship, wrapped it in the first amendment, and fought New Deal attempts at regulation. Meanwhile, liberal politicians and journalists feared corporate control of the press as a threat to the democratic need for information, and advocated a freer and more trustworthy press. Not interested solely in the debates over press freedom, Lebovic also focuses on, what he calls, “the everyday politics of information.” He reveals how state classification practices and the political economy of the news fundamentally shaped how information flowed. It is an ambitious book that succeeds in telling a crucial story and it should inform contemporary approaches to press monopolization and the ever-growing “<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/427309">classified universe</a>.” The book will interest intellectual historians, communications scholars, legal historians, political historians, and historians of U.S. foreign relations.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today we are joined by <a href="http://jesseberrett.com/">Jesse Berrett</a>, author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkTYGMKzGoDBciQOT9HDFMcAAAFjRXOyNgEAAAFKAZ87u8w/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252083326/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0252083326&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=q-TNhpz6-mA3bpjVkuWXZA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigskin Nation: How the NFL Remade American Politics</a> (University of Illinois Press, 2018). Berrett is a high school history teacher at University High School in San Francisco. He earned a PhD in History at the University of California, Berkeley, and has worked as a rock critic, television columnist, and book reviewer. In his new book, Berrett looks at the National Football League of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and how President Richard M. Nixon channeled his love for football into a useful tool to achieve political goals. Going to college football games like the 1969 Texas-Arkansas clash, talking baseball or drawing up plays for NFL coaches was not only a truly passionate response by Nixon, but also a productive wedge issue that allowed the president to connect with the audience he most coveted — conservative, middle-class American fans, particularly in the South. Nixon always identified with the underdog, and using sports metaphors about teamwork, character and a strong ethic were themes he hammered home in his speeches. Nixon is a major theme in this book, and the sports angle provides a fresh perspective on a conflicted, fascinating political figure. But Pigskin Nation also looks at how NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle saw a marketing bonanza and used politics to help pro football surpass major league baseball as America’s go-to sport.<br />

Drawn from extensive archival research and personal interviews spanning three continents, Mitchell’s book attempts to recast the Carter administration as an active, and in some cases forceful, participant in the Cold War. By examining key areas of conflict, most notably Rhodesia and the Horn of Africa, Mitchell illustrates the continuity and shifts in American foreign policy on the continent, while highlighting the importance of Carter seeing these crises “through the prism of the civil rights struggle”. Bringing together the interlocking relationships of the likes of Henry Kissinger, Cyrus Vance, Adwar Sadat, Andrew Young, Ian Smith, and Kenneth Kaunda, her book provides one of the most complete pictures of the Carter administration’s dealings with the African continent and its legacies for US and international policy across the globe.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As any scholar of the Vietnam War can tell you, the field doesn’t lack for study: it’s one of the most-studied fields for both military and diplomatic historians. And yet, for all of the scholarly attention it has received, there are understudied facets of this complicated, multilateral conflict, particularly in its early years, before American ground troops entered the country in large numbers. <a href="https://history.sfsu.edu/people/faculty/jessica-elkind" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Elkind</a>’s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhRY-0R9O76XI3j8RmYtCbQAAAFjQEPdMwEAAAFKAbPqVkQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813165830/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0813165830&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=mLZJkOHM.Z5.G7stFAgUcQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aid Under Fire: Nation Building and the Vietnam War</a> (University of Kentucky Press, 2016) does precisely this by examining U.S. development programs that tried to foster a viable South Vietnamese state in the 1950s and early 1960s. The outcomes of those disparate programs ultimately deepened a U.S. commitment to the Republic of South Vietnam and helped set the United States on the road to war.<br />
Dr. Elkind’s research was conducted using U.S. government sources, private collections from Michigan State University, and South Vietnamese government sources held in Ho Chi Minh City. Michigan State University was an important actor in this narrative because it was responsible for establishing and running certain programs. In each of the book’s five chapters, she examines a different aid program, ranging from the resettlement programs created for refugees fleeing the newly-created North Vietnam, to agricultural aid and development, to police training. What emerges from these various perspectives is a view of widely-ranging intentions and goals that often differed starkly. Not only did the U.S. government and South Vietnamese government disagree on what would constitute effective aid and development, the public-private partnership that existed between the U.S. government and Michigan State University also frayed as the individual aid workers began to lose faith in their mission.<br />
As the United States and the international community confronts global problems about development and nation-building, Aid Under Fire suggests lessons that policymakers and the public should heed. Development cannot succeed without taking into account the wishes of the people who are receiving aid, and simply transplanting western modalities cannot work without taking into account the conditions on the ground. As Elkind demonstrates, overconfidence in nation-building can have dire consequences.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The American West has always been home to many deities, argues <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/rs/faculty/jg53287" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Graber</a> in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiKDBaR0xIxqx1FhQTKKK2MAAAFjOrDhfQEAAAFKARpPuUE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190279613/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190279613&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=953tluX-JQx.PhfSNzUrmA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gods of Indian Country: Religion and the Struggle for the American West</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018). Graber, an associate professor of religious studies at the University of Texas-Austin, tells the story of the Kiowa over the course of the long nineteenth century. For Kiowas, the continuation of well-established spiritual beliefs and practices sustained them in the face of great challenges, but at times these same elements were dynamic enough to change and adapt to fit new realities. Among the new realities were alliances with powerful neighbors such as the Comanche, with whom the Kiowa shared the Sun Dance ritual. Another was a growing rivalry and at times widespread bloodshed with Americans, whose Christian missionaries fought as much amongst themselves as they did for Native converts. Missionaries often operated under the guise of being “friends of the Indian,” even when their purposes were ultimately dispossession and cultural erasure. The Gods of Indian Country is a deep look at how one Native American society and their settler colonial conquerors  relied upon faith in the face of both success and failure, joy and sorrow, in a rapidly changing West.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Folklore scholar <a href="http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/calandra/joseph-sciorra-phd-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph Sciorra</a> is the Director for Academic and Cultural Programs at the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute in Queens College which is part of the City University of New York.  He’s also a Brooklyn-born and -raised Italian American and in this episode of the New Books in Folklore podcast, he talks about his latest book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuyTAO-3JhEKY5BQJgXSHEcAAAFjO07nlgEAAAFKAbC-jNQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/162190119X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=162190119X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=9deb3imTEd2GY2xDJw41qQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Built with Faith: Italian American Imagination and Catholic Material Culture in New York City </a>(University of Tennessee Press, 2015) which “offers a place-centric, ethnographic study of the religious material culture of New York City’s Italian American Catholics” (xiv).<br />
A transdisciplinary work, albeit firmly grounded in folklore scholarship and based on ethnographic research conducted over 35 years, this book is a comprehensive study of the myriad ways in which a people express their personal religious faith in tangible, dynamic, and often public forms.  The resulting yard shrines, sidewalk altars, elaborate presepi (Nativity scenes), and other manifestations – which also include extravagant Christmas light adornments of domestic exteriors, The Our Lady of Mount Carmel Grotto in Rosebank, Staten Island, and a series of Brooklyn religious processions &#8211; usually receive no kind of official sanction. In fact, they are more likely to provoke disdain than approbation in most quarters.  Nonetheless, they allow residents to both meaningfully relate to and actively construct the city in a way that is unique to “New York” and also speak to a vernacular Italian-American ethos that sets great store by the concept of lavoro ben fatto, or “work done well”.<br />
In Built with Faith, Sciorra gives prominence to the voices of the creators of this landscape of devotional material culture, voices which he has captured over decades in formal interviews as well as less formal ‘phone conversations, and casual street-side chats. He also takes pains to present the history of the sorts of displays that are his subject. In addition, the volume includes numerous photographs of the sites in question, often taken by the author himself.<br />
As noted by another New Books in Folkore interviewee, Luisa Del Giudice, in her review for the Journal of American Folkore: &#8220;Sciorra has vividly demonstrated why the study and practice of such material culture is important and how individual human creativity informed by a spiritual and cultural core becomes an act of both personal and community identity. These art forms may not have much social capital, but Sciorra does. As Director of Academic and Cultural Programs at the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute of New York, editor (Italian American Review), blogger (&#8220;Joey Skee,&#8221; for i-Italy), noted scholar and cultural activist, Sciorra, through Built with Faith, will make a high impact beyond the disciplines of vernacular culture; art and architecture; migration and ethnic, urban, religious studies; and beyond New York City. This is definitely a carefully crafted work—that is, un lavoro ben fatto.&#8221;<br />
Cindy R. Lobel, writing for the Vernacular Architecture Forum’s Buildings and Landscapes journal, is similarly effusive: &#8220;Built with Faith makes a fine contribution to the literature on landscape, material culture, immigration, ethnic studies, and urban studies. It offers important information on the kinds of approaches Italian American New Yorkers have taken toward shaping the built environment of New York through their religious and cultural practices. Sciorra documents and offers wonderful thick descriptions of Italian American mat...]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Will the military background of Tulsi Gabbard and Tammy Duckworth lead them to a presidential nomination in 2020 or 2024? If the past is any guide, the answer is a strong maybe. More than half of presidential candidates across US political history have been veterans in some form, according to <a href="https://www.ramapo.edu/sshgs/faculty/jeremy-teigen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy M. Teigen</a>’s new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnIU0GMo57dHGfLZIApha88AAAFjNjrKEgEAAAFKAclV92U/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1439914362/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1439914362&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=NhhPdFzM3CCOBH3jAPdeHg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Veterans Run: Military Service in American Presidential Elections, 1789-2016</a> (Temple University Press, 2018).<br />
In the book, Teigen tracks eras in American political history to show the rising and falling success of military veterans in presidential politics. From Washington to Roosevelt to Eisenhower, there are many examples of successful military veterans; a paradox given the aversion to a close relationship between the military and civil government expressed clearly at the country’s founding. Parties seem to favor veterans, choosing a veteran as one of the two candidates in 60 percent of presidential races. Teigen unpacks these data and suggests why this has been the case in the past and what it portends for the future.<br />
Teigen is professor of political science at Ramapo College in New Jersey.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In this sweeping new biography, <a href="https://history.dartmouth.edu/people/colin-gordon-calloway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colin G. Calloway</a>, John Kimball Jr. 1943 Professor of History and Native American Studies at Dartmouth College, uses the prism of George Washington&#8217;s life to bring focus to the great Native leaders of his time&#8212;Shingas, Tanaghrisson, Bloody Fellow, Joseph Brant, Red Jacket, Little Turtle&#8212;and the tribes they represented: the Iroquois Confederacy, Lenape, Miami, Creek, Delaware; in the process, he returns them to their rightful place in the story of America&#8217;s founding. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrmK-uub4IRhGwN3OVn0MmAAAAFjNa0L8wEAAAFKAb_eWIE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190652160/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190652160&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=eyckRiXabkzF-nxrRrwKNw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Indian World of George Washington</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018) spans decades of Native American leaders&#8217; interactions with Washington, from his early days as surveyor of Indian lands, to his military career against both the French and the British, to his presidency, when he dealt with Native Americans as a head of state would with a foreign power, using every means of diplomacy and persuasion to fulfill the new republic&#8217;s destiny by appropriating their land. By the end of his life, Washington knew more than anyone else in America about the frontier and its significance to the future of his country.<br />
The Indian World of George Washington offers a fresh portrait of the most revered American and the Native Americans whose story has been only partially told. Calloway&#8217;s biography invites us to look again at the history of America&#8217;s beginnings and see the country in a whole new light.<br />

The book tracks the DeVos family’s accumulation of wealth through the multi-level marketing company Amway, which was founded by her Betsy DeVos’ father-in-law, and the family’s subsequent forays into philanthropy and Michigan Republican politics. Linkins offers a harsh assessment of her push for charter schools in Michigan, and argues she is determined to lower the firewall between church and state in America’s schools. He also explores her record in the federal government, contended she has sided with unscrupulous for-profit colleges and private student lenders at the expense of students. But while the public perception of DeVos is one of an incompetent, Linkins concludes DeVos is a savvy political operator with deep convictions who should not be underestimated.<br />

Truman.  Steven Ossad delivers a highly anticipated, “warts and all”, look at this important man and his legacy.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Linking a wide range of contexts, from intimate relationships to rapports between nation-states, Schulman highlights how negative in-group dynamics—organized around practices of group shunning, refusal of self-examination, and false loyalty that rejects accountability to others—become the “centerpiece of most social injustice”. Conflict is Not Abuse calls for us to interrupt and seek alternatives to escalation and violence by embracing mutual accountability and a sense of community responsibility for conflict resolution, rather than allowing the punitive state to act as the exclusive arbiter of conflict.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We all know baseball as one of America’s fondest pastimes, but did you know there’s a version of the sport designed specifically for the blind? It’s called Beep Ball, and the players, with the exception of the pitcher, are all visually impaired. Founded by the National Beep Ball Association in 1976, there are now more than 200 teams in the United States alone with interest in the sport growing quickly among players abroad.<br />
For his debut book of creative nonfiction, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qn927sL2dIm68ELgv9fhJaMAAAFjElNOOQEAAAFKAZb4POo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804011893/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0804011893&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=N9wnjCxE4HVdK3jS0wHdkw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beep: Inside the Unseen World of Baseball for the Blind</a> (Swallow Press, 2018), author <a href="http://www.davidwanczyk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Wanczyk</a> spent over three years interviewing dozens of Beep baseball players, coaches, volunteers, and fans in order to create a living profile of the sport and many of its star athletes.<br />
A diehard baseball fan himself, Wanczyk takes the reader deep into the culture of Beep Ball, traveling across the United States, Taiwan, and the Dominican Republic, to follow teams like the Austin Blackhawks, the Athens Timberwolves, the Indy Thunder, the Boston Renegades and Taiwan Homerun for a chance to hear their stories and share their passion for the sport with the world in one of the first-ever books written on contemporary Beep baseball.<br />
Here to discuss Beep on the New Books Network today, please welcome David Wanczyk.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Sabella was found guilty and became the first woman in Chicago sentenced to hang. Through meticulous research into court documents and other public records, Lucchesi shares the riveting narrative of Sabella’s case. Situating Sabella in the 1920s, and looking at the ways in which this case shows how the legal system set up to defend her failed Sabella at every turn, Lucchesi’s book walks readers through the trial where there was no evidence and no witnesses, but reporters and the jury knew one thing for certain, Sabella must be guilty: she was ugly. Describing how the press, judges, and juries decided the guilt or innocence of women based on their looks, Lucchesi examines how Sabella’s fellow inmates such as Beulah and Belva were able to charm their juries into acquitting them. She examines the role of Helen Cirese, the young lawyer who lead Sabella’s appeal giving her a jailhouse makeover in order to be more credible. Told with deep description, Ugly Prey makes sure that the story of Sabella Nitti is not lost. Instead, it is one that shows how the present day American justice system is not dissimilar to the system of the past in the ways that gender, class, and ethnicity are impact how individuals are treated throughout the justice system.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since 1945, the United States has lost every war it started. Why? A Vietnam War veteran, Tufts University Ph. D. and intimate of many of the leading figures in the American national security apparatus in the past forty-years, Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_K._Ullman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harlan Ullman</a>&#8216;s new book endeavors to find the answers to this most disturbing of queries. An in depth examination of American strategic and military decision-making since the Eisenhower era, Dr. Ullman shows the reader the flawed policy processes and decisions which made debacles such as Vietnam War, the Second Gulf War and the ongoing war in Afghanistan all too predictable. According to Dr. Ullman one answer to his query is simply that almost all presidents and administrations since 1960 have consistently failed to use sound strategic thinking and lacked sufficient knowledge or understanding of the circumstances prior to deciding whether or not to employ force.<br />
From John F. Kennedy to Donald Trump, from Vietnam to the war against ISIS, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlXcXmIrrQsWYJHlX6IXTs0AAAFjEeb6igEAAAFKAXCO3ts/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1682472256/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1682472256&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=E03QJZRUt7H1bBfn7GEkHg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anatomy of Failure: Why America Loses Every War It Starts</a> (Naval Institute Press, 2017) is in the words of Edward Luce of the Financial Times a must read book for anyone who wishes to find out why American foreign policy has in too many cases been a catalog of failure. All from the man who invented the concept of &#8216;Shock and Awe&#8217;.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The title of <a href="http://history.unc.edu/people/faculty/lisa-a-lindsay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lisa A. Lindsay</a>’s book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qr6GXKSjAAyKgowV2STgLoMAAAFjAaQMcgEAAAFKAZW1wBQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469631121/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469631121&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=G3ajAOgJRvPmkRJ566U9AQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlantic Bonds: A Nineteenth-Century Odyssey from America to Africa </a>(University of North Carolina Press, 2017),  invokes enduring family ties, as well as the connections between slavery, migration, and colonization in the Atlantic world of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br />
The book returns, again and again, to the theme of vulnerability as a consequence of the fragile freedoms of African Americans and Africans of the period, and charts the unusual story of two families – one African American and the other Nigerian – connected by a common ancestor, who have managed against significant odds, to keep in touch over many generations. The life story of one of the sons of Scipio Vaughan (the common ancestor), Churchwill Vaughan, forms the arc of Atlantic Bonds and traces, among other things, a “reverse migration” from South Carolina to West Africa.<br />
In the interview, Lisa Lindsay, discusses the ways in which this family was both typical and exceptional.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How does the portrayal of a character like Apu matter? What does the representation of South Asian TV characters tell us about society at large?  In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1498506585/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Asians on the U.S. Screen: Just Like Everyone Else?</a> (Lexington Books, 2018), <a href="http://www.bhoomikthakore.com/">Bhoomi Thakore</a> uses interviews and audience studies to explore these questions and more. By having participants list South Asian characters they’ve seen on TV, she learns a lot about representation in addition to the positive and negative characteristics attributed to these characters. Often times South Asians are relegated to minor characters in shows and Thakore explores how The Mindy Project breaks out of this mold. Exploring ideas and concepts including “forever foreigners,” assimilation, and acculturation, Thakore analyzes this media sociologically. The book also sheds light on the portrayal of South Asian female characters specifically, as well as how some shows emphasize the “every-day”-ness of some South Asian characters versus those portrayed as tokens. Overall, this work highlights important aspects that viewers of these shows may miss in passing. Thakore concludes by giving readers insights from the analysis at hand, but also provides larger insights in terms of racial relations and media portrayals in general.<br />
This book is interesting and accessible to a wide audience. Folks interested in general sociology, race/ethnicity, or media studies will find the book enjoyable. This book would be useful for an upper level sociology of race/ethnicity course as well as graduate level courses, especially those that focus on race/ethnicity or media studies.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today we are joined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Averell_Smith">Averell “Ace” Smith</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1496205499/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pitcher and the Dictator: Satchel Paige’s Unlikely Season in the Dominican Republic</a> (University of Nebraska Press, 2018). Smith is a political consultant and a lifelong baseball fan who became enamored with the game when he bought a copy of the 1956 edition of The Official Encyclopedia of Baseball at a school rummage sale. In a descriptive and richly detailed narrative, legendary pitcher Satchel Paige, along with several Negro League stars, are enticed to play in a tournament in the Dominican Republic. Paige, offered an eye-popping $30,000, is amazed by the lack of racial discord on the island, the relaxed baseball schedule and the ease in obtaining good food, wine and women. But there is a dark side. Paige is playing for Ciudad Trujillo in a tournament created to support and celebrate the “re-election” of the country’s ruthless dictator, Rafael Trujillo. And “El Jefe” does not like to lose. So, when Paige and his teammates struggle early in the tournament, Trujillo assigns the leader of his death squads to join team management. The message is clear: “You’d better win.” The all-stars do, by the barest margins, and Paige and his teammates return to the United States. Although they are banned from the Negro Leagues, a barnstorming tour is much more profitable. This book combines politics, racial issues and some of the best men who ever played the game.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://keishablain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keisha N. Blain</a> teaches African American and gender and women’s history at the University of Pittsburg. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812249887/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Set the World on Fire: Black Nationalist Women and the Global Struggle for Freedom</a> (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018) tells the story of an overlooked group of black women leaders in the aftermath of a declining Marcus Garvey’s black nationalist movement of the 1920s. Building on numerous religious and political ideologies, Garveyite women organized black workers from the Mississippi Delta to Harlem and built transnational alliances in the pursuit of global black liberation and nationalism. They followed strategies such the Greater Liberia Bill seeking funding from the U.S. government for black emigration to Africa. In doing so, they formed unlikely alliances and remained outside the established civil rights organizations tapping the frustrated aspirations of thousands of African Americans in mid-century America.  Over a period of four decades, they never gave up on their dream of a return to Africa and building a black nation recognized on the international stage.  Set the World on Fire, offers a continuous link between the nationalism of the Garvey movement and Black Power of the 1960s in which women were key.<br />

Goldberg contends that human nature is inherently tribal, and democracy and capitalism are unnatural. Therefore, maintaining those institutions requires effort. Goldberg’s narrative begins more than 10,000 years ago, before the agricultural revolution, and traces how Enlightenment principles were formed and eventually embraced by America’s founders. From there he argues that American ideals, including capitalism, defeated slavery and sparked an industrial revolution that alleviated poverty. He heavily criticizes early twentieth-century progressivism as antithetical to America’s founding principles, and sees twenty-first century identity politics contributing to tribalism among both liberals and conservatives, eroding democratic norms.<br />

Using an auto-ethnographic lens, Gennari explores this relationship, what he calls “the edge”, between the two cultures. Gennari examines the intersectionalities in music, film, sports, and foodways, spotlighting the edge as a way to highlight the ways in which the relationship between Italian American and African American cultures has been both joyous and beneficial as well as fraught with violence and suspicion. He posits that an Afro-Italian sensibility has vitalized American culture, even with the conflicts over urban spaces, political and personal respect, and overlapping histories of exclusion. Through his personal connections as well as critical and well-researched chapters on the intersections between these two cultures, Gennari gives readers a deeper understanding of the histories and relationships between African Americans and Italian Americans.<br />

Silverman</a> argues that Indian societies adopted firearm technology not because they were visually impressive or culturally significant (though they were both), but simply because they killed more efficiently. Using his concept of the “gun frontier,” Silverman, a professor of history at George Washington University, shows how contact between Natives and those Europeans willing to trade weapons for furs and other goods fundamentally altered the politics and power dynamics of a given region. Thundersticks draws on case studies from a broad sweep of time from the seventeenth to the mid-twentieth century, including the consolidation of Iroquois power, King Philip’s War, the otter fur trade in the Pacific Northwest, and the ascendency of the Blackfeet in the mountain west. Each story underscores the point that guns could both undermine colonial power as well as cause catastrophic conflict between Indian societies. Firearms changed Indian societies in innumerable ways, but when the gun trade lagged, so too did an individual polity’s power. Silverman’s book is a complicated, nuanced, look at how post-contact North America has long been a wildly interconnected place, and how it became a continent filled with blood and smoke.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[“What is needed now is not liberal reform or withdrawal, but a radical attack, a strategy of opposition. Scientific workers must develop ways to put their skills at the service of the people and against the oppressors.” (Zimmerman, et al. 1972).<br />
Following the 2014 conference, “Science for the People: The 1970s and Today,” <a href="http://sigridschmalzer.org/">Sigrid Schmalze</a><a href="http://sigridschmalzer.org/">r,</a> <a href="https://www.umass.edu/history/people/daniel-chard">Daniel Chard</a>, and <a href="https://histsci.fas.harvard.edu/people/alyssa-botelho">Alyssa Botelho</a>, edited a volume of the Science for the People (SftP) movement, curating numerous documents from the group that are as relevant today as when they were published several decades ago. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnmUi7PIoVwZCw3jC1eOyOYAAAFi7wNCyAEAAAFKAQ4sMLI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1625343183/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1625343183&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=hZq5WS-YA926D4JiB-IaoQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Science for the People: Documents from America’s Movement of Radical Scientists</a> (University of Massachusetts Press, 2018) encapsulates the diverse themes, research, and actions of the movement, which included chapters across the US at one time. Emerging from the radical political culture of the 1960s, and predecessor group, Scientists for Social and Political Action, SftP challenged the value-neutrality of science and technology, and instead sought to democratize science by engaging with other political movements and conducting research with non-experts. While much scientific research continues to be funded by the state or by corporations, SftP provided grassroots scientific and technological assistance and education in a multitude of settings. Just to take a few examples from the volume, these efforts included research for social movements, providing electrical power for a Black Panther free medical clinic, promoting the farming technique of intercropping, as well as distributing resources, literature and education to countries such as Vietnam and Nicaragua. The direction of assistance between SftP and other groups was rarely one-sided, as SftP members absorbed knowledge from other movements and places, as documented in the China: Science Walks on Two Legs selection, wherein several SftP members visited China and learned about some of the traditional science and peasant research conducted in the nation. In addition, through working groups and publications, SftP critiqued racist and sexist science, reductionist biology, nuclear power, weapons research, commercial agriculture, US imperialism, and much more. As their many articles and actions show, SftP did more than just critique mainstream science, they attempted to provide alternatives. Finally, SftP had a formative and lasting effect on Science and Technology Studies through its various studies on the social embeddedness of science and its political uses.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Colin Kaepernick’s refusal to stand for the national anthem in August 2016 prior to a preseason game reopened a national conversation about public performances of patriotism. What does a national anthem do to promote unity in a nation with a long running history of racial slavery, lynching, and segregation? <a href="http://aas.princeton.edu/p/iperry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imani Perry</a> answers this question in her recent book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QsTo1qF4_or5BRkuYwmacoQAAAFi2dtAyQEAAAFKAQ0iWkg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469638606/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469638606&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=7z3bRYB9SjTFiKKwm9fhXA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May We Forever Stand: A History of the Black National Anthem </a>(University of North Carolina Press, 2018). Through her history of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” Perry powerfully shows how and why throughout the Black liberation struggles in the twentieth and twenty-first century, Black Americans adopted the song as the &#8220;Black National Anthem.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What does it mean to say that a city can “die”? As <a href="https://www.northland.edu/dir/brian-tochterman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Tochterman</a> shows in this compelling intellectual and cultural history, motifs of imminent death—of a “Necropolis” haunting the country’s great “Cosmopolis”—have been a persistent feature of discourse on the probable fate of New York City since the Second World War. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qrr_TqyiOmSHQwTwDPYX2-8AAAFi2Y6RUQEAAAFKAeeHSqc/http://www.amazon.com/dp/146963306X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=146963306X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=zhyiLy1vzM35Lw92RsUyjw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dying City: Postwar New York and the Ideology of Fear</a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2017) traces this “spatial narrative” across many domains of thought and cultural production: fiction and essays, planning theory and practice, humanistic and social-scientific criticism in the public square, and film in the age of Charles Bronson’s Death Wish. Throughout, Tochterman shows that New York intellectuals of diverse political inflections have made specters of urban “ungovernability” central to how America and the world look at New York—whether to compel remedies, to render the city’s very chaos alluring, or, especially, to argue for the futility of intervention. Tochterman sheds new light on such figures as E. B. White, Mickey Spillane, Robert Moses, Jane Jacobs, Daniel Bell, Irving Howe, Lionel Abel, Michael Harrington, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Nathan Glazer, and John Lindsay, among other compass points in the urbanism and intellectual life of postwar New York. Between “Fun City” and “Fear City,” a new image of the metropolitan past, present, and future comes into focus.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sykes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charlie Sykes</a> had been a conservative in good standing for decades, hosting a popular Wisconsin talk radio show. But he found himself to be a man without a party after become a vocal opponent of Donald Trump in 2016. His attempt to understand what happened to conservatism culminated in his book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qm5ISWwzfkVV8uiYFM6o-DsAAAFi7ttv_QEAAAFKAf5SSbc/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250147174/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1250147174&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=0v0dC8rJn0bl4Md5fvee0g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How The Right Lost Its Mind</a> (St. Martin&#8217;s Press, 2017). Sykes takes a hard look at the ideological movement he thought he knew, and questions its acceptance of bigotry, falsehoods and conspiracy theories. He laments the role fellow radio hosts, especially Rush Limbaugh, played in abetting Trump’s rise, and pines for a figure like the late William F. Buckley who sought to insulate the conservatism from “crackpots.” And he recounts how his own opposition to Trump negatively impacted his career and led to his effective excommunication from the conservative community. Sykes ends with advice to like-minded “perplexed conservatives” on how to maintain their principles in the Trump Era.<br />

We return to the topic of health care this week. Jonathan Engel has recently written <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnKjdIukEViWEuIWJjhdptwAAAFizmoMuAEAAAFKAVESydg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0299314103/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0299314103&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=v7yLRy-4uIqdk-SQtkq80Q&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unaffordable: American Healthcare from Johnson to Trump</a> (University of Wisconsin Press, 2018). Engel is a professor in the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College and an adjunct professor of health policy and management at the Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University. In Unaffordable, we read a fifty-year history of the adoption of a variety of health care programs, from Medicare to Obamacare. Engel unravels the implications of health policy design for the delivery of services. He pays particular attention to the ways that health policy design have resulted in rising health care costs and the unaffordability of health care for many Americans.<br />

Black Christians were not the only ones involved in the black social gospel, though. <a href="https://utsnyc.edu/faculty/gary-dorrien-78/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rev.

Dorrien uses black social gospel to chart an intellectual and theological map of the tradition that gave birth to the leader of one of America’s most radical social movements: Dr. Martin Luther King.<br />

Readers are invited to ask what these collaborations that arise at the crossing points of various fields offer for engaging in reading and writing. Relying on an extensive overview of theoretical works that substantiate the overlapping of disciplines, <a href="https://cms.uni-konstanz.de/fileadmin/archive/litwiss-personen/detail-seite-fb-personal/petermann-emily-2325/10688/10575/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Petermann</a>’s research provides additional coordinates for the definition of intermediality that underpins her examination of novels that embrace music.<br />
As the title of the book suggests, Petermann considers multiple ways in which music is incorporated in literature: structure, performance, and reception. An extensive segment of this research is devoted to the discussion of musical structures that writers bring to their texts. In this regard, Petermann takes a step forward in the examination of music and literature collaborations. By emphasizing the significance of the musical structural component that informs a literary text, the book suggests a more profound dialogue between music and literature.<br />
The Musical Novel offers a detailed discussion of jazz elements that turn out to be effective for the organization of literary texts. Although this aspect has been previously discussed by scholars, Petermann focuses on the structural overlapping, drawing attention to improvisation elements. In this interview, Petermann specifies that despite the temptation to draw parallels between jazz and textual structuring, improvisation in literary texts, however, should be perceived as a metaphor. This comment invites the consideration of how musical and literary works affect both performance and reception.<br />
The Musical Novel contains a few chapters and subchapters that delve into a detailed analysis of Bach’s Goldberg Variations: Bach’s masterpiece appears rather productive for literary borrowings and variations at many levels, including structure and content. These chapters are particularly illuminating in terms of the dialogical opportunities that music and literature offer and welcome.<br />
Emily Petermann’s book offers an opportunity to explore new ways not only for reading and writing but also for teaching: one of the questions that this interview raises is how musical novel can be read and taught. The Musical Novel welcomes the expansion of the territory of interdisciplinary borrowings and collaborations.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How does the juvenile justice system impact the lives of the young people that go through it? In her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QguFf-OwGBmouDPXa86Fe6QAAAFiv81r8wEAAAFKARlwGrY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813570468/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0813570468&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=KtV45qyByB85.9VH9OhTEw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trapped in a Vice: The Consequences of Confinement for Young People</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2018), <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/coxal19809/alexandra-cox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandra Cox</a> uses interviews and ethnographic data to analyze the juvenile justice system and incarceration. While the book focuses specifically on New York&#8217;s justice system, the take-aways and Cox&#8217;s analyses are relevant for anyone interested in incarceration in general. Using the voices and experiences of those she interviews to articulate her findings, Cox points out that young people often suffer the most in systems of social inequality. She elaborates clearly on concepts and main take-aways through the book, from the idea that these young people are expected to mature within an institution, and how this impacts their development. Cox uses really powerful examples and pinpoints important concepts for us to think further about: the definition of worthiness (i.e. worthy of &#8220;saving&#8221;), being ungovernable (i.e. being uncontrollable), the idea of reformation systems as taking care of &#8220;other people&#8217;s children,&#8221; and the ethos of personal responsibly to youth who cannot even vote yet. The stories from the book show how it&#8217;s easy to get into trouble and very difficult to get out.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by Sociologists and Criminologists in general, but also by social workers, those working in the area of incarceration, in addition to anyone interested in developmental psychology within the context of incarceration. This book would be a great addition to any higher level undergraduate or entry level graduate course in criminology because of its clear organization and presentation of arguments.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Lawrence Halprin, one of the central figures in twentieth-century American landscape architecture, is well known to city-watchers for his work on San Francisco’s Ghirardelli Square, Seattle’s Freeway Park, downtown Portland’s open-space sequence, the FDR Memorial on the National Mall, and the California planned community of Sea Ranch. Less well known is his distinctive, process-based approach to design—his theoretical commitment, on the one hand, to a dynamic “choreography” of bodies moving through space, and, on the other, the visually arresting notational techniques of “scoring” he devised to represent such movement and carry out his projects in consultation with the public. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgiCpNTqYQlpvgCc7qjEzWEAAAFixVzymgEAAAFKAatjCew/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816679797/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0816679797&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wbhs2uY4ycZR2-1c8nKLnQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City Choreographer: Lawrence Halprin in Urban Renewal America</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2014), <a href="https://arch.usc.edu/faculty/alisonh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alison Bick Hirsch</a> addresses Halprin’s built work and community workshops in equal measure, pointing up important tensions that his participatory “Take Part Process” never quite extinguished: between manipulation and facilitation, universality and difference, conscious choice and emergent chance. Through Lawrence Halprin and his wife, the modern dancer Anna Halprin, Hirsch opens onto a broader history of postwar landscape and urban design, and onto some of the complicated politics in which proponents and critics of Urban Renewal alike found themselves immersed. Hirsch has written a decisive work that joins the intellectual, social, political, and aesthetic histories of urbanism. Geographers, historians, and urbanists of many stripes will learn from her able analysis.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Most everything Americans eat today comes out of cans. Some of it emerges from the iconic steel cylinders and much of the rest from the mammoth processed food empire the canning industry pioneered. Historian <a href="http://history.okstate.edu/9-people/68-zeide-anna">Anna Zeide</a>, in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpIIiGnRqSDdurI632G0LHIAAAFiq23eGAEAAAFKAX6tGZM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520290682/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520290682&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=eRYO7IuGE5EwDT.GD5g-UQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canned: The Rise and Fall of Consumer Confidence in the American Food Industry</a> (University of California Press, 2018), carefully traces how canners convinced a nation of consumers who ate little but seasonal, fresh food to dare to crack open an opaque container of unknown origins and put its contents into their bodies. The feat required reshaping everything from federal regulatory practices and the makeup of academic faculties to the way food was advertised and the genetic composition of peas. When the canning industry has seen its hard-won reputation for providing a wholesome staple of American pantries come under attack from consumer groups and environmentalists starting in the 1960s and 70s, it has doubled down on its techniques of obfuscation, brand burnishing, and regulatory capture. For those endeavoring to reform the American food system, the book is a sobering presentation of just what they are up against.<br />

One of the most prolific and iconoclastic commentators on American foreign policy currently active in American letters, Max Boot examines the life and career of General Edward Lansdale, in this detailed and quite personal biography. As he considers the various successes and failures of Lansdale&#8217;s professional life, as well as his role as the inspiration for some of the most telling fictional accounts of the Cold War in Southeast Asia, Boot also develops a context for counterinsurgency that positions strategic empathy as the most essential characteristic for its success. Yet the story of Lansdale&#8217;s life and career is also a riveting chapter in the great American tragedy that is the Vietnam War, one of which Boot offers an unvarnished and stark assessment.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Varzally adds to the growing literature on Southeast Asian Americans and on Asian international adoption by highlighting the distinctiveness of Vietnamese adoption for its liberal orientation and its expansive notion of kinship. Four chapters trace this history from its antiwar beginnings in the early Cold War; to Operation Babylift in 1975 and its controversial legal aftermath; to the federal legislation and social practices that shaped the &#8220;homecomings&#8221; of Amerasians in the 1980s; and, finally, to Vietnamese adoptees own attempts in the 1990s (and beyond) to find meaning in their journeys. Making ample use of oral history, Varzally tells stories that are both heart-rending and inspiring. They confirm that family formation was a central site of political contestation and protest in late twentieth-century America. Children of Reunion offers food for thought in contemporary debates over refugee resettlement and family reunification as a principle for immigration policymaking.<br />

Marcotte observes how Trump successfully positioned himself as a warrior against political correctness, while she also challenges the notion that liberals use allegations of bigotry to shut down dialogue. She charges that the infamous Access Hollywood tape did not derail the Trump campaign because sexual harassment is a form of trolling. And she argues that the troll mindset continues to shape how the Trump White House governs. Troll Nation explores several facets of the ongoing culture war, including race, gender guns and the environment. And the book discusses why trolls are attracted to conspiracy theories. Marcotte gives a bracing assessment of why the 2016 election did not turn out as many expected.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Amistad Rebellion is usually remembered as the only instance in which a US court sent re-captured slaves back to Africa. Yet as <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/faculty/sharla-fett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharla Fett</a> shows in her new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhhPGBAtL4TaZZItmmt2p18AAAFiqnYQ9QEAAAFKAd9HZV4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469630028/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469630028&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ELu47hkpI6lQ2JFmW0-QaQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recaptured Africans: Surviving Slave Ships, Detention, and Dislocation in the Final Years of the Slave Trade </a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2017), the Amistad case is not exactly unique. By using the stories of re-captured Africans in detention in places like Key West, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina, Dr. Fett examines how pro-slavery and abolitionist factions used re-captives to argue their respective cases. She also examines the lives of re-captured slaves sent to &#8220;back&#8221; to Liberia, a place they had never been.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How do students become LGBT activists at Christian Universities and Colleges? And what is the impact on the school but also on the activists themselves? In his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QucVUzGTl0MTNlpR9uLj0tAAAAFiqkjXQgEAAAFKATZAu4E/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469636220/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469636220&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=OdSYNEd8XjrPmEyHRS-Hww&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gay on God&#8217;s Campus: Mobilizing for LGBT Equality at Christian Colleges and Universities</a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2018), <a href="http://jonathancoley.com/">Jonathan S. Coley</a> uses interviews with LGBT activists on Christian campuses and other sources of data to answer these questions. LGBT activists in his study fall into three participant identities which tie to the &#8220;group ethos&#8221; he discovers. These typologies help to understand the ways in which students participate as activists but also how they come to know themselves. In addition, Coley situates his findings in the literature but also explains how his study differs and expands on previous findings. In general, he finds that &#8220;fit&#8221; is important to the activists and that only about a third of his participants fall into traditional definitions of activists. Coley also finds that denomination plays a key role in the development and reaction of activists groups on campus. Overall, this book gives a clear picture of LGBT activists on Christian university and college campuses.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by sociologists in general, but especially by those interested in social movements, religion, sexuality, and higher education. This book would be useful in a graduate level or higher level undergraduate social movements course given the clear organization of theory and examples used throughout the book and specifically in the tables.<br />

Aldrich is the Pfizer-Pratt University Professor of Political Science at Duke University; Griffin is associate professor of political science at the University of Colorado, Boulder.<br />
Why Parties Matter argues that competition between political parties is an essential component of a democracy. Competition facilitates responsiveness to citizens and a politics better able to address citizen concerns. Aldrich and Griffin follow the history of the parties in the United States through four eras&#8212;the Democratic&#8212;Whig party era that preceded the Civil War; the post-Reconstruction period; the Jim Crow era; and the modern era. They show the emergence of competition between the parties and when it succeeded and failed.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Daniel Bessner&#8217;s <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/daniel-bessner-democracy-in-exile-hans-speier-and-the-rise-of-the-defense-intellectual-cornell-up-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy in Exile: Hans Speier and the Rise of the Defense Intellectual </a>(Cornell University Press, 2018) provides a fascinating account of Hans Speier, an oft forgotten yet highly influential figure within the mid-century national security state. Speier, a Weimar emigre intellectual, conducted propaganda for the United States in both the Second World War and the Cold War, and helped build the institutional infrastructure of the so-called military-intellectual complex. This book is more than a biography of a single person, however. It also traces the rise of a new kind of person: the defense intellectual. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Speier and other defense intellectuals, including Henry Kissinger, George Kennan, and Walt Rostow, elevated the influence of experts and even transformed the way U.S. foreign policy was made.<br />
With Speier at its center, Democracy in Exile makes critical interventions into many debates, such as the role of crises in democracy, the Cold War&#8217;s origins and, perhaps most importantly for us today, the proper place of experts in society and government. (In regard to that last debate, see also Bessner and Stephen Wertheim&#8217;s Foreign Affairs article &#8220;<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-05/democratizing-us-foreign-policy">Democratizing U.S. Foreign Policy</a>.&#8221;)<br />

Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy hosted America&#8217;s leading scientists, writers, activists, and thinkers to honor 49 Nobel Prize Winners. With guests such as American hero and astronaut John Glenn, Linus and Ava Helen Pauling who had picketed the White House prior to the dinner, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and writers including Pearl Buck, John Dos Passos, Robert Frost, and James Baldwin the dinner served as one of the most important nights in the White House.<br />
Esposito positions readers in the political climate of the time and shares a glimpse into a political climate where intellectuals and immigrants were honored, and even those with political differences could come together to honor one another for one night. Well researched, Esposito&#8217;s work gives a fascinating glimpse not only into a single night at the White House, but also a snapshot into the world of a number of the important and influential minds of the early 1960s. He shows us how this impressive gathering not only honored these important thinkers, but also created relationships and friendships for years to come.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When thinking of Title IX, most people immediately associate this important education policy with either athletics or a general idea of increasing opportunities for women in education. Rarely do those same people know how Title IX originated, how the role of Title IX changed over time, and how it contributes to what <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/r-shep-melnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R. Shep Melnick</a> calls &#8220;the Civil Rights State.&#8221; During the Obama and Trump administrations, Title IX has been involved with the recent attention that universities&#8212;and society writ large&#8212;have given to sexual assault and sexual harassment. As the public has demanded action to solve this issue in education, how to regulate this action through Title IX has proved to be a more difficult and controversial task.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Many of us move to a new place at some point in our lives for a variety of reasons: for a job, to be with a partner, to attend school, for a change of scenery, to retire. When we have a choice, we consider a host of place characteristics to make a decision on where to go: its cost of living, crime rate, climate, array of &#8220;qualities&#8221; (life, schools, housing), amenities. And, we often assume that when we get there we will either always &#8220;be ourselves&#8221; or reinvent ourselves, and become a new person. Little do we know that our identities&#8212;how we think about and perform them&#8212;are more out of our control in new environments than we ever would have thought and could never have planned. In her provocative new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvE9DAqAN0dd5a-A9L2NTFUAAAFioY65dgEAAAFKAT53tsk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022636125X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022636125X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=MRm8E5U9t5xExLSwsyL2RQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Places Make Us: Novel LBQ Identities in Four Small Cities</a>, sociologist <a href="http://www.bu.edu/sociology/faculty-staff/faculty/japonica-brown-saracino/">Japonica Brown-Saracino</a> challenges the idea that we always possess a &#8220;core self&#8221; wherever we go. By examining lesbian, bisexual, and queer (LBQ) women in four cities around the U.S. (Ithaca, NY; San Luis Obispo, CA; Portland, ME; and Greenfield, MA), she strikingly finds homogeneity in terms of how people self-identify within places, but heterogeneity across places despite both the cities and people being similar. Brown-Saracino discovers that these women adopt distinct local &#8220;sexual identity cultures&#8221; that are shaped by elements in each place&#8217;s ecology, specifically how they perceive the abundance and acceptance there of others like them, the city&#8217;s narratives about itself, and the types of women like them that they meet. Most importantly, how they arrange and act out these identities are often very different from how they did so before they moved there. Featuring a rigorous analysis and compelling presentation, this book forces us to rethink what we know about the identities we hold, the communities we belong to, and the places where we live.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What if modern conservatism is less a reaction to environmentalism than a mutation of it? Historian <a href="http://cola.siu.edu/history/faculty-and-staff/faculty/zaretsky.php">Natasha Zaretsky&#8217;</a>s latest book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qh0WndTOCk3pUlBESbuEf00AAAFim8RcWgEAAAFKAVwgghE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231179812/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0231179812&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=QKJJhFSzV-NdrBHoMzvI3g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radiation Nation: Three Mile Island and the Political Transformation of the 1970s</a> (Columbia University Press, 2018), is a fine-grained examination of the local reaction to the most serious accident in the history of U.S. nuclear energy. It is also a sweeping study of the construction of arguments for and against nuclear energy and atomic weapons from the end of the World War II to the present. Zaretsky follows that debate through a transformative six-year debate in central Pennsylvania, where conservative activists launched protests that drew heavily from the examples of environmentalism, the antiwar movement, second-wave feminism, the black freedom struggle, and black and women&#8217;s health activism. Yet rather than pushing them to the left, their fight with pronuclear forces in industry and government made them more conservative. They articulated an ethnonationalist argument about a threatened nation betrayed by its leaders and illustrated it with ecological images of the damaged bodies of mothers, babies, and the unborn. This &#8220;biotic nationalism&#8221; helped conservatives paint a convincing picture of the America of the 1970s and 1980s and remains potent today, as visible in the &#8220;Crippled America&#8221; described by Donald Trump.<br />
Natasha Zaretsky is associate professor of history at Southern Illinois University. She is the author of No Direction Home: The American Family and the Fear of American Decline, 1968-1980 (UNC Press, 2007) and co-editor of Major Problems in U.S. History Since 1945 (4th ed., Cengage, 2013). Her articles have appeared in Diplomatic History, The Journal of Social History, The Journal of Women&#8217;s History, The New Republic, and elsewhere.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://sipa.columbia.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/alexander-hertel-fernandez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexander Hertel-Fernandez</a> is the author of<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiAd2g46HV0b5A38f7strnAAAAFim4FW3QEAAAFKAQWeFYE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190629894/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190629894&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=XqAAAchcGV2Jbt2P8cY6Kg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Politics at Work: How Companies Turn Their Workers into Lobbyists</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018). He is an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University.<br />
We often think of corporate political power expressed in campaign donations, political advertising, and lobbying. Darrell West, Ray LaRaja and Brian Schaffner, and Erica Fowler have all been on the podcast in the past to talk about this side of money and politics. Hertel-Fernandez is focused elsewhere to discover how companies influence politics. He sets his sights on the internal politicking that companies engage in with their own employees. Through rigorous surveys and interviews, he discovers that a quarter of American employees have experienced some type of political influence from their employer, including encouragements to register to vote and pressure to vote for favored candidates. And once contacted by an employer, many employees feels pressured to act, sometimes out of fear of retribution, docked pay, or dismissal from the job. While this is hardly a brand new corporate tactic, Hertel-Fernandez explains how it has grown since the 1990s and also why this is a worrisome trend for the democracy and employees.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

An imperialistic and ethnocentric project inspired by religion in the late nineteenth century resulted in a missionary cosmopolitanism instrumental in shaping U.S. policy toward Asia in the twentieth. The missionary effort evolved from a religious one to secular service projects offering a model for foreign aid and cross-cultural engagement. Missionaries from liberal denominations, inspired by the social gospel and with language and cultural skills, were a primary source of information about foreign peoples. As an influential group of children of missionaries, returning to secular educations and careers at home, shaped American culture and politic through popular writing, scholarship on foreign lands, and diplomatic service. Hollinger has shed significant light on a group of Americans who have been largely ignored in the development of America&#8217;s relationship to the world.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As immigration from Mexico to the United States grew through the 1970s and 1980s, the Border Patrol, police, and other state agents exerted increasing violence against ethnic Mexicans in San Diego&#8217;s volatile border region. In response, many San Diego activists rallied around the leadership of the small-scale print shop owner Herman Baca in the Chicano movement to empower Mexican Americans through Chicano self-determination. The combination of increasing repression and Chicano activism gradually produced a new conception of ethnic and racial community that included both established Mexican Americans and new Mexican immigrants. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjHOk-K-CdPlyf6OLVjqMJEAAAFiZGpM9gEAAAFKATzz3OI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469635569/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469635569&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=17e6HFiG4C7HMIjwCu8-uw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raza Si, Migra No: Chicano Movement Struggles for Immigrant Rights in San Diego</a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2017), Jimmy Patino narrates the rise of this Chicano/Mexicano consciousness and the dawning awareness that Mexican Americans and Mexicans would have to work together to fight border enforcement policies that subjected Latinos of all statuses to legal violence.<br />
By placing the Chicano and Latino civil rights struggle on explicitly transnational terrain, Patino fundamentally reorients the understanding of the Chicano movement. Ultimately, Patio tells the story of how Chicano/Mexicano politics articulated an abolitionist position on immigration&#8211;going beyond the agreed upon assumptions shared by liberals and conservatives alike that deportations are inherent to any solutions to the still burgeoning immigration debate.<br />

In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QmRaRXoEGNchBzuIooU6IbQAAAFiggh-2AEAAAFKAdt-Eqo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520291344/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520291344&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=aohaCU0kpVQtdkic4TFJqw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Myth of Silent Spring: Rethinking the Origins of American Environmentalism</a> (University of California Press, 2018), historian <a href="https://www.uml.edu/FAHSS/History/faculty/montrie-chad.aspx">Chad Montrie</a> insists that environmental consciousness has been present in the United States since its founding, and that it could be found in places and among people overlooked by Rachel Carson and legions of journalists, historians, and activists in her time and our own. In this, his fourth book working to push the perspectives of social and labor history to the foreground in the grand narrative of American&#8217;s relationship with the natural world, Montrie draws on his own research and synthesizes a generation of scholarship to show how a diverse cast of characters&#8212;from Lowell mill girls to United Auto Workers executive Olga Madar, from migrant farm laborers in California to Slovenian immigrants in Minnesota, from coal miners fighting black lung to urban residents fighting lead poisoning, and others&#8212;perceived industrialization as a threat to their health and quality of life. This inclusive, revisionist history challenges us to rethink the causes, geography, chronology, and content of American environmentalism.<br />
Chad Montrie is Professor of History at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell and the author of The Myth of Silent Spring, A People&#8217;s History of Environmentalism in the United States, Making a Living: Work and Environment in the United States, and To Save the Land and People: A History of Opposition to Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today we are joined by <a href="https://www.amybass.net/">Amy Bass</a>, author of the book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qmb9e4hHIm1F_MbDBs2DDpQAAAFigWrDsgEAAAFKAa_sSic/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316396540/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0316396540&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=.DjXD5PmqghfB6VigNq4pA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Goal: A Coach, A Team, and the Game that Brought a Divided Town Together</a> (Hachette Books, 2018). This is the fourth book for Bass, who is director of the honors program and a professor of history at the College of New Rochelle in New York. One Goal is the story of a high school soccer team in Lewiston, Maine, that helped bring together a racially divided city. Lewiston, overwhelmingly white, became the home base for thousands of Somali refugees. Longtime residents of Lewiston were uncomfortable with people whose language, religion and customs were markedly different. A popular saying in Maine was &#8220;You&#8217;re always from away,&#8221; and yet Lewiston&#8217;s citizens were having trouble adjusting to this latest group of immigrants from far away. Enter longtime Lewiston High School soccer coach Mike McGraw, who saw the potential in the young Somalis playing in pickup games in the city. Molding the group into a cohesive unit, McGraw and his squad weathered racial taunts from opponents and a less-than-ringing endorsement from Lewiston&#8217;s mayor to bring an elusive soccer state championship to a traditionally hockey-mad area. Bass shows how trust, faith, hard work and some uncanny soccer ability helped bring glory and pride to a town that still struggles with coexistence between very different cultures.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Native American&#8221; is unique among American racial categories in defining not just social status or historical lineage, but also an individual&#8217;s relationship to state and federal governments. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvAwoWoFL7es-v5puXm9I9kAAAFifI0J6wEAAAFKAbHGlUw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190619465/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190619465&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=CLibntXbb.hjnETnEgcYTA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who Belongs?: Race, Resources, and Tribal Citizenship in the Native South </a>(Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="https://history.olemiss.edu/mikaela-m-adams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikaela M. Adams</a>, an assistant professor of history at the University of Mississippi, tracks the histories of six Indian societies in the American South from the seventeenth to the twenty first centuries. In doing so, she argues that the question of belonging was often difficult to answer, particularly in a region where whites insisted on dividing the individuals along a strict, binary, color line. In Who Belongs?, Pamunkey, Catawba, Choctaw, Cherokee, Seminole, and Miccosukee communities all grapple with the fundamental question of tribal membership. After colonization and conquest, the answer to the question posed by Adams could have critical and concrete consequences. Often, whether someone belonged to a given tribe determined fundamental questions of identity, financial restitution, and land ownership. Who Belongs? is a critical retelling of the Native south which emphasizes the fungible nature of group identity and the adaptations Native communities made to survive within a settler colonial system of state power.<br />

From all accounts, the 2016 election was unusual, and the role of political communication was no different.<br />
Using a variety of methods, the chapter authors examine how rhetoric and political communication shaped the tone of campaigns and ultimate outcomes of the election. They study how candidates primed voters for an anti-establishment candidate. They also examine how political communication influenced key campaign issues such as climate change, immigration, national security, religion, and gender.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[With the railroad&#8217;s arrival in the late nineteenth century, immigrants of all colors rushed to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands, transforming the region into a booming international hub of economic and human activity. Following the stream of Mexican, Chinese, and African American migration, <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/2689451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julian Lim</a> presents a fresh study of the multiracial intersections of the borderlands, where diverse peoples crossed multiple boundaries in search of new economic opportunities and social relations. However, as these migrants came together in ways that blurred and confounded elite expectations of racial order, both the United States and Mexico resorted to increasingly exclusionary immigration policies in order to make the multiracial populations of the borderlands less visible within the body politic, and to remove them from the boundaries of national identity altogether.<br />
In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qlb0UInSjYHOAZKrz-xU4lcAAAFiZDg5egEAAAFKARUByso/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469635496/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469635496&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=K2mlHP38wA4vwXYbRRXXOw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Porous Borders: Multiracial Migrations and the Law in the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands</a> (UNC Press, 2017), Lim reveals how a borderlands region that has traditionally been defined by Mexican-Anglo relations was in fact shaped by a diverse population that came together dynamically through work and play, in the streets and in homes, through war and marriage, and in the very act of crossing the border.<br />
Julian Lim is an Assistant Professor of History at Arizona State University. She holds a B.A. in literature and a law degree from U.C. Berkeley, and received her Ph.D. in History from Cornell University. Trained in history and law, she focuses on immigration, borders, and race, and has taught in both history department and law school settings.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Not all city dwellers are bipedal, according to Frederick L. Brown, author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrlaataMGfrhA-tH_CAQ7OYAAAFibLxJzwEAAAFKAVJeITI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0295999349/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0295999349&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=mLBFtMtNQ.tR.ZltR7sCmQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The City is More Than Human: An Animal History of Seattle</a> (University of Washington Press, 2016). The history of Seattle, and all cities, is as much about its non-human inhabitants as its human ones, argues Brown, an independent scholar working on a contractual basis with the National Park Service. Salish-speaking people, the earliest inhabitants of the Puget Sound, had myriad relationships with animals. They thought of them as important symbols and as spiritual guides, and used them as a critical resource base. The species of animals living around the Puget Sound changed with European arrival and conquest, but the complicated relationships they had with humans did not. Cattle, horses, mountain lions, dogs, and salmon, all meant different things to different people at different times. Brown tracks these changes in use and attitude and argues that our perception of animals is shaped by the paradox of the pet food dish. The bowl we put out for our cats and dogs, Brown says, is an enduring symbol of our fraught relationship to creatures we by turns, eat, ignore, or love, depending on the context and the species in question. The history of the human city is indeed much more than a human history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today we are joined by <a href="https://www.davidrapp.co/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Rapp</a>, author of the book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgdZGHtj6ha4-893DCqK-1QAAAFicuj8qQEAAAFKAYlx50o/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022641504X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022641504X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Ieeu755thkwRpQdCQh074A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tinker to Evers to Chance: The Chicago Cubs and the Dawn of Modern America</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2018). Rapp spent 30 years as a journalist in the Washington. D.C., area and was the former editor of Congressional Quarterly, where he oversaw that publications transition from print to digital publishing. Rapp blows the dust off the legends of the Chicago Cubs&#8217; iconic double play combination of the early 20th century: shortstop Joe Tinker, second baseman Johnny &#8220;The Crab&#8221; Evers, and first baseman Frank &#8220;The Peerless Leader&#8221; Chance. They formed the foundation of a National League juggernaut that won four pennants, two World Series and a major-league record for victories in a season. Rapp humanizes all three men, showing how they survived during a rough-and-tumble era of baseball that was undergoing a transition&#8212;just like the United States was at the turn of the century. Each man brought a distinctive local culture with him to Chicago: Tinker was an urbanite from Kansas City; Evers hailed from the heavily Irish-American city of Troy, New York; and Chance traveled east from the laid-back Central Valley of California. All three men were intense&#8212;Tinker and Evers had several fights and never spoke to one another off the field&#8212;but they proved that teammates with a common goal do not have to like one another.<br />

In her new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qib3O9n3dAVVAcsfipoFMGYAAAFiUyyT4gEAAAFKASBCR8w/http://www.amazon.com/dp/081359314X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=081359314X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=0rAnBHTpiQaZdcS3Tkd6vw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Going Viral: Zombies, Viruses, and the End of the World </a>(Rutgers University Press, 2018), <a href="http://thisisdahlia.com/">Dahlia Schweitzer</a> brings them together as she explores the outbreak narrative in popular film, television and other media. Examining the outbreak narrative in popular culture, Schweitzer traces the film cycle of the outbreak narrative as it plays out in the themes of globalization, terrorism, and the end of civilization. Schweitzer explores how popular cultural narratives in additional to official media sources heighten and perpetuate the fears created through the outbreak narrative. Although we leave in a world that is far safer today than most any time in history, the outbreak narrative as it is structured in popular culture creates a pattern of fear and conspiracy theories that are representative of larger societal panics. Well researched and covering a wide array of film, television, and other media that address the outbreak narratives, Schweitzer&#8217;s book is a must read for individuals interested in a sociological read of the ways film and television illustrate larger, global concerns.<br />

Native Space explores these acts as everyday cultural practices, and also examines how settler societies deploy the concept of Indian-ness to create colonial geographies. Barnd takes an interdisciplinary approach toward these subjects, and examines these concepts through the use of demographic and cartographic data, stories, and imagery, each of which underscores the different methods Native peoples use to unsettle settler society and reclaim Indigenous spaces.<br />

Zeitz challenges the conservative critique of the Great Society as ineffectual, and also argues that the ideological approach of the Johnson administration was more moderate pragmatism than left-wing radicalism. Regardless of the reader&#8217;s political outlook, Building the Great Society provides an essential understanding into how this enormously consequential period of American history came to be.<br />

Goldberg shows for example how inherited schemas, which had historically painted Jews as both backwards &#8220;Orientals&#8221; and, at the same time, as ultra-modern cosmopolitans, were mobilized consciously and unconsciously to serve different sociological theories. That is, as Goldberg illustrates, because of their contradictory and ambivalent status within the European imagination, the Jew became a central object of study and a key symbol for social theorists, a symbol that they found useful for thinking through the contradictions and ambivalences of nationhood and citizenship in France, economics and power in Germany, and urbanization and assimilation in the United States. As Goldberg writes, in a phrase borrowed from Claude Levi-Strauss, &#8220;Jews were good to think.&#8221;<br />
In this episode, we talk about Durkheim&#8217;s reactions to the reactionary right, and how his view about Jews may have informed other aspects of his thought; we talk about the Chicago schools idea of assimilation, which, as Goldberg argues, begins with recognizing the &#8220;marginal man&#8221; as a key character of the Modern era and ends with a vision of diversity and collaboration; we talk about the two different ways Karl Marx depicted Jews and their relationship to capital and to European history; and we talk about how the Jew or rather, the figure of the Jew continues to serve &#8220;as an intermediary for self-reflection in our own time.&#8221;<br />

Whether through stories of police brutality, Confederate iconography, riots over integration, or the rise of Ku Klux Klan, Butler&#8217;s work demonstrates that even Southern Florida was not spared the racial violence endemic in other states of the South.<br />

Building upon established arguments that state-sponsored multiculturalism at home justifies imperialism abroad and that state-assigned ethnic identities in Southeast Asia are vestiges of colonial pluralism, Patterson studies minor literatures of the Transpacific as a mode of creative response to pluralist govermentality. In examining these cultural communities, he finds an alternative politics of identity in their literature that express a motif of &#8220;transition.&#8221; Engaging in these ceaseless processes of transition, which Patterson dubs &#8220;Transitive Cultures,&#8221; enables individuals to maintain mobility in hyper-controlled spaces. Instead of using a national paradigm, such as &#8220;Asian-American literature,&#8221; Patterson uses the term &#8220;Transpacific Anglophone literature&#8221; to describe English-language texts from Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines as well as those written by Southeast Asian migrants to Hawaii, Canada, and the mainland United States. He uses this label to emphasize the encounter and exchange that typifies transitive culture, and to stress the ideology of linguistic identities. This genealogy of an under-appreciated literary tradition explores transitive cultures in metahistorical novels, travel narratives, and in non-realist genres and offers a border-crossing method for conceptualizing and reading literature that purposefully elides multicultural categorizations.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

She is an assistant professor of public policy and political science at Duke University.<br />
Citizens by Degree examines the development and impact of federal higher education policy, specifically the National Defense Education Act, the Higher Education Act, and Title IX. Rose argues that these policies have been an overlooked-factor driving the progress that women have made in the United States. By significantly expanding women&#8217;s access to college, they led to women to surpassing men as the recipients of bachelor&#8217;s degrees, while also empowering them to become more economically successful and politically engaged. The book focuses on how Southern Democrats shaped U.S. higher policy development during the mid-twentieth century, expanding opportunities for women, while maintaining discriminatory practices for African Americans.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.<br />
As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.<br />

That conviction drives <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnHoZVziREjqRREnP0WuVTYAAAFiUm4FeQEAAAFKASgQh4E/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807167746/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0807167746&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ddsIExFtULhX7bkdbtV6Iw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Fever, Race, and Ecology in Nineteeth-Century New Orleans</a> (LSU Press, 2017) by historian <a href="http://www.murraystate.edu/academics/CollegesDepartments/CollegeOfHumanitiesAndFineArts/History/contact/urmiengineer.aspx">Urmi Engineer Willoughby</a>. Much more than a history of mosquitoes and scientists, the book attends to ecology, economy, and culture to explore how yellow fever arrived in the Gulf South, why yellow fever epidemics became commonplace in the Crescent City, why they finally abated, and how residents made sense of the disease. Willoughby finds answers in landscapes: the contours of sugarcane plantations, the sprawl of a city brimming with global capital, the severed connections of a military occupation, the new rural railroad network of the postbellum South, the urban zones of public health interventions, and the massive plantations and infrastructure that followed imperial expansion across the hemisphere. Within these places, the notions of racial, ethnic, and geographic otherness permeating theories about susceptibility to yellow fever echoed broader social and political discourse. Both local and transnational, this study presents the spread of yellow fever as an unintended consequence of colonial and imperial development and raises important questions about our approach to controlling epidemic diseases today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Chef <a href="http://sioux-chef.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Sherman</a>, Oglala Lakota and originally from Pine Ridge Reservation, has become one of the most important voices in the Indigenous foods revitalization movement. By researching in the archives, visiting elders, and experimenting with new uses for traditional ingredients and techniques, he has created a new vision for modern Native American cuisine. That vision is realized in<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpJQD8xqeIvvY_qTBjBv-zYAAAFiNhg1mwEAAAFKASLt1e8/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816699798/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0816699798&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=gie2TqvxjYeB7WP-gkbX1A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sioux Chef&#8217;s Indigenous Kitchen</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2017). Particularly making use of the traditional foods of Minnesotan tribal peoples, his company <a href="http://sioux-chef.com/">The Sioux Chef</a> and the related non-profit North American Traditional Food Systems (<a href="https://www.natifs.org">NATIFS</a>) have now released their first cookbook with the University of Minnesota Press, described as follows: &#8220;Sherman dispels outdated notions of Native American fare&#8212;no fry bread or Indian tacos here&#8212;and no European staples such as wheat flour, dairy products, sugar, and domestic pork and beef. The Sioux Chef&#8217;s healthful plates embrace venison and rabbit, river and lake trout, duck and quail, wild turkey, blueberries, sage, sumac, timpsula or wild turnip, plums, purslane, and abundant wildflowers. Contemporary and authentic, his dishes feature cedar braised bison, griddled wild rice cakes, amaranth crackers with smoked white bean paste, three sisters salad, deviled duck eggs, smoked turkey soup, dried meats, roasted corn sorbet, and hazelnut-maple bites.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When the state takes over, can local democracy survive? Over 100 school districts have been taken over by state governments since the late 1980s. In doing so, state officials relieve local officials, including those elected by local residents, of the authority to operate public schools. In cities with an increasingly powerful group of African-American leaders, a state takeover has the potential to roll-back gains in descriptive representation and democratic governance.<br />
How this has played out is the purpose of <a href="https://domingomorel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Domingo Morel</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QtFRZCUdxMA7G4uUGNEW2PgAAAFiNgLq_AEAAAFKAVEK4Mk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190678984/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190678984&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=SeRLu16gB30Otp1hW8NNIQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Takeover: Race, Education, and American Democracy</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018). Morel focuses on two cities, Central Falls, RI and Newark, NJ, as well as original quantitative data from cities across the country. What he discovers is a very real threat to local democracy, but one that has played out different ways. The case of Newark differs greatly from Central Falls, and Morel shows what we can learn about racial and ethnic politics by focusing on the changing ways that schools are operated.<br />
Morel is assistant professor of political science at Rutgers University, Newark.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Petersen</a>, Professor of International and American Diplomatic History at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, studies the final wars on the prairie from the Native American perspective in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkFC40v-QxUJJx0lEGXvIeQAAAFiMBP5MwEAAAFKASQUJ0M/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1845198018/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1845198018&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=i.yt2g2Pr3RHr8nbnnduWQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Military Conquest of the Prairie: Native American Resistance, Evasion and Survival, 1865-1890 </a> (Sussex Academic Press, 2016). When the reservation system took hold about one-third of tribes stayed permanently there, one-third during the harsh winter months, and the last third remained on what the government termed un-ceded territory, which Native Americans had the right to occupy by treaty. For the Federal government it was completely unacceptable that some Indians refused to submit to its authority. Both the Red River war (1874-75) in the south and the great Sioux war (1876-77) in the north were the direct result of Federal violation of treaties and agreements. At issue was the one-sided violence against free roaming tribes that were trying to maintain their old way of life, at the heart of which was avoidance on intermingling with white men.<br />
Contrary to the expectations of the government, and indeed to most historical accounts, the Native Americans were winning on the battlefields with clear conceptions of strategy and tactics. They only laid down their arms when their reservation was secured on their homeland, thus providing their preferred living space and enabling them to continue their way of life in security. But white-man perfidy and governmental double-cross were the order of the day. The Federal government found it intolerable that what it termed &#8220;savages&#8221; should be able to determine their own future. Vicious attacks were initiated in order to stamp out tribalism, resulting in driving the US aboriginal population almost to extinction. Analysis of these events is discussed in light of the passing of the Dawes Act in 1887 that provided for breaking up the reservations to the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 that gave a semblance of justice to Native Americans.<br />

Benjamin Lay lived and proclaimed a life dedicated to the immediate abolition of slavery over a century before many of the women and men aforementioned were either born or first proclaimed abolition as their chosen lifework. Many characteristics described Benjamin Lay: Quaker, dwarf, vegetarian, cave-dweller, sailor, farmer, or anti-capitalist; all of them informed his personal interpretation of militant and revolutionary abolitionism.<br />

G. Hopkins</a>, Professor Emeritus of Commonwealth History at the University of Cambridge, one of the foremost historians of the 19th- and 20th-century British Empire, engages in the fraught, but little studied subject of why and how the &#8216;American Empire&#8217; differs if at all, from its British progenitor. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpkaYcBEX5FGqswwWlWPzGwAAAFiKrF5aAEAAAFKAWA5qvA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691177058/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0691177058&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=SSKDsbvj5lvO3kKhLcCaCw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Empire: A Global History</a> (Princeton University Press, 2018)&#8212;a book of enormous sweep, ranging widely from the mid-18th century to the present day&#8212;Professor Hopkins introduces the reader into an exploration as to the issues of continuity versus discontinuity in British, Imperial and American history, as well as the intersection of empire with Globalization in its various incarnations historically. This is a book which demolishes the time-worn and artificial separation of American history post-1783 from British and indeed Global History. In short, Professor Hopkins&#8217; study is an extremely important book; every historian of whatever specialization should invest the necessary time and attention to read and study it at length.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Voting rights are always in the news in American politics, and recent court decisions and an upcoming election in 2018 make this especially true today. Most discussions come back to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) and whether it will continue to provide the voting rights protections it has in the past.<br />
In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qiubaj_8lRxaJCeWkT9Nl50AAAFiEJi39gEAAAFKAbrdYHg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1503603512/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1503603512&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=uJHcmREqkI3K4I2hWVrA-g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ballot Blocked: The Political Erosion of the Voting Rights Act </a>(Stanford University Press, 2017), <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/people/jesse-rhodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesse Rhodes</a>, associate professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, places the VRA into a political context. He aims to figure out the political puzzle of the VRA: Why, for fifty years, have both Democrats and Republicans in Congress consistently voted to expand the protections offered by the VRA, yet the act remains vulnerable? Why have Republicans consistently adopted administrative and judicial decisions that undermine legislation they repeatedly back?<br />
Rhodes argues that conservatives have pursued a paradoxical strategy which takes advantage of high and low salience. The conservative strategy, according to Rhodes, is to accept expansive voting rights protections in highly visible votes in Congress while simultaneously narrowing the scope of federal enforcement in low visibility administrative and judicial maneuvers.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Lewis chafes at the populist, protectionist and nativist elements that have come to dominate the Republican Party, and argues that conservatives need to reacquaint themselves with the intellectual foundation of their own movement. He argues that many have overlooked how Ronald Reagan&#8217;s success flowed from his intellectual grounding and cosmopolitan nature. Outlandish conservative media figures who peddle outrageous ideas solely to make a buck attract Lewis&#8217; ire, as he charges them with dumbing down their shared ideology. Lewis also tracks how an influx of southerners and evangelicals into the Republican Party created challenges that pulled the party away from traditional conservatism. Overall, Lewis presents an unvarnished yet constructive critique designed to create a conservative movement that can thrive in the twenty-first century.<br />

Hernandez</a> have produced the first anthology to focus on the scholarship and experiences of 1.5 and second -generation Central American migrants to the United States. Consisting of nine interdisciplinary essays, the volume challenges and complicates the ever-budding field of Latina/o Studies by disrupting chronologies, theories, and narratives that fail to account for the diverse experiences of isthmian migrants. Analyzing oral history, cultural celebrations, literature, art, and the use of public space, the contributors explore the intersecting themes of memory, culture, struggle, and resistance, while giving voice to Central American migrants (primarily from the Northern Triangle&#8212;Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) as essential actors in the history and future of the Americas. Addressing the erasure and assumed silence of central-americanos within both the U.S. nation-state and U.S. Latinidad, this timely and trailblazing anthology challenges scholars and educators to reconsider the attention paid to the experiences and subjectivities of migrantes de Guatemala, Belice, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, y Panama.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since it was published in 2016, <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/professor-emeritus/arlie-r-hochschild">Arlie Russell Hochschild</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvISxWuZcSUFHEjoo8KiRRUAAAFiJIIbTwEAAAFKAWGSb54/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1620973499/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1620973499&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=bTQh8ldyOeEXknEifnTEGA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right</a> (The New Press, 2016) has been many times heralded as necessary reading for our current political moment. For her perceptive and dramatic account of a Berkeley sociologist&#8217;s exploration of Tea Party enthusiasm in coastal Louisiana, Dr. Hochschild received honors and awards from many directions, including a spot as a finalist for the national book award. Now released in paperback in January 2018, Dr. Hochschild&#8217;s book includes a new afterword, and continues to stand as both a moving narrative portrait of a political community and a strong example of scholarly work at the crossroads of academic research and public discourse.<br />
Using environmental policy as her keyhole issue, Dr. Hochschild articulates the logic that structures a &#8220;great paradox&#8221;: states which receive the highest levels of financial support from the federal government are also home to the deepest wells of resentment against government intervention in private life. Dr. Hochschild&#8217;s work discloses an emotional &#8220;deep story&#8221; that shapes the political imagination of her Tea Party interlocutors, the feeling that deserving Americans are pushed to the back of the line for the American Dream.<br />
Tracing the open rhetoric and the social silences that reveal the shape of a community&#8217;s political imagination, Dr. Hochschild&#8217;s research speaks to the roles of race and religion in forming the foundation of American politics. Her interviewees were mostly white, and mostly Christian. In exploring the ways in which the Tea Party deep story manifests a resentment against government work to curb irresponsible private power and provide public support for disadvantaged Americans, Strangers in Their Own Land chronicles Dr. Hochschild&#8217;s attempts to climb the &#8220;empathy walls&#8221; that surround and isolate communities sharply defined by ideological allegiance and disavowed histories of misused power.<br />
Along the way, Strangers in Their Own Land recounts the intellectual, political, and economic history that lies behind the great paradox of our current political crisis, and profiles figures who may offer us a way out of the bind.<br />
For this interview, I asked Dr. Hochschild to speak to the process of writing a book for multiple audiences in a partisan climate. When researching and writing this book in the years leading up to the 2016 election, who did she imagine as her readers and what did she hope they would take away from her project? Our conversation covers the place of this book in the trajectory of her career, the difficulty of turning off the ethical &#8220;alarm system&#8221; while conducting interviews, structuring an academic book to capture the drama of a research question, and the principles that Dr. Hochschild believes activists can use to build momentum in the coming months.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Although largely forgotten today, elocution was a popular form of domestic and professional entertainment from the late nineteenth century until around World War II. Elocution is the dramatic reading of poetry, adapted plays, and other types of monologues by a solo performer. Dr. <a href="https://music.uiowa.edu/people/marian-wilson-kimber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marian Wilson Kimber&#8217;</a>s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjyNUH24unv2pR2VxLrHzXgAAAFiH2HBCQEAAAFKAcxEeMI/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252082222/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0252082222&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=GYLzUUQyzs5.qge0xRt9Zw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elocutionists: Women, Music, and the Spoken Word </a>(University of Illinois Press, 2017) is the first study to examine elocutionists who recited spoken word accompanied by music and proscribed movements that reflected the emotional meaning of the piece. Informed by archival sources gathered all over the country, Wilson Kimber engages with this practice through multiple lenses, including gender, race, and class as she untangles not only how elocution was performed, but also what it meant to its practitioners and audiences. She highlights important figures that some may know from other areas such as Kitty Cheatham, an advocate for and performer of African American spirituals, and the actress Fanny Kemble. However, most of the women she profiles were performers, entrepreneurs, and composers whose work has disappeared from public view as their artform fell out of favor. In addition to reciting in concert halls and for women&#8217;s clubs, professional elocutionists usually taught others and many founded their own schools in towns and cities throughout the United States. Their work helped create opportunities for women to move into professional occupations and contributed to twentieth-century conceptions of middle-class respectability. Dr. Wilson Kimber has videotaped several reconstructions of elocution performances which can be seen on her YouTube channel <a href="http://bit.ly/2GbeRlV">here</a>. They are surprisingly humorous and address topics that people will recognize today including the pressure on women to dress fashionably, the excitement of a summer romance, and the aches and pains of aging.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[True crime is as popular as ever in our present moment. Both television and podcast series have gained critical praise and large audiences by exploring largely unknown individual crimes in depth and using them to consider broader questions surrounding the justice system, guilt and innocence, class and racial inequality, and evidence. Rarely do we get to think historically about these broader topics through the lens of individual, especially unknown, cases in light of the challenges posed by researching historical crimes. <a href="http://www.kalinicolegross.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kali Nicole Gross</a>, Martin Luther King, Jr. Professor of History at Rutgers University New Brunswick, has done incredible research to do just that in her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QgZA8RA-ovC_FEE1RsNPbQ0AAAFiDDil0QEAAAFKAWD0EwA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190241217/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190241217&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ijzfjQGHpoksTAcs45AoqA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannah Mary Tabbs and the Disembodied Torso: A Tale of Race, Sex, and Violence in America </a>(Oxford University Press, Hardcover 2016, Paperback 2018). The book won the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award for Nonfiction.<br />
The book tells the story of the discovery of a torso,  the investigation of the murder, and the life of the accused&#8212;Hannah Mary Tabbs. The body was discovered in 1887 and drew an unusual amount of attention in the segregated areas in and around Philadelphia, especially given the victim and accused were black. In this episode of the podcast, Gross discusses why the case caught the eye of the public and investigators at the time. She also explains some of the broader context and insights of the case. Finally, she talks about her research process. We don&#8217;t give away the resolution of the case in our conversation, but will introduce you to Hannah Mary Tabbs and the world of post-Reconstruction Philadelphia in which she lived.<br />

Elihu Root, a major architect of U.S. international power, and a vision of liberal global governance were the initial drivers for pan-Americanism. Carrying the vision were civic leaders, philanthropists, artists, writers and publishers acting as cultural ambassadors with different political, cultural, and personal agendas often at odds with official policy. In fostering a utopian vision of hemispheric solidarity, both U.S. and Latin American cultural leaders were faced with overcoming preconceived ideas and misconceptions of the other, but World War II and the Cold War increasingly turned a project of mutual cultural exchange into an accelerated U.S. propaganda campaign that resulted in political intervention in Latin America. U.S. domestic policies came under scrutiny as well. Smith has given us a thorough study of the complexities of cultural exchange in a time of developing U.S. power and the unforeseen consequences of pan-Americanism.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Medicaid provides health care for around 1 in 5 Americans. Despite the large number served, the programs administration by state and local governments means very different things in different places. The geography of federalism matters a lot for Medicaid. But unlike some other large social welfare programs, Medicaid seems to reduce rather than increase political participation, resulting in a population of people stigmatized by the program itself and afforded less political representation.<br />
Such is a snippet of the argument made by <a href="http://government.cornell.edu/jamila-michener" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamila Michener</a> in her fascinating new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QtEYTjbVbdZq_TQWQaL6IKoAAAFhr96QCAEAAAFKAdKfu90/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1316510190/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1316510190&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=MZDjcTT3ZEkTc2S1I1U7Lw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragmented Democracy: Medicaid, Federalism, and Unequal Politics </a>(Cambridge University Press, 2018). Michener is assistant professor of political science at Cornell University.<br />
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative research, Michener spotlights the people of Medicaid, their awareness of the inequalities that exist across states and localities, and how some are mobilizing to better represent the Medicaid community. What she finds is that where you reside determines a lot about your relationship to the Medicaid program, from state to state and even from neighborhood to neighborhood in a given city.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

From its prehistoric origins to its use in ancient and medieval beermaking, the hop was already an important crop in human agriculture when it first appeared on Colonial American shores, but when it made its way to Oregon&#8217;s lush Willamette Valley in the mid-19th century, it changed itself, the region, and the world forever. Savvy farmers, brewers and marketers soon turned the Willamette Valley into the &#8220;Hops Capital of the World,&#8221; and began to bend the entire world&#8217;s beer industry to their will. The hop somehow managed to survive and even flourish during Prohibition of the 1920s and 1930s, then almost fell victim to a disease that nearly destroyed the fields of aromatic plenty, but laboratory science and big business spelled a resurrection for the hardy hop. This book is a highly readable and interesting new look at the history of beer and the origins of the Pacific Northwest&#8217;s famed craft brewing culture.<br />
Peter A. Kopp is Associate Professor and Director of Public History at New Mexico State University in las Cruces, New Mexico. In addition to researching hops and beer, Dr. Kopp also works on the history of tourism and various aspects of environmental history in the U.S. Southwest. His book Hoptopia won the American Historical Association&#8217;s Pacific Coast Branch Book Award last year, 2017.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When folklorist <a href="https://www.jeanfreedman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean Freedman</a> first met Peggy Seeger in 1979, Freedman was an undergraduate on her junior year abroad in London, while her American compatriot had been living in the UK for two decades. Their encounter took place in the Singers&#8217; Club, a folk music venue that Seeger and her husband Ewan MacColl founded in the early 1960s and to which Freedman returned many times during her London sojourn. After Freedman returned to the States, the pair kept in touch for a while but their contact became increasingly sporadic. However, it began again in earnest when the folklorist emailed Seeger to check some facts for a writing assignment. During their subsequent exchange, Seeger asked if Freedman might know of anyone who would be interested in writing her biography. Immediately, Freedman volunteered herself. Eight years, many interviews, and much text-based research later, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuvO9JCTvCto35F3C3Si9osAAAFiAO3-EQEAAAFKAdf7DwY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252040759/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0252040759&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=KahSoDYJ80Fl6ddZQwDEVQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peggy Seeger: A Life of Music, Love, and Politics</a> (University of Illinois Press, 2017) is the result.<br />
As the book&#8217;s subtitle suggests, Freedman covers multiple aspects of her subject&#8217;s rich story, including Seeger&#8217;s upbringing within a privileged musical family; her relationship with the aforementioned leftwing folksinger and songwriter, actor and playwright Ewan MacColl; her involvement in the production of the groundbreaking BBC Radio Ballads; her musical endeavors, many of which were collaborative; her involvement in the establishment of various initiatives such as the Critics Group, a key aim of which was to help young singers perform folk material in an appropriate manner; and her political activism. Freedman also writes about Seeger&#8217;s return to America in the early 1990s following MacColl&#8217;s death, then her subsequent relocation to Britain in 2010 where she continues to live and be astonishingly active. Seeger&#8217;s most recent album, Everything Changes, was released in 2014, and when this New Books in Folklore interview with Freedman was recorded in March 2018, she already had another one in the works.<br />
Freedman&#8217;s Peggy Seeger: A Life of Music, Love, and Politics is the first full length study of an important cultural figure and has been very well received since its publication last year. A recent review in the Journal of Folklore Research described the book as offering a comprehensive overview of Peggy Seeger&#8217;s life along with an absorbing history of the folk music revival. It also praises Freedman&#8217;s prose for being as approachable and entertaining as Seeger&#8217;s lyrics and informal, intimate performance style.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[My students don&#8217;t remember Vietnam.<br />
That&#8217;s hard to believe, for someone born in 1968. But it&#8217;s true, nonetheless. High school history courses rarely make it past World War Two. The Cold War and the Berlin Wall are mysteries. And Vietnam, unless someone in their family fought there, is just a country.<br />
But most, if not all, of my students have heard of the Vietnam Memorial. They may not know what or who it commemorates. But they&#8217;ve seen it on class trips, or in textbooks. And they universally praise its power and simplicity. So, unless you&#8217;re my age, it&#8217;s hard to imagine the bitterness and divisions which greeted Maya Lin&#8217;s memorial.<br />
In his new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qv-_OcdtNxBAqGM3KTpJsn8AAAFh_b6b4AEAAAFKAfPJyM8/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1628728566/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1628728566&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=q3EhBXlED-ztkss3wpT1Sw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Rift in the Earth: Art, Memory and the Fight for a Vietnam War Memorial</a> (Arcade Publishing, 2017), <a href="http://www.restonbooks.com/">James Reston, Jr.</a> retells this story in a way that brings it alive again. Reston brings a journalist&#8217;s eye for character and narrative to the book. Several authors have told this tale, but Reston is by far the best at bringing the story to life. Less interested in putting this memorial into the broader context of memorialization in the 1970s, he instead concentrates on retelling the story and on explaining to a modern audience why it matters. And, when you&#8217;ve finished the narrative heart of the book, you suddenly learn why the story seems so personal and important to Reston.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://newcomb.tulane.edu/content/aidan-smith-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aidan Smith</a> has written a timely and important analysis of the way that we understand images, masculinity, and femininity, especially through the lens of presidential campaigns and political advertising. Smith&#8217;s book, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Gender-Heteronormativity-and-the-American-Presidency/Smith/p/book/9781138633544">Gender, Heteronormativity, and the American Presidency</a> (Routledge, 2017) explores the idea of heteronormativity within our implicit and explicit conceptions of the American presidency&#8212;thus focusing not only on how masculinity is deployed to create particular images of candidates running for office, but also how femininity is used for both first ladies, and for female candidates for the White House who must negotiate an even more complicated set of expectations given our two hundred year history with the occupants of the Oval Office. Smith delves into the complexity of gender performance in presidential politics, and how embedded expectations of patriarchy, fatherhood, manly success, and particular experiences (wartime, boardroom, etc.) all contribute to expectations that are applied to those running for office, especially executive office. This book weaves together analyses and perspectives from a number of fields and disciplines, and thus will be of interest to political scientists who study the presidency and campaigns, as well as political theorists who explore questions of gender performance and sexuality, along with historians and communication experts exploring the integration of televisual images within the American household and the impact of this technological shift. This is a broad study that braids together gender performance expectations, heteronormativity, a nuanced understanding of the presidency, and an analysis of what that position and office often mean to the citizenry.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When first enacted at the start of the twentieth century, primaries were to decrease the power of party bosses to dominate the choice of who ran for office. Primaries were a feature of the progressive agenda to limit political corruption and democratize party politics. One hundred years later, party organizations remain powerful arbiters of candidate selection. Candidates who aren&#8217;t backed by the party rarely fare well.<br />
In his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnsMFCm1TfwoG0YahlfxNHUAAAFhruJyEAEAAAFKAc5_fLw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1108413102/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1108413102&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=WGKVIo4SpAyr8VQBvtpDBA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Party&#8217;s Primary: Control of Congressional Nominations</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2018), <a href="https://www.cornellcollege.edu/academics/our-faculty/faculty-profile/index.php/show/hhassell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hans Hassell</a> shows the way that parties use their resources to influence primary elections.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Land is central in the construction of identity for many communities. For Ute Native Americans the meaning of a twelve million acre homeland in western Colorado is intricately linked to the various ways they understand their heritage and future. <a href="http://www.drbrandidenison.com/about.html">Brandi Denison</a>, Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies at University of North Florida, narrates the history of this community&#8217;s removal, remembrance, and return to this land in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qkrja_didf21-2ijriH-85AAAAFh5sJUWQEAAAFKAQEeV4o/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0803276745/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0803276745&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wsx6eEzzETRb7PemPkfSOw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ute Land Religion in the American West, 1879-2009</a> (University of Nebraska Press, 2017). She argues that discourses about religion were essential to settler colonialism in the American West. These took shape through justifications for the displacement of Utes, in civilizing missionary projects, imagined nostalgia about pre-contact Colorado, and as a means for Ute to warrant inclusion and return. The category of religion was deployed in a variety of ways by natives and white settlers in order to establish, deny, exclude, and restore communities within the region. In our conversation we discuss the shift from notions of dirt to land, Ute engagement with the term religion, land and religious identity, Nathan Meeker and the 1879 conflict in the White River valley, Ute removal, sexual purity, morality and rape, Ute Land Religion in fiction and anthropology, the Meeker Massacre Pageant, the Smoking River Powwow, and attempts at reconciliation.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Eddie Cantor was once among the most popular performers in the United States. He was influential and innovative on stage, radio, and film from the early twentieth century though the early 1960s. He is not widely known today, however, despite his importance in his time. In a new biography, <a href="https://www.davidmweinstein.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Weinstein</a> discusses Cantor, his work, his times, and his politics. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvvWx3rToxHNJMJjoVT7EboAAAFh7ECzMgEAAAFKASIq-60/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1512600482/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1512600482&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ebsNQhZPU079CpGA.1y93A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Eddie Cantor Story: A Jewish Life in Performance and Politics </a>(Brandeis University Press, 2017) explains the many ways Cantor&#8217;s work was representative of the period, but also the ways he pushed the boundaries of entertainment during his career. Cantor was Jewish and unlike many of his Jewish contemporaries in the business, he did not hide or shy away from his background either in performance or in politics.<br />
In this episode of New Books in History, Weinstein discusses his biography of Cantor. He talks about Cantor&#8217;s career and his anti-Nazi activism and the importance of his Jewish heritage is shaping his career and political activism. Weinstein also discusses some of the more contradictory aspects of Cantor&#8217;s career, particularly his use of blackface.<br />

Starting with show such as Candid Camera and An American Family, Kraszewski positions reality television in cities where individuals were able to thrive regardless of social class. In this space, early reality television created a laboratory for individuals. Moving to the early 1990s and beyond, Kraszewski challenges the ways in which reality television persisted in this relationship with the city although most viewers do not have the means to live in cities. Using case studies of how the Bravo network exploits the urban servant, the examination of &#8220;Boston&#8221; Rob Marino and Tiffany &#8220;New York&#8221; Pollard as reality show representative of major global American cities, and how shows such as Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Alaska: The Last Frontier, and Swamp People, Krasweski present the complex and often problematic relationships between American urban space and the way in which reality television uses and exploits that space in relation to their characters.<br />

The book uses the literary device of &#8220;Elizabeth Ranke,&#8221; an ideal type of the modern academic historian, to show how academic disciplines, the structure of college and careers, the tensions between popular and academic publishing, and the morality and ethics of history, shape the &#8220;history book.&#8221; Whilst each chapter critically relates a stage in Elizabeth&#8217;s life and career to the form &#8220;history books&#8221; take, the overall message of the book is a positive defense of history in the current social and political juncture. A short and accessible text, the book will be essential reading for anyone interested in the artifact called &#8220;a history book.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

While <a href="http://polisci.rutgers.edu/cb-profile/saladina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saladin Ambar</a>&#8216;s book focuses specifically on Cuomo&#8217;s life, his engagement with Democratic politics, his speeches, it is much broader in scope and in importance as an analysis of the changing dynamics in American politics as the sun set on the New Deal and, in its place, we observed the rise of the Reagan Revolution and the Conservative movement. Ambar examines Cuomo not just as a politician and elected official, but also as theorist about the role of government in the lives of modern Americans. This is why he is dubbed the American version of the Cicero.<br />
Ambar&#8217;s book would be of interest to those who study American political development and American history, American Political Thought, and, in particular, the connection between political parties, electoral politics, governors.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the last few weeks, minimum wage workers in 18 states saw their wages go up; in Maine a full dollar increase. Why states have taken the lead on raising the minimum wage is the topic of the new book from <a href="https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/our-people/faculty-staff/witko_christopher.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Witko</a> and <a href="http://community.wvu.edu/~wwf0002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Franko</a>, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjitLBN4ymypbbnrQCHs_rIAAAFhrmlOuAEAAAFKARi14oY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190671017/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190671017&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=gjPdmbvH-unQDmVZm3uDcw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Economic Populism: How States Respond to Economic Inequality</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017). Witko is associate professor of political science at the University of South Carolina; Franko is assistant professor of political science at West Virginia University.<br />
In the book, they argue, despite rising inequality, the federal government has been unable to muster the will to address the problem. Instead, we are seeing many states actively addressing economic inequality, often through direct democracy. Franko and Witko show that the states that address inequality are not necessarily those with the greatest levels of inequality, but instead are those states where citizens are aware and concerned with growing inequality. They examine how various factors have shaped state policies that boost incomes at the bottom (the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit) and reduce incomes at the top (with top marginal tax rates) between 1987 and 2010.<br />

In the media and popular imagination, the wealthy are often presented as self-serving people who single-mindedly accrue and display social advantages for themselves and their children. Sherman&#8217;s findings destroy this stereotype. Instead, she found that the wealthy believed in diversity and meritocracy. They were often reluctant to talk about their wealth and were conflicted about their position in a class-based society. The rich wanted to see themselves as hard working people who give back and raise children with good values. They longed to be considered morally worthy and generally depicted themselves as productive and prudent.<br />

Born into a middle-class family in Pennsylvania, his mother worked to ensure that Locke had the best education possible. After graduating from Harvard and spending three years in Europe as the first African American Rhodes Scholar, Locke returned to the United States and took a position at Howard University. In the 1920s he encouraged African Americans to embrace their own cultural past, becoming one of the leading promoters of the Harlem Renaissance then emerging in the country. Though his relationship with its leading figures was often fraught with tension, Locke never gave up his advocacy of Afro-American cultural identity, which he continued for the rest of his life through his writings, his lectures, and his sponsorship of African American artists.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

His book begins with the conclusion of the French and Indian War and follows the story until the Louisiana Purchase secured the area for the United States. It superbly illustrates the weak control exerted by Britain, France, and Spain over the Louisiana-Florida borderlands during the last half of the eighteenth century. It also highlights the fragile ties between Anglo-Americans in the region and the newly independent United States. In doing so, Narrett introduces a rogues&#8217; gallery of schemers and adventurers who operated below the radar, ready to do whatever it took to further their private ends. He also ably covers the diplomatic machinations of imperial and American officials as they tried to make good their claims to lands between the southern Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River.<br />

Reflecting the way this book examines both of these branches of government and the exercise of their respective powers, Investigating the President garnered two impressive book awards, from the Presidents and Executive Politics Section (Richard E. Neustadt Book Award) and from the Legislative Studies Section (Richard F. Fenno Book Award) of the American Political Science Association. <a href="http://polisci.la.psu.edu/people/dlk96" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Douglas Kriner</a> and <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu/people/person/eric-schickler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Schickler</a> explore the precedent for congressional investigations into the conduct of and within the Executive branch, while they also amassed over 100 years of data surrounding congressional investigations to discern the impact of these kinds of investigations, even when they do not result, necessarily, in articles of impeachment or indictments of presidential appointees. Investigating the President notes the patterns of impact, from curbing presidential military engagement abroad to shifting the media focus and grabbing the narrative away from the president. The fascinating conclusion points to this under-researched area of congressional power and oversight that may have a more significant impact on presidential conduct and power than has generally been anticipated.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Beginning with the controversies over birth control in the 1920s, she takes us through the twentieth century to the most recent battles over same-sex marriage dividing American Christians both politically and religiously. Moral Combat features pivotal figures including, birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, the fundamentalist radio preacher Billy James Hargis and the first gay Episcopal Bishop Gene Robinson. She demonstrates how pro and con positions were not always clearly defined and adherents could change sides in a matter of a decade, finding surprising allies. In the new millennium two distinct religious visions for society and human sexuality had taken root unraveling any hope of consensus.<br />

By analyzing archival documents along with periodicals, internet sources, and a wealth of self-conducted interviews, Hirschhorn concludes that many American-Israeli settlers are not the messianic, ultra-right-wing fanatics that stereotypes suggest. Instead, the majority come from liberal American backgrounds, are highly-educated, and have conservative&#8212;but rarely Orthodox&#8212;Jewish backgrounds. What is more, she argues, their actions, motives, and self-conceptualizations are reflective of the evolution of American and Israeli Jewish identities over time.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1758, Peter Williamson appeared on the streets of Aberdeen, Scotland, dressed as a Native American and telling a remarkable tale. He claimed that as a young boy he had been kidnapped from the city and sold into slavery in America. In performances and in a printed narrative he peddled to his audiences, Williamson described his tribulations as an indentured servant, Indian captive, soldier, and prisoner of war. Aberdeen&#8217;s magistrates called him a liar and banished him from the city, but Williamson defended his story.<br />
In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qgp9Li7sQ54e7nHBqzkmRAIAAAFho6gd6wEAAAFKAdSl6wM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674976320/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0674976320&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=b8rrmkkMYkvc7AL6iukX3Q&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Captive, Indian King: Peter Williamson in America and Britain</a> (Harvard University Press, 2018), Gettysburg College History Department Chair and Professor <a href="https://www.gettysburg.edu/academics/history/faculty/employee_detail.dot?empId=02000281720013342&amp;pageTitle=Timothy+J.+Shannon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Timothy J. Shannon</a> explains what Williamson&#8217;s tale says about how working people of eighteenth-century Britain, so often depicted as victims of empire, found ways to create lives and exploit opportunities within it. Exiled from Aberdeen, Williamson settled in Edinburgh, where he cultivated enduring celebrity as the self-proclaimed king of the Indians. His performances and publications capitalized on the curiosity the Seven Years&#8217; War had ignited among the public for news and information about America and its native inhabitants. As a coffeehouse proprietor and printer, he gave audiences a plebeian perspective on Britain&#8217;s rise to imperial power in North America.<br />
Indian Captive, Indian King is a history of empire from the bottom up, showing how Williamson&#8217;s American odyssey illuminates the real-life experiences of everyday people on the margins of the British Empire and how those experiences, when repackaged in travel narratives and captivity tales, shaped popular perceptions about the empires racial and cultural geography.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://history.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/hanna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark G. Hanna</a> offers a unique perspective on the roles played by piracy in the formation of the British colonial project. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuzKP4RB7cbPx5e_wQ0lo2kAAAFhmXTfGQEAAAFKAVfkCH0/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469617943/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469617943&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=6XfwWVBpiH8mHZWPrw6MRQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pirate Nests and the Rise of the British Empire, 1570 to 1740</a> (University of North Carolina Press for the Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture, 2015), Hanna weaves a fascinating tale from legal and commercial sources to illustrate ways that the English government often tolerated, and at times encouraged predation on the high seas. The goods obtained in these thinly disguised robberies not only helped prime the economic pump of the England&#8217;s North American and Caribbean colonies, they were often vital for their survival during their early years. The tide turned against unregulated privateering and outright piracy after London reformed key aspects of overseas trade. As a result, formerly scarce commodities became widely available in the New World, diminishing the demand for stolen property. Simultaneously, the royal government also sought to rationalize its legal system, making it easier for Admiralty courts to prosecute pirates while also simplifying process of selling off goods seized by legitimate privateers who operated with the king&#8217;s permission.<br />

Grobe explores how confession&#8212;from the confessional poets of the 1960s to contemporary reality TV&#8212;is both constructed and authentic, artful even in its ostensible artlessness, and always on the move between and across media. The work&#8217;s archive is expansive, placing in conversation poetry, performance art, comedy, legal confession, film, and reality TV, genres whose conventions transform and whose boundaries blur when confronted with artists impulses to confess, to stage what Grobe calls &#8220;breakthroughs&#8221; out of both generic and sociocultural containment. Laying bare the ways confessional performances are stylized and mediated to elicit &#8220;a satiety of experience which can be taken as reality&#8221; while taking seriously artists&#8217; attempts to reveal and perform an authentic self, Grobe demonstrates how confession energizes new ways of being, forms of collectivity, and political mobilization.<br />

Fridman begins his investigation by looking into a best-selling book in what he calls financial self-help, an ascendant genre of self-help that tries to teach its readers how they should think about the economy today and what their goals and ethics ought to be as actors in that new economy. Using ethnographic and interview methods, Fridman gets to know the people who practice the advice of these books, participating in their various seminars and fascinating financially-focused board-game meet-ups. Fridman unpacks the core ideas that animate this world and shows that, far from being an isolated ideology, the worldview posited by financial self-help can teach us a lot about how people are remaking themselves as economic actors in the world today. Adding another level of analysis, the book also has a comparative component as Fridman tracks these groups and ideas as they play out across different cultures in the United States and in Argentina. This book will excite anyone interesting in making sense of the profound human changes that come attendant with our rapidly changing economy.<br />

Flavors of Empire explores how Thai food became hyper-visible in the United States, and yet Thai people have remained relatively invisible in American life. The story of Thai food in America begins with U.S. informal empire and culinary tourism in Thailand in the 1950s. Subsequent migration and settlement in LA spurred a Thai restaurant boom in the 1970s and 1980s. Padoongpatt investigates how these culinary contact zones helped shape Thai identity while remaining attentive to tensions over ethnicity, class, and gender in these spaces. The commercially driven, multicultural sensibility that made Thai cuisine popular among Angelenos had its limits, however, and Padoongpatt uses the clash over a weekend food festival at a Thai Buddhist temple to highlight conflicting modes of suburbanization. By the 1990s, the Thai community could organize politically, and used local culinary tourism to stimulate equitable economic development in the newly designated Thai Town neighborhood of LA. As the story of Thai cuisine in the U.S. continues to unfold, Flavors of Empire urges readers to think critically about the long journeys&#8212;both geographic and historical&#8212;that our food has taken to get to our plates.<br />

From the beginning the nation struggled with the ideal and the reality of social inequality based on religion, nationality, ethnicity, race, gender, age and social class. Americans debated the vision of equality as reserved before God alone, equality before the law and equality of opportunity. Brown demonstrates how these debates played out in criminal trials and punishment, divorce cases, and among immigrants and African Americans. Seeking to distinguish themselves from the inherited class structure of England, Americans retained a feature that would make equality difficult to realize, namely inherited private property and patriarchal coverture. Brown gives us a thorough understanding of the myth of a classless society that has held sway since the founding of the nation.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the most neglected areas of musicological research is art music written by nineteenth-century American composers, thus <a href="https://blair.vanderbilt.edu/bio/douglas-shadle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Douglas Shadle</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrdwP-aqd_THT4uscFAXk6wAAAFhhgU6VAEAAAFKATf4ZWw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199358648/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0199358648&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=mQDwwH1IxOj-fjYL36zxrA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orchestrating the Nation: The Nineteenth-Century American Symphonic Enterprise </a>(Oxford University Press, 2015) is a welcome, and much needed, addition to the field. It is the first comprehensive survey of American nineteenth-century orchestral music. Organized chronologically, each chapter also features a detailed critical analysis of a major work. Shadle unearths, analyzes, and advocates for a repertoire that has been erased almost completely from the historical and performance record. Along the way, Shadle debunks or nuances some of the most common narratives in musicological historiography on American music. Written in a lively, approachable style, he provides contemporary assessments of the music, while also contextualizing American symphonic works within the musical, cultural, and political history of the United States. Despite focusing on nineteenth-century music and composers, Shadle&#8217;s work resonates with and informs some of the controversies that dog classical music today, including the continued dominance of pieces by white male composers in the repertoire of the nations leading orchestras. He challenges the arguments that critics made then, and some continue to make today, that uphold the systemic exclusion of non-canonical music and works by composers from marginalized groups.

<a href="https://blair.vanderbilt.edu/bio/douglas-shadle">Douglas W. Shadle</a> is an assistant professor of musicology at Vanderbilt University whose research centers primarily on American orchestral music and American musical culture in the nineteenth century. His work has appeared in many journals and collected editions including American Music, the Journal of the Society for American Music, and MLA Notes. His article How Santa Clause Became a Slave Driver: The Work of Print Culture in a Nineteenth-Century Controversy won the 2016 Society for American Music Irving Lowen&#8217;s Article Award and a 2015 ASCAP Deems Taylor/Virgil Thomson Award. Orchestrating the Nation: The Nineteenth-Century American Symphonic Enterprise has been well-reviewed not only by musicologists, but also in the popular press in venues such as The New York Times, The New Yorker, and the Washington Post. It was also honored with an ASCAP Foundation Deems Taylor/Virgil Thomson Award in 2017. Currently, Shadle is working on a short monograph for the Oxford Keynote Series on Antonin Dvo&#345;ak&#8217;s New World Symphony.<br />

These people were largely illiterate. They had to learn how to spell as they were trying to compose their thoughts on paper. Yet Hager leaves their letters &#8216;uncorrected.&#8217; In their struggle to put their feelings and thoughts into words&#8212;a struggle we also feel in reading those words&#8212;the words themselves gain an immediacy and directness. They grow in importance for being chosen. The repetition of phrases throbs with feeling. The emotional dynamics of union and disunion&#8212;the fear of being forgotten, the assurance of love, no matter the soldier&#8217;s side in the war&#8212;congeal around individual words, phrases, even marks on the page. As they write, both soldiers and their family members realize that they&#8217;re at war together, tending to the relationships that comprise their everyday lives, and warding off the threats to them.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The concept of late-night basketball gained prominence in the late 1980s when G. Van Standifer founded Midnight Basketball League as a vehicle upon which citizens, businesses, and institutions can stand together to prevent crime, violence, and drug abuse. The concept ignited and late-night basketball leagues were developed in dozens of cities across America. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlA202tGQjDGSPO7BKas51sAAAFhgdUGGgEAAAFKAc8AT48/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022637498X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022637498X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=vEZO1N6xfF0iJKjqCzHM8Q&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight Basketball: Race, Sports, and Neoliberal Social Policy</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016), <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/hartm021">Douglas Hartmann</a> traces the history of late-night basketball with particular emphasis on the racial ideologies, cultural tensions, and institutional realities that continue to shape sports-based social policy. Hartmann brings to life the experience he had as a researcher in the field working with late-night basketball programs and the young men they were intended to serve. This experience provided him with a more grounded and nuanced understanding of the intricate ways sports, race, and risk intersect and interact in urban America.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Do we live in a country of red and blue states or something more purple-ish? The red state/blue state meme of 2000 has really never gone away, and scholarly debate, as well as frequent media attention, has argued for its merits and demerits. Are we a sharply divided and polarized nation or simply one divided by electoral rules that exacerbate relatively small partisan differences?<br />
In <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/david--hopkins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David A. Hopkins</a>&#8216; <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QncnyHRGYp3vhI86SHZbdo0AAAFg2-9ATgEAAAFKARux3lY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1316642143/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1316642143&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=.D3j86myZ57o6dxbdIqlQQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Fighting Blue: How Geography and Electoral Rules Polarize American Politics</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2017), he sets out to reconcile many aspects of this debate. He argues for the importance of geography in the context of constitutionally-established electoral procedures, especially the Electoral College. He shows the ways that changes in party coalitions and the rising importance of ideology and issues for the two parties, relate to the electoral map.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the wake of Ken Burns&#8217; most recent series, The Vietnam War, America&#8217;s fascination with the conflict shows no sign of abating. Fortunately the flood of popular retellings of old narratives is supplemented by a number of well-researched and reasoned efforts aimed at garnering a better sense of how our presumptions about the Vietnam War are in need of reinterpretation and revision. Returning to New Books in Military History is historian <a href="https://www.chapman.edu/our-faculty/gregory-daddis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gregory A. Daddis</a>, author of two recent accounts of the war that together offer a sharp reassessment of the American effort. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrhyQZNRPmycUQJ_kM8YlsEAAAFhdbCceQEAAAFKAU9yBFo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190231467/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190231467&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=tKZ0SOsUxSyDLnAFtrm4Wg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Westmoreland&#8217;s War: Reassessing America&#8217;s Strategy in Vietnam</a> (Oxford University Press, 2014) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Withdrawal-Reassessing-Americas-Final-Vietnam/dp/0190691085/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518185921&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Withdrawal+daddis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Withdrawal: Reassessing America&#8217;s Final Years in Vietnam </a>(Oxford University Press, 2017) Daddis challenges many existing perceptions of the readiness and roles of MACV&#8217;s two most prominent commanders, Generals William Westmoreland and Creighton Abrams, as well as their struggles with the Washington defense establishment during the war. By centering his study on the strategic planning and its execution, Daddis not only acknowledges the centrality of Vietnamese agency in the outcome of the war, he also reveals how some historians have misjudged the war&#8217;s outcome to present flawed visions of possible victory.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On a cold, rainy dawn in late November 1872, Lieutenant Frazier Boutelle and a Modoc Indian nicknamed Scarface Charley leveled firearms at each other. Their duel triggered a war that capped a decades-long genocidal attack that was emblematic of the United States&#8217; conquest of Native Americas peoples and lands. California author and editor <a href="http://www.ramcnally.com/bio.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robert Aquinas McNally</a> tells the wrenching story of this conflict in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Ql7KPRx1qPbHKcRKCpun37IAAAFhdWYe9AEAAAFKAZUaZ6w/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1496201795/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1496201795&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=SgQrqsTu9QzFaPdu4XDyvA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Modoc War: A Story of Genocide at the Dawn of America&#8217;s Gilded Age </a> (Bison Books, 2017). The 1872-73 Modoc War was one of the nation&#8217;s costliest campaigns against North American Indigenous peoples, in which the army placed nearly one thousand soldiers in the field against some fifty-five Modoc fighters.<br />
Although little known today, the Modoc War dominated national headlines for an entire year. Fought in south-central Oregon and northeastern California, the war settled into a siege in the desolate Lava Beds and climaxed the decades-long effort to dispossess and destroy the Modocs. The war did not end with the last shot fired, however. For the first and only time in U.S. history, Native fighters were tried and hanged for war crimes. The surviving Modocs were packed into cattle cars and shipped from Fort Klamath to the corrupt, disease-ridden Quapaw reservation in Oklahoma, where they found peace even more lethal than war.<br />
The Modoc War tells the forgotten story of a violent and bloody Gilded Age campaign at a time when the federal government boasted officially of a &#8220;peace policy&#8221; toward Indigenous nations. This compelling history illuminates a dark corner in our country&#8217;s past.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.moval.edu/Faculty/schmidtc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire Schmidt</a> is not a prison worker, rather she is a folklorist and an Assistant Professor at Missouri Valley College. However, many members of her extended family in her home state of Wisconsin either were or are prison workers and it is their work-related humor that inspired this book.<br />
<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qs9b1EToIPET4wukdTHV92QAAAFhcYiMyAEAAAFKATTtBSY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0299313506/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0299313506&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=RH5vvhE2vgxFo3lnsa3HmA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">If You Don&#8217;t Laugh, You&#8217;ll Cry: The Occupational Humor of White Wisconsin Prison Workers </a>(University of Wisconsin Press, 2017) is based on multiple interviews which Schmidt conducted during a decade or more, and also on her memories of hearing relatives talk about their working lives to great comedic effect at family gatherings over the years. Schmidt&#8217;s analysis provides many different examples of the ways in which humor can be deployed by prison workers. For example, it can be a means of acclimatizing recent recruits to their new roles as prison officers; it can alleviate the long stretches of tedium that characterize prison work, as well as offer a way to cope with the periods of extremely high stress which punctuate that tedium; it can help officers negotiate the boundaries between their working and their non-working lives; and it can help them to maintain manageable relationships with&#8212;and exercise control over&#8212;the inmates under their watch.<br />
In presenting her research, Schmidt engages with a range of previous folkloristic studies of work-placed culture. She also situates her subject within a problematic institutional landscape. She highlights the fact that the Wisconsin prison system has the highest incarceration rate of black men in the United States, describing it as a clear example of ongoing and systematic social injustice at the state level (5) and an oppressive structure of institutionalized racism and class warfare that affects both inmates and prison workers (11). She also attends to popular preconceptions about correctional officers which often depicts them as sadistic bullies. Whilst some could be described as such, Schmidt ultimately argues that casting prison workers in the public role of the bad guys keeps the hostile public focus on the relatively powerless individual prison worker as the source of oppression and racism, which deflects the focus of public critique and outrage from the larger social and political institutions that maintain oppression and racism (13).<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1898, the United States took control of the Philippines from the Spanish. The U.S. then entered into a brutal war to make the Filipinos submit to the new colonial power. The war and subsequent decades of U.S. rule meant a small, but continuous presence of American soldiers on the islands, which, unsurprisingly, produced a notable population of children born to Filipino mothers and American fathers. Nicholas Trajano Molnar&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlZzlZC2pOi1qFku6Z5O9bMAAAFhZqZ7cAEAAAFKAZxEW2I/http://www.amazon.com/dp/082622122X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=082622122X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=qi7MyXHSgfy.sqqIzs66-w&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Mestizos, the Philippines, and the Malleability of Race, 1898-1961 </a> (University of Missouri Press, 2017), examines the contested racial identities of these children. The United States brought a strong and binary sense of racial hierarchy to the discussion. Yet, as Molnar shows, Filipino understandings of race prevented a simple application of American ideas. The children were defined as American Mestizos locally, but many simply lived as Filipinos. Molnar&#8217;s book examines the ongoing contest over this mixed nationality and mixed race populations identity. By examining the process of racial formation of a group that never cohered as a separate identity group, American Mestizos provides uncommon insight into, as the title suggests, the malleability of race, and does so in a very readable narrative.<br />
In this episode, Molnar discusses the insights of American Mestizos about this history of racial identity in the Philippines and in the U.S. He explains some of the efforts within the Philippines and by U.S. policymakers to shape the racial identity of the Mestizos and the stakes of this debate for various segments of the U.S. military. Finally, he also discusses the research involved in the project.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The story of the American West as it is often told typically involves Spanish, British, and American Empires struggling with Indigenous people for control of the vast territory lands and riches from the Mississippi to the Pacific. After the seventeenth century, French colonists and French-speaking Metis are often relegated to the role of bit players in this tale. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qi6dtDHnUjigV4BfPI1NjFQAAAFhavpBwwEAAAFKAeaOoy4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1771860812/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1771860812&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=cGXFcK65PoTse6QZd1SoMg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs Upon the Rivers: The Buried History of the French-Speaking Canadiens and Metis From the Great Lakes and the Mississippi Across to the Pacific </a>(Baraka Books, 2016) reemphasizes the importance of the French imperial legacy and Metis influence in the Great Lakes region, on the northern plains, and in the far Pacific West. In doing so, this book challenges American and Canadian narratives about the west which too often tend toward racial and national binaries. By telling the stories of people who lived across ethnic and national boundaries, Robert Foxcurran, Michel Bouchard, and Sebastien Mallett show how historians can use the complications of the past to explode notions of perceived difference in the present day, and in doing so reveal important stories about the Trans-Mississippi West which have been buried for far too long.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Throughout many American classrooms, students learn how the United States was formed, and most importantly, the historical figures who helped produce the contemporary nation we occupy. All too often, however, African American, Latinx, and Native Americans are not given similar attention. Rather, they are depicted as passive receivers of what those of European-descent pushed upon them.<br />
In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvrW89RxJFXsS5lWCbFwuksAAAFhYUc_4QEAAAFKAbWNlKA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807013102/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0807013102&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=H0CCwgrMgcDrQJI..elIQg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An African American and Latinx History of the United States</a> (Beacon Press, 2017), <a href="https://history.ufl.edu/directory/current-faculty/paul-ortiz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Ortiz</a> attempts to bring more balance to this picture. By employing a bottom-up approach, Ortiz shows how central black and brown solidarities were to the political history of the United States. Ortiz&#8217;s is a narrative history spanning two hundred-plus years of African Americans, Latinx, and Native Americans expanding what freedom and justice in the United States meant by challenging American exceptionalism, imperialism, and colonialism as much as possible.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s a sad story known well. In dead of winter at Wounded Knee Creek in 1890, U.S. soldiers with the Seventh Cavalry Regiment gunned down over two hundred Lakota men, women, and children. Their crime? Taking part in the Ghost Dance ritual. What happened afterwards is a story told less often. <a href="https://tcu.academia.edu/DavidGrua" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David W. Grua</a>, historian and editor with the Joseph Smith Papers project, tells about the competing memory and counter-memory of Wounded Knee as the U.S. Army first shaped the narrative, and later, Lakotas attempted to have their side of the story heard. In his Robert M. Utley Prize winning book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqjuVr49XHUDzdIRpHjmKYsAAAFhVwqFQgEAAAFKAUWmKok/http://www.amazon.com/dp/019024903X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=019024903X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=tjfd-jVSo2nsLD29bXk0Tg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surviving Wounded Knee: The Lakotas and the Politics of Memory</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), Grua argues that race, official memory, and public memorialization served the purposes of white supremacy on the northern Great Plains throughout much of the early twentieth century. Official army reports as well as physical memorialization at the massacre site spun a narrative of Indian savagery and white innocence that helped make the case for the twenty Medals of Honor awarded to soldiers who took part in the bloodshed. The truth was, of course, far more complicated, as Lakota activists like Joseph Horn Cloud would prove in an effort to gain restitution and justice from the American government. Surviving Wounded Knee is an important story about what happens to a massacre site once the smoke clears, and is a testament to the power of public history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In our hyper polarized world, it is easy to assume that this is a natural state of being, the result of natural shifts in politics. In <a href="https://www.samhrosenfeld.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Rosenfeld</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpLTkhn3FvOsvogBDEmmm2cAAAFg3AUfkwEAAAFKAbuDbYY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022640725X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022640725X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=mFyGHkU47hgYhXzkbPK6YA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Polarizers: Postwar Architects of Our Partisan Era</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2018), he argues otherwise. Rosenfeld takes us back to the 1940s when another crisis of polarization dominated the headlines. Instead of too much, scholars worried about too little. No less than E. E. Schattschneider championed a debate on whether a move to more clearly identifiable parties would improve democracy through so-called &#8220;responsible parties.&#8221; Over time, informed by the ideas of political scientists, the two parties did in fact shift, taking on much clearer ideological agendas and issue positions. Unlike the 1940s, it is much clearer to voters what it means to vote for one party or the other.<br />
Rosenfeld tracks the people&#8212;the Architects in his subtitle&#8212;who initiated changes in party rules and institutions that facilitated the development of the parties. The book is rich in historical details and meaning for our current political moment.<br />
Rosenfeld is an assistant professor of political science at Colgate University.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Through sixty-three short but informative essays, Keywords for Latina/o Studies provides a common vocabulary for a field that has been in a constant state of evolution since its establishment half a century ago. Being careful not to overly circumscribe the field&#8217;s boundaries, the essays within this anthology exemplify the breadth and liveliness of the ideas, debates, and questions that drive the production of transnational, comparative, and intersectional scholarship surrounding the peoples and communities commonly referred to as Latina/o. Accessible and engaging, this collection is an essential primer and reference for anyone interested in the field of Latina/o studies.<br />

Although not popular in the United States, The Phantom knows a long history and popularity in Australia, Sweden, and India. In The Phantom Unmasked, Patrick explores this history. By tracing the publication history of The Phantom and connecting its success to the media licensing industries starting in the 1930s and 40s, Patrick presents an under-explored history to show the role of this comic in international markets and its importance for understanding how international markets worked.<br />
In The Phantom, Patrick assesses how historical, cultural, political, and economic conditions impacted The Phantom&#8217;s rise in popularity in Australia, Sweden, and India. In addition, he surveys Phans in order to explain how they have come to love the superhero. Well researched and informative, The Phantom Unmasked adds to the burgeoning comic history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://osupress.oregonstate.edu/book/legible-sovereignties">Legible Sovereignties: Rhetoric, Representations, and Native American Museums</a> (Oregon State University Press, 2017), <a href="https://english.utk.edu/people/lisa-king/">Lisa King</a> explores the ways in which rhetoric is used to represent Indigenous sovereignty and explore difficult histories related to colonialism and self-determination in museums and cultural centers. Her long-term, interdisciplinary study examines how exhibits related to these issues have evolved over a ten-year period at three different institutions: the Ziibiwing Center in Michigan, which is owned and operated by the Saginaw Chippewa tribe; the Haskell Indian Nation University&#8217;s Cultural Center and Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, which is part of the Smithsonian structure. Dr. King underscores the difficulties inherent in communicating these issues to diverse public audiences, as well as the need for consistent evaluation and reevaluation by these institutions to ensure both audience engagement and Indigenous self-representation.<br />

Pappu is The Male Animal columnist for The New York Times, and his work has appeared in Sports Illustrated and The Atlantic. Blending two interesting pennant races against the backdrop of a turbulent year in world history, Pappu examines 1968 not only as a landmark season in sports, but also views it through social, cultural and racial lenses. Denny McLain became the first pitcher to win 30 or more games in 34 seasons, and Bob Gibson posted an incredible 1.12 ERA. The Detroit Tigers would rally from a 3-1 series deficit in the World Series to win in seven games, beating Gibson in the Series&#8217; finale. But those achievements were tempered by the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. The deadlock in the Vietnam War helped topple a president, and the Democratic National Convention charged with finding his replacement dissolved into clashes between Chicago police and antiwar demonstrators. Worldwide, the Tet Offensive in Vietnam and the Soviets&#8217; crushing of dissidents in Czechoslovakia added to the turbulence. Pappu deftly juggles sports and world events to present an absorbing narrative.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It was a year that at times left Lyndon Johnson feeling as though he was living in a continuous nightmare. Yet as <a href="https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/61939" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyle Longley</a> describes in his book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvsP5OVHyUbkO69r8tl1iHsAAAFhTO4YuwEAAAFKAbNUu7s/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107193036/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1107193036&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=qmyhakDbiK-TTLhB93nIiw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LBJ&#8217;s 1968: Power, Politics, and the Presidency in America&#8217;s Year of Upheaval</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2018), it was one in which he continued to engage with the many challenges confronting his presidency as he finished his term in office. That it would be his last year as president was not certain at the beginning of it, as he was expected by everyone to run for another term in the upcoming presidential election. Yet as Longley explains, health concerns and the divisions caused by the Vietnam War led Johnson to contemplate announcing during the State of the Union address that he would not seek another term. Even after he made his decision official in March, he continued to pursue an ambitious agenda that included new Great Society legislation, arms negotiations with the Soviets, and the nomination of his friend Abe Fortas as the next chief justice of the Supreme Court. Longley shows how a combination of Johnson&#8217;s lame duck status and events beyond his control often combined to frustrate his intentions, while his desire to avoid a scandal by not publicizing information about the Nixon campaign&#8217;s interference in the ongoing negotiations to end the war in Vietnam only paved the way for the even greater political crises in his successor&#8217;s administration.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Are iPhones or homes bankrupting Americans? <a href="http://qcsociology.org/people/faculty/joseph-nathan-cohen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Cohen</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qr0ttT4ICctE3uCnM1OrgLIAAAFhRCteKAEAAAFKAYC1TyE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1440832218/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1440832218&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=nZ-2.7v0EjE113ORioAq2g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Financial Crisis in American Households: The Basic Expenses That Bankrupt the Middle Class</a> (Praeger, 2017), presents data and discussion on the financial status of American households. The book considers whether capitalism or government policies are to blame. Cohen considers the historical changes that have taken place in America, including the post WWII economy, globalization, and technological advances. Rather than focus on individual spending, Cohen argues that we need to take a structural approach and also do some cross-country comparison to truly understand the financial reality of American households. This book also provides interesting discussion around how we even measure financial well-being and hardship, for instance the distinction between officially poor according to federal government limits versus relative poverty. Overall, using clear examples and data illustrations, Cohen presents a comprehensive and historical overview of the financial states of American households and provides readers with some important takeaways and questions that we must ask ourselves if we want to build a better America.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by sociologists, but also those interested in economics and public policy. It would be good for any social inequality or stratification class. It provides clear examples and typologies, which would be useful for any higher level undergraduate sociology class.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Typically the Jim Crow Era of segregation is understood as beginning directly after Reconstruction and going into the mid-twentieth century with the dual climaxes of the Brown vs. Board Supreme Court decision and the Montgomery Bus Boycott Movement in Montgomery, Alabama. What this narrative suggests is that Jim Crow was a southern phenomenon. Such a view is unfortunately ill conceived. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qk0UXxjE3VCQneGnFiGoWA0AAAFhPNdUcAEAAAFKAdd9KTM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469628570/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469628570&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=dXcchHWPLJSt83-.XPLIJQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colored Travelers: Mobility and the Fight for Citizenship before the Civil War</a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2016), written by <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/elizabeth-stordeur-pryor">Dr. Elizabeth Stordeur Pryor,</a> Associate Professor of History at Smith College, reshapes contemporary memory of when and why Jim Crow laws were enacted. In Colored Travelers, Dr. Pryor details how while antebellum-era Northern black abolitionists simultaneously fought to abolish slavery, they also pushed the limits of what citizenship meant by attempting to freely travel within it. They did this by challenging Northern Jim Crow laws set to undermine the mobility of black people in general, but this oppression hit black abolitionists most because of the mobility needed to reach their events. By using travel narratives, newspaper articles, and various primary sources of domestic and international black travel, Dr. Pryor explains why the pre-Civil War period was an essential training ground for the laws that would nationally become entrenched in the post-emancipation United States of America.<br />

She describes how the iconic military hospital orients its patients (mostly men) towards normative masculine domestic ideals in an attempt to assimilate them to ordinary life. By closely following their lives in and out of rehabilitation (clinical and domestic), Wool shows us how impossible and fraught this &#8220;ordinary&#8221; is as the men subvert and are caught between multiple desires and realities: to be home, whole, ordinary fathers and husbands, heroes and symbols of exceptionalism. The weight of life is carried by these soldiers and veterans who are asked to do so much cultural work in the service of their nation on and off the battlefield.<br />

These efforts began with the news of Roosevelt&#8217;s untimely death in 1919, which prompted a wave of assessment as to his legacy. Over the course of the next decade, proposals for memorials moved on a number of fronts, with his widow and children playing a prominent role. Cullinane explains how in the 1930s the resurgent political career of Theodore&#8217;s cousin Franklin prompted a split within the family, as the two sides warred over the meaning of Theodore&#8217;s career and who was best suited to determine it. In the 1950s the approach of the centennial of Roosevelt&#8217;s birth prompted a new round of celebrations and monuments, now increasingly shaped by a generation of Americans for whom Roosevelt was only a memory. The decades that followed demonstrated the endurance of Theodore Roosevelt as a national figure, one whose wide-ranging achievements offered something for nearly every American to admire.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The CIA is a well-known agency to say the least. It is a key part of the United States&#8217; national security apparatus and has been for the past 70 years. The CIA&#8217;s reputation is mixed though. From 1970s scandals to intelligence failures to its inherent secrecy, the agency can sometimes attract hostility and suspicion even from Americans. In his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiZR50b-Wg9gwkYUWDSG9-IAAAFg4OsIPwEAAAFKAeVPnns/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0826221378/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0826221378&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=jzF51qUQxIL2y1fwhtcYdg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Foundation of the CIA: Harry Truman, The Missouri Gang and the Origins of the Cold War</a> (University of Missouri Press, 2017), Richard E. Schroeder argues the agency filled an important hole in American national security in its creation, and does key intelligence work that must be considered in evaluating it.<br />
The Foundation of the CIA examines the creation and early years of the agency. Schroeder makes a strong argument that a centralized, permeant national intelligence agency was quite necessary for the United States. In each conflict before WWII, the United States set up systems for collecting intelligence and learned important techniques, but then lost these skills between conflicts. This loss could leave the United States vulnerable to threats when new conflicts emerged. Though the OSS, which served these needs during WWII, was terminated at the end of the war, the CIA was established shortly thereafter to meet these needs in a more permanent way. There were numerous challenges during the early years in the creation of the agency and for its first directors. Schroeder traces these foundations in his book.<br />
In this episode, Schroeder discusses his new book. He explains the need for the CIA and the important early years. Schroeder also introduces listeners to the Truman and the Missouri Gang to explain some of the important figures in these early years. Finally, Schroeder discusses the connection between this book and his own career in the CIA. His motivation to write this book stemmed from his career in the CIA and his time teaching students about national security.<br />

Historian <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/learn/departments-schools-colleges/cas/humanities/history/history-faculty-and-staff/robert-hunt-ferguson.aspx">Robert Hunt Ferguson</a>, in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qmit7DYWnKoHreUxySEkDGUAAAFhKOynMAEAAAFKAatjolg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0820351792/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0820351792&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=VdD90U2V0Ozki0O05f8hFg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remaking the Rural South: Interracialism, Christian Socialism, and Cooperative Farming in Jim Crow Mississippi</a> (University of Georgia Press, 2018), makes the surprising case that the Depression-era Mississippi Delta provided the necessary conditions for the flowering of such an endeavor. New Deal policies inspired socialist optimism while their racial exclusions left displaced tenant farmers looking for work and attracted to enterprises like Delta Cooperative Farm and Providence Farm, which promised to break them from the cycle of debt and offer them equal access to the schooling, medical care, and opportunity enjoyed by the white middle class. These cooperative farms drew inspiration from the transnational communitarian movement and advanced the radical visions of the American Socialist Party and the religious left, including celebrated theological Reinhold Niebuhr, who served as president of their board of trustees. While the experiment struggled with agro-ecological obstacles and internecine power struggles, and ultimately could not withstand the postwar attacks of white supremacist movement, Delta and Providence stand as models of how those trapped within withering hegemonies imagine a most just and free society and set out to do the daily labor of bringing it into being.<br />

Norton and Company, 2017). In the summer of 1877, General Oliver Otis Howard, a champion of African American civil rights during Reconstruction, ruthlessly pursued hundreds of Nez Perce families who resisted moving onto a reservation. Standing in his way was Chief Joseph, a young leader who never stopped advocating for Native American sovereignty and equal rights. Thunder in the Mountains is the spellbinding story of two legendary figures and their epic clash of ideas about the meaning of freedom and the role of government in American life.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the fifth podcast of Arguing History, Lynn Dumenil and Christopher Capozzola consider the relationship between America&#8217;s involvement in World War I and the granting of women the right to vote. As they note, when the war broke out women were enjoying considerable momentum at the state level, having won the right in several states. Together they discuss the impact of the war upon their efforts, looking at how the war fractured some organizations, led to the creation of new ones, and introduced new concepts of citizenship and participating into the public discourse that challenged both the suffrage movement and its opponents.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Prior to the wave of protests in 2017 supporting immigrants in the US, there were the protests of 2006. That spring, millions of Latinos and other immigrants across the country opposed Congressional action hostile to immigrants. These protesters participated in one of the largest movements to defend immigrant and civil rights in US history.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[As a United States senator in the 1930s and 1940s, Arthur Vandenberg was one of the leading Republican voices shaping the nation&#8217;s foreign policy. Though initially a staunch isolationist, as Hendrik Meijer explains in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qj7CjNCW0yHqeC7lxsEMM9IAAAFhCksehwEAAAFKAa4WfFw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022643348X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022643348X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wRxBVzKoBQmhtMcTMn9CdA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Vandenberg: The Man in the Middle of the American Century</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2017), Vandenberg eventually became one of the foremost advocates for America&#8217;s engagement with the world. As a young man Vandenberg embarked upon a career as a journalist, and soon rose to become the editor of the local newspaper in his hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. Vandenberg&#8217;s platform made him a force in state politics, and his editorials enjoyed a national readership among Republican leaders. Appointed to the Senate in 1928, Vandenberg soon made a name for himself for his ability to compromise on legislation, and with the electoral decimation of the party in Congress in the 1930s he emerged as one of its most prominent figures. Meijer details the ways in which Vandenberg used his stature to shape American policy, from his role in the drafting of the United Nations Charter to his involvement in the passage of the Marshall Plan and the treaty that established NATO.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On May 23, 1957, US Army Sergeant Robert Reynolds was acquitted of murdering Chinese officer Liu Ziran in Taiwan. Reynolds did not deny shooting Liu but claimed self-defense and, like all members of US military assistance and advisory groups, was protected under diplomatic immunity. Reynolds&#8217;s acquittal sparked a series of riots across Taiwan that became an international crisis for the Eisenhower administration and raised serious questions about the legal status of US military forces positioned around the world.<br />

Craft</a> provides a multi-archival study of the causes and consequences of the Reynolds trial and the ensuing protests. After more than a century of what they perceived as unfair treaties imposed by Western nations, the Taiwanese regarded the special legal status of resident American personnel with extreme distrust. While Eisenhower and his advisers considered Taiwan to be a vital ally against Chinese communism, the US believed that the Taiwanese government had instigated the unrest in order to protest the verdict and demand legal jurisdiction over GIs.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Brooks narrates the stories of Weetamoo, a female Wampanoag leader, and James Printer, a Nipmuc scholar, whose stories converge in the captivity of Mary Rowlandson. Through both a narrow focus on Weetamoo, Printer, and their network of relations, and a far broader scope that includes vast Indigenous geographies, Brooks leads us to a new understanding of the history of colonial New England and of American origins. Brooks&#8217;s pathbreaking scholarship is grounded not just in extensive archival research, but in the land and communities of Native New England, illuminating the actions of actors during the seventeenth century alongside an analysis of the landscape and interpretations informed by tribal history.

Portnoy describes this world as Yiddishland, a nation in which all the high and low expressions of culture not only occurred but were carefully and colorfully relayed by Yiddish journalists, including the young Isaac Bashevis Singer and his older brother, Israel Joshua Singer.<br />
A treasure for both researchers and general readership, Bad Rabbi brings to life the passionate, chaotic, and sometimes violent communal life of the Yiddish-speaking urban world that flourished prior to World War II on both sides of the Atlantic, and that was documented by some of Yiddish culture&#8217;s keenest eyes and finest writers.<br />

Laski&#8217;s complex and sophisticated text will have great appeal to political theorists and political philosophers as well as scholars of American political development and American letters and literature. Laski explores the idea of temporality in context of American democracy, and democracy generally, and the concept of progress as we often consider it in relation to post-slavery America. Untimely Democracy highlights an often-under-explored area of American politics, in the post-bellum writers and their discourse that examines a period of stasis as Reconstruction comes to an end and African-American liberty does not, in fact, expand. Laski approaches these theoretical considerations through post-Civil war writers like Stephen Crane, Pauline Hopkins, Callie House, W.E.B Dubois, Charles W. Chesnutt, Frederick Douglass and others. The thrust of this exploration is to reposition, in a sense, the concept of racial progress and the quest for liberty&#8212;providing a counter-discourse to the expected linear arc generally associated with racial progress. Laski&#8217;s examination is multilayered and examines these written and rhetorical works, especially within an analysis that explores our understanding of time, memory, recollection, and progress as an only-forward moving trajectory. This book takes the reader on a journey through concepts of temporal distinctions or horizons within a democratic quest, examining what Laski titles &#8220;untimely democracy&#8221;&#8212;neither clear progress, nor a forgetting of the past, but a consideration of democracy and the concept of expanded liberty from within a context that is bracketed in time and that explores this tension within time.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

There is Cornplanter, a leader of the Seneca Indians; George Germain, who led the British war strategy during the Revolution; Margaret Moncrieffe Coghlan, the daughter of a British major; the always worried and wearied George Washington; Venture Smith, an African slave who eventually purchased his freedom in Connecticut; and Abraham Yates, the self-taught rabble rouser from Albany who helped shape the politics of New York, and the country. With each turn in their stories, these six lives continuously remerge and recolor the text, and together make one Revolution.<br />
Shorto keeps the reader on the ground, so that we can see how the term &#8220;freedom,&#8221; among other concepts of the time, gained its meaning and importance. We feel each individual&#8217;s fight for self-determinacy, including its ugly and oppressive aspects, across their life spans.<br />
In our conversation, Shorto and I talk about the insecurities and failures, the feelings of incompleteness, and the attempts at asserting or gussying up one&#8217;s self that drive the stories of all these historical subjects. The book slips and slides into &#8216;great&#8217; events through wonderfully stark portraits of contingency, circumstance, and personality. What Shorto&#8217;s approach makes viscerally clear, and what we return to as we talk, is that no one person determined the Revolution more than any other, and no individual view contains all. This matters for the very reason that this Revolution song is no fiction. It is a history with many parts in contrapuntal relation that resolve only to hear a new dissonance and seek another resolution. It is a song we continue to sing.<br />

That is what historian <a href="https://www.lakeforest.edu/academics/faculty/mccammack/index.php">Brian McCammack</a> endeavors to find out in his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qhg74VLC-hdWCRjrSLOT-CIAAAFg522nzgEAAAFKATGCyVA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674976371/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0674976371&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=yieEirHgd9KcMmQ0JcLBRA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landscapes of Hope: Nature and the Great Migration in Chicago</a> (Harvard University Press, 2017). McCammack&#8217;s study is the first book-length environmental history of black Chicago and the first sustained exploration of the how the 1.6 million black southerners who moved to northern cities between 1910 and 1940 thought about and interacted with the natural world. He follows black Chicagoans&#8217; through both the greenspaces of the South Side and rural retreats across the Upper Midwest. He finds their experiences of nature were shaped by racial exclusion, intraracial class conflict, and paternalistic reform efforts. Many of their preferred forms of outdoor recreation blended southern traditions with new practices coded as modern. And they articulated their devotion to nature in terms often indistinguishable from white northerners, raising troubling questions about why postwar environmentalism ended up overwhelmingly white.<br />
Brian McCammack is Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at Lake Forest College in suburban Chicago. He earned his Ph.D. in the History of American Civilization at Harvard University in 2012.<br />

Brian Hamilton is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin, Madison where he is researching African American environmental history in the nineteenth-century Cotton South.

Men like the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Minister Malcolm X or Martin Delany and Marcus Garvey are notable examples.

Women like Clara Muhammad, Burnsteen Sharrieff, and Thelma X Muhammad were essential to the development of the Nation of Islam&#8217;s goal of creating a black nation within the American nation. The Promise of Patriarchy shows how black women created notions of black womanhood and black motherhood that best helped them deal with the daily indignities of living in Jim Crow America.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Every young generation inspires a host of comparisons&#8212;usually negative ones&#8212;with older generations. Whether preceding a criticism or punctuating one, &#8220;kids these days&#8221; is a common utterance. Perhaps because of the ubiquity of the internet and their heavy presence on it, Millennials have been the most parsed and monitored generation as its members are still in the process of coming of age in history. Stereotypes abound in the media and popular culture: Millennials are lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and immature. Synthesizing an array of social science research that has been conducted not just on this cohort but on the society they find themselves struggling to navigate, writer <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/contributor/malcolm-harris/">Malcolm Harris</a> in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qgpbb4EVEl3x6ZSIy2CoNzUAAAFg5ZgxzQEAAAFKAaQb3rg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316510866/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0316510866&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=r3TlNOnFL-tlUlEGtf9l0g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials</a> (Little, Brown and Company, 2017) aims to get readers to question these stereotypes and myths and instead think about how Millennials are trying to survive within today&#8217;s shifting social structures and conditions. More than any other generation, Millennials have been raised to think of everything they do as a way to build human capital and invest in their own future. And they do so at time in American history when higher education is becoming increasingly expensive as wages are declining, work is becoming more precarious and less stable, and the future of the social safety net is showing signs of either eroding or at least completely transforming in the future. In short, the book refreshingly considers the forces that have helped shape who Millennials are and why they behave and think as they do. With luck, it will encourage a discussion of the root causes behind serious problems that this young cohort confronts (precarity, youth poverty, over-medication, and over-work) and their possible solutions instead of the same tired stereotypes.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For many people today, the name Abraham Lincoln conjures up a mental image of a solemn but kindly statesman. Yet to his contemporaries, one of Lincoln&#8217;s defining traits was his humor, which he deployed to great effect throughout his career. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlvgaxLQnVmHLGAk421LI3cAAAFgty3lWgEAAAFKARFkf38/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0809336146/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0809336146&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=t85IOLhGM1txi6X-GIBzSQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lincoln&#8217;s Sense of Humor</a> (Southern Illinois University Press, 2017), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Carwardine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Carwardine</a> examines the role humor played in Lincoln&#8217;s life. Lincoln grew up in a family of storytellers, and had a healthy appetite for jokes and humorous stories. These he employed both in the courtroom and on the campaign trail in his appeals to people, to the point where he became famous for his wit. As Carwardine explains, Lincoln often used humor not just to amuse his audience, but to offer a moral critique of his targets that could be both gentle and pointed at the same time. Though Democrats criticized Lincoln during the war for resorting to humor during inappropriate times, it served as an important balm to the president as he struggled with the miseries of war and the challenges of reconciliation.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/people/seth-barrett-tillman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seth Barrett Tillman</a>, an instructor in the Department of Law at Maynooth University in Ireland, is one of the few scholars to have researched and written about the history of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Prof. Tillman has also submitted amicus briefs (friend of the court briefs) in three recent federal cases regarding whether President Trump has violated the clause. In this podcast interview, Prof. Tillman discusses the historical origins of the clause, its original understanding during the early republic, and its possible application to the Trump presidency. In short, Prof. Tillman contends that the clause does not apply to elective offices; rather, it only applies to appointed offices in the federal government. Although conceding that there are good reasons to want such a clause to apply to the President, he contends that it is simply not a proper understanding of the clause to apply it to President Trump.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Dykstra" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gretchen Dykstra</a>&#8216;s career to date has been both impressive and wide-ranging. She was the founding President of the Times Square Alliance, the former Commissioner of the NYC Department of Consumer Affairs, and the founding President of the 9/11 Memorial Foundation. She is also a writer, and in this New Books in Folklore episode, she is interviewed about her biography of her grandfather, Franz Rickaby, which features in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qq5L40NDk-j7hjB7Nm7KgfQAAAFg3ShX1gEAAAFKAR60-74/http://www.amazon.com/dp/029931264X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=029931264X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=FurQpKOB2YAmY8NgOMfpFA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinery Boys: Songs and Songcatching in the Lumberjack Era</a> (University of Wisconsin Press, 2017)<br />
Franz Rickaby was a young folk music collector and fiddler and between 1919 and 1923, he travelled extensively around the Upper Midwest, seeking out the songs and stories of logging industry workers. Even as he embarked on his venture, the region&#8217;s lumber business was in stark decline. Most of the original pine forests that had covered the area had been clear cut by that time, but although the environment had been depleted, a rich cache of folkloric material remained. Rickaby set about preserving this material&#8212;songs, ballads, and stories&#8212;in manuscript form and then presented in his seminal work Ballads and Songs of the Shanty-Boy. This tome provided, as folklorist James P. Leary writes in his introduction to Pinery Boys, &#8220;the foundation for our understanding of North Americas Anglophone lumberjack folksongs, song-makers, and singers&#8221; (3).<br />
Alas, Rickaby himself died aged 35 shortly before Ballads and Songs of the Shanty-Boy appeared in print leaving the prominent Harvard-based folklorist George Kittredge to oversee its publication which took place in 1926. Rickaby&#8217;s wife Lillian, who had urged Kittredge to take up the task, wrote elsewhere that although she was sorry that her husband had not lived to see the finished product, &#8220;what are books to those who walk among the stars?&#8221; (70).<br />
Gretchen Dykstra&#8217;s biography of her grandfather forms a significant part of Pinery Boys and offers valuable insight into the life and motivations of a man about whom little was previously known. Pinery Boys also includes the republication of Rickaby&#8217;s Ballads and Songs of the Shanty-Boy, along with other material he collected but which fell outside of the purview of his major work. In addition, and as mentioned earlier, the book&#8217;s introduction, which provides valuable context, is written by the University of Wisconsin&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Leary" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James P. Leary</a>. Leary, himself a distinguished scholar of the folk music of the Upper Midwest, also provides illuminating annotations to Rickaby&#8217;s work.<br />
Incidentally, during the course of her New Books in Folklore interview, Dykstra mentions a recent recording of songs collected by her grandfather as performed by Brian Miller. More information about this recording, which is entitled Minnesota Lumberjack Songs: Irish and Scottish Music from the North Woods, can be found <a href="https://uwpress.wisc.edu/books/5102.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br />

Would Japan&#8217;s remarkable post World War II economic success enable the East Asian nation to overtake the United States? Or could Japan&#8217;s globe-trotting corporations serve as a model for battered U.S. industries, pointing the way to a future of globalized commerce and culture? While popular films and literature recycled old anti-Asian imagery and crafted new ways of imagining the yellow peril, and formal U.S.-Japan relations remained locked in a holding pattern of Cold War complacency, a remarkable shift was happening in countless local places throughout the United States: Japanese goods were remaking American consumer life and injecting contemporary globalization into U.S. commerce and culture. What impact did the flood of billions of Japanese things have on the ways Americans produced, consumed, and thought about their place in the world?<br />
From autoworkers to anime fans, Consuming Japan introduces new unorthodox actors into foreign-relations history, demonstrating how the flow of all things Japanese contributed to the globalizing of America in the late twentieth century.<br />

Rozell is the dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. Wilcox is professor of government at Georgetown University.<br />
For decades, Rozell and Wilcox have connected the study of religion and politics to elections. The latest iteration of this series, God at the Grassroots 2016, again brings together a distinguished group of political scientists to examine the 2016 elections.<br />
The chapter authors focus on changes in the religious right movement since the 1980s. They begin with the national context, then turn to state-specific chapters. They conclude with lessons learned from the studies of the religious right in the elections from 1994 through 2016 and address directions for continued research on the subject.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Sovereignty emerges in this study as a necessarily imprecise concept that mediates between indigenous communities and also with the settler colonial government of the United States. Carlson discusses thinkers who have previously been seen as opposed, showing ways that their disparate projects can in fact be seen via the idea of self-determination as in many ways complementary.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[A city in its original state is arbitrary and has no meaning. The act of placemaking is a multifaceted process in the planning, designing, and management of public spaces. The social construction of meaning is a process that capitalizes on the assets, inspiration, and potential of a public space. This meaning is constructed from the social and emotional sentiments that people evoke from the city. The structural and physical aspects of the city are less important. <a href="https://www.umass.edu/sociology/users/wynn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan R. Wynn</a>, the author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QmXNh88xzjreTfb3K_jmfzUAAAFgnnRThwEAAAFKAbrhwbE/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022630552X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022630552X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=YWegFMPWJC8lJMhh4clLTw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Music/City: American Festivals and Placemaking in Austin, Nashville, and Newport</a> (University of Chicago, 2015) and my guest for this episode, studied the process of placemaking through observing major music festivals for the cities of Austin, Texas; Nashville, Texas; and Newport, Rhode Island. In our interview, we discuss how this study was shaped from his past study on tour guides and how community members serve as major contributors to placemaking. Wynn also shares his thoughts on the current climate of music festivals in the United States compared to Canada.<br />

The book offers both inspiration and guidance, weaving together passages from Torah and Talmud, insights from contemporary Jewish and non-Jewish civic leaders, and practical advice drawn from the authors many years of advocacy, activism, and civic collaboration in their home community of Charlotte, North Carolina.<br />
In this episode, we discuss how the idea of minyan can work as a model for social movements; we discuss the stages congregations can follow to embark on a civic project; and, we discuss how to avoid community division while still encouraging healthy debate &#8212; which, along with supporting the needy, is as authentic and ancient a Jewish tradition as one can find.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Much attention has been drawn to the role of white women in the recent Alabama senate election and the earlier election of Donald J. Trump as president. Today&#8217;s racial and gender politics have long historic roots, according to <a href="https://www.wcu.edu/learn/departments-schools-colleges/cas/humanities/history/history-faculty-and-staff/elizabeth-mcrae.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth McRae</a>, the author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrMvKys4teTs8RhcRrWlt4QAAAFgZnf8HQEAAAFKAXT3KDM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/019027171X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=019027171X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=dl0xxjXm2OIy7YqWkx7jSg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mothers of Massive Resistance: White Women and the Politics of White Supremacy</a> (Oxford University Press, 2018). Gillespie McRae is an associate professor of history and director of the graduate social science education programs at Western Carolina University.<br />
Examining racial segregation from 1920s to the 1970s, Mothers of Massive Resistance explores the local workers who promoted the system of racial segregation and Jim Crow. In rural communities and cities, white women performed various duties that upheld segregation and racism: rejecting marriage certificates, deciding on the racial identity of neighbors, canvassing communities for votes, and lobbying elected officials. And the work of white women was not restricted to the South. McRae also shows how this politics of Massive Resistance to de-segregation and civil rights plays out in cities in the North.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Situated in Colorado Springs she reconstructs the life of her shrewd and ambitious grandfather Walter Davis, who emerged from virtually nowhere to become a small town finance man running the City Savings Building and Loan Association. He gained and betrayed the trust of hundreds of depositors who invested their life savings to secure the American dream of homeownership and financial security. They found their lives destroyed by an unregulated industry and Davis&#8217;s dishonest practices. Shortfall is both the story of American capitalism told from the bottom up and of Echols uncovering her own family secrets of ill-gotten gain, decadence, scandal, loss, and ultimate despair that reflected the lives of millions across the nation. Shortfall offers lessons in the dangers associated with small-town finance men, land speculators, depositors in denial, ill-equipped investigators, inexperienced judges and an unregulated financial marketplace.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Technology is a form of material culture and is a human activity. The way in which humans view technology is a social construction in which people use social processes of interpretation and negotiation. The mundane rituals that humans carry out when interacting with technology are loaded with emotional overtones. The interaction with technology in most cases become habit. The dependence and isolation that result from technology use is invisible and seems natural to membership groups that use it. Chelsea Schelly, the author of <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqIFQOxp_r_dGVRfDZ8o2N0AAAFgnl6vOQEAAAFKAVh5PaY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/081358650X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=081358650X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=dS8Am8rkPY6ujd9sDVXp8g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwelling in Resistance: Living with Alternative Technologies in America</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2017) and my guest for this episode, studied technology and the way in which people of four alternative lifestyles live without such dependency on technology. In our interview, we discuss the way in which people at The Farm, Twin Oaks, Dancing Rabbits, and Earthship Biotecture lived their daily lives by sharing some technology and living without most of it.<br />
<a href="https://www.mtu.edu/social-sciences/department/faculty/schelly/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea Schelly</a>, Ph.D. is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Michigan Technological University in Houghton.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How do we use words to tease out the &#8220;real&#8221; that history strives to capture? Listen to my conversation with Stephen Cushman, as we consider the historian&#8217;s art through Cushman&#8217;s book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qmbn6axY9cR85m1e5i-5YmAAAAFgiolvHAEAAAFKAapGGbc/http://www.amazon.com/dp/146961877X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=146961877X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=ZJ9DoaypXqTTNsR7jFwpOw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Belligerent Muse: Five Northern Writers and How They Shaped Our Understanding of the Civil War</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469633398/belligerent-muse/">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2014).<br />
<a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu/people/sbc9g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stephen Cushman</a> is Robert C. Taylor Professor of English at the University of Virginia. In addition to critical scholarly work on poetics and form, he has published five collections of poetry, and another book on the Civil War, Bloody Promenade: Reflections on a Civil War Battle. That is the Battle of the Wilderness, the bloody field of which Cushman lives in close proximity, where it has prodded him over the years to reflect on the history that flows unheeded through our lives, until, at moments, it erupts.<br />
In Belligerent Muse, Cushman is interested, and points us with gentle precision, to the act of writing: thinking, deliberating, trying out words and phrases, composing the scene&#8212;as the main event of the text, and perhaps the main event of history itself. How do we get the world into words? That is the underlying provocation of our hour-long conversation. Along the way, we ask about the stakes and challenges of such a feat, as well as what constitutes a success and what a failure in the terms of &#8220;history.&#8221; In citing Walt Whitman&#8217;s famous assessment that &#8220;the real war will never get in the books,&#8221; Cushman places stress on the books. Surely something has gotten in the books. And so, during our conversation, we ask how the &#8220;real&#8221; of experience, if not representable in a positive, delimited sense, is made real through how exactly it leaves its imprint in our words. We reference examples Cushman uses in his book&#8212;which include the well-known speeches of Lincoln, the prose and poetry of Whitman, and the short stories of Ambrose Bierce, as well as the largely forgotten memoirs of Union Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain&#8212;and touch on themes such as the individual as representational, the effects of a literary culture in writing history (and reading history as something other than fiction), and the place of ambivalence, or the unknown at the core of the historical methods search for truth. &#8220;The real&#8221; is, finally, not fully containable by any one writer or work. Eventually, words are all that remain. As Cushman so deftly demonstrates, we can all strive to discern how they drag along the material traces of the past, and better attune ourselves to the real with which those words stand aquiver.<br />

Using interviews and ethnographic data, Fields investigates how identity, race, and politics work together and influence each other. He finds two different lenses through which respondents see their Republican values: color-blind or race-conscious. Those who have a color-blind approach to their politics try not to emphasize race at all. In contrast, the race-conscious approach brings race to the forefront of any political argument. This book presents a fascinating case study. In addition to his interviews, Fields also presents historical background on the participation of African Americans in the Republican party across time and current day Black Republican organizations. Fields encourages the reader to move past seeing Black Republicans as a monolith, and instead appreciate the ways in which they are a heterogeneous group. Fields also encourages the reader to understand the ways in which politics may influence racial identity and vice versa.<br />
This book will be of interest to sociologists, political scientists, and race scholars. Given the concepts used and the ideas raised in the book, it would be especially useful in a sociology of race class or political sociology course.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1976, the US Supreme Court ruled in Gregg v. Georgia that the death penalty was constitutional if it complied with certain provisions designed to ensure that it was reserved for the &#8216;worst of the worst.&#8217; The 1976 decision ushered in the &#8216;modern&#8217; period of the US death penalty, resulting in the execution of over 1,400 inmates, with over 8,000 individuals currently sentenced to die.

Ford</a> (University Press of Kansas, 2017), <a href="http://www.fmarion.edu/directory/kaufman-scott/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Kaufman</a> recounts the life and career of this often misunderstood leader. He sees the roots of Ford&#8217;s political ideology in his Michigan youth, where his stepfather and namesake stressed the importance of hard work and individual achievement. After working as a lawyer and serving in the navy during World War II Ford won election to Congress, where he set his sights on becoming Speaker of the House of Representatives. Frustrated in his aspirations, Ford was in the seeming twilight of his career when he was nominated to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president after Agnew&#8217;s resignation in 1973. Within eight months Richard Nixon&#8217;s resignation brought Ford to the presidency itself, where he grappled with the consequences of numerous shifts taking place both nationally and throughout the world. Though Ford aspired to election in his own right, his decision to pardon Nixon defined him to an increasingly cynical populace in ways that ultimately proved too difficult to overcome, contributing to his defeat in the 1976 presidential election.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Black Power was one of the most iconic movements of the twentieth century. Recent documentary treatments like The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 in 2011 and The Black Panthers: Vanguards of the Revolution in 2015 brought the Panthers into the households of a new generation. When combined with Beyonce&#8217;s 2016 Super Bowl halftime performance, the Black Power movement&#8217;s memory hit a high note upon its fiftieth anniversary. Ashley D. Farmer&#8217;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjrwEEZuclvbPZKO1eKtUUYAAAFgayQVqQEAAAFKARbdUsY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469634376/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469634376&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=TkMgik9uwA2Qz39E7JOSvw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remaking Black Power: How Black Women Transformed an Era</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469634371/remaking-black-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press Press</a>, 2017) increases scholarly and mainstream audiences&#8217; knowledge of black women&#8217;s centrality in theorizing and organizing Black Power and black nationalist circles throughout the majority of the twentieth century. Not only does Farmer&#8217;s work push our grasp of the black women who influenced the Black Power Movement from within, but Remaking Black Power is also the first comprehensive study of black women&#8217;s intellectual production throughout the Black Power era.<br />
What makes Remaking Black Power such a compelling history is that it uses similar source material as prior scholars, but Farmer uses them much differently. Accessing untapped sources of cartoons, political manifestos, and political essays, Farmer asserts that they were important sites which redefined black womanhood and ultimately black thought in general. As the Black Power movement grew throughout the world, black women were central to the movement&#8217;s expansive visions of black freedom and political organizing. Ultimately, Remaking Black Power deepens our understanding of what black intellectual history is, and what groups are considered &#8220;intellectuals.&#8221;<br />

Paul is a baseball historian and a member of the Society for American Baseball Research. He has also written The American League in Transition, 1965-1975: How Competition Thrived When the Yankees Didn&#8217;t, and has written for NINE: A Journal of Baseball History and Culture and the Baseball Research Journal. Hensler, who owns a masters degree in history, examines the issues that were percolating not only in Major League Baseball as the 1960s drew to a close, but also the political, social and cultural upheaval caused by the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement and the baby boomers who were coming of age. Baseball was on the verge of expansion, was dealing with an ineffective commissioner and was in the early stages of a labor movement that would radically change the game. American society and culture were in flux, Hensler writes, and armed with meticulous research and a wealth of sources, he presents a view of baseball history that has been overlooked. From the &#8220;Year of the Pitcher&#8221; to the &#8220;Amazin&#8217; Mets,&#8221; Hensler takes the reader through one of the most turbulent years in American history. It was a line of demarcation for baseball, too, and Hensler provides a refreshing narrative.<br />

In the last decades of the 16th and first decades of the 17th century, three empires&#8212;Spain, France and England&#8212;each sought to establish new colonial projects on the continent of North America. They had the misfortune to embark on these projects at the most severe point of a global climatic shift called the Little Ice Age, whose harsh winters, droughts and storms seemed to plague the unready Europeans at every turn. From Florida to Maine, North Carolina to New Mexico, climate and weather-related difficulties challenged European colonists in a multitude of ways, and White explains how even the nominally successful colony projects, like Jamestown, were lucky near-misses whose success was by no means inevitable. This is a totally new look at the early history of Europeans in North America, which holds significant lessons for coping with and thinking about our modern problems of anthropogenic climate change.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What were the dreams of the Civil War? Find out by listening to my conversation with Jonathan White about his new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrAdcRy1w0VfsGx2YNTNxP8AAAFgVjMmLgEAAAFKAaUx71I/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469632047/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469632047&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=.A9PpRvfA.NmuiPYjq1-dg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight in America: Darkness, Sleep, and Dreams during the Civil War</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469632049/midnight-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2017).<br />
<a href="http://www.jonathanwhite.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan W. White</a> is associate professor of American Studies at Christopher Newport University. He is the author of several books and almost one hundred articles, essays, and reviews about the Civil War. His earlier book, Emancipation, the Union Army, and the Reelection of Abraham Lincoln, was the winner and finalist for a number of book prizes.<br />
Now he has written a book about a subject few, if anyone, has known much about&#8212;and that in itself is a feat for Civil War history. Midnight in America surveys the dreams of soldiers, civilians, African Americans, the dying, and Abraham Lincoln, including how those dreams were represented in popular culture. The dreams he includes are truly strange, with all the wacky juxtapositions we expect in our own dreaming. Indeed, what White&#8217;s book shows overall is that it is the dreams during the Civil War, and not any more the wakeful, sober analyses of official accounts, that most clearly reveal the life of the country, with all its fears, desires, and struggles.<br />
Soldiers&#8217; dreams of home (the most prominent &#8216;theme&#8217; of their dreams) pivoted around feelings of vulnerability and mortality, and, consequently, the need for care and affection. We talk about how their dreams harbored fears of being cheated upon, forgotten, no longer important, and even replaced&#8212;fears many times instigated by not having received a letter from home recently. Dreaming is how we get through the day, even as, in their most free-ranging forms, dreams can reveal that which we are trying to escape. As we discuss in our conversation, surveying the content of these dreams offers a view of the emotional dynamics that underwrote &#8216;the war,&#8217; as well as the dreamer&#8217;s drive to fight. We also discuss the differences between white and black cultures of dreaming. The stark divides of the relationships that appeared in the dreams of soldiers and their families back home were on full display in the daily lives of slaves. In contrast to white people, African-Americans gave dreaming a more central, ritualistic place in their cultural practices. And while in public slaveowners presented a &#8216;rational&#8217; defense of slavery, their dreams evinced a complex recognition of the humanity of black people. The very &#8220;dream&#8221; of a perfect union, with clear differences between good and evil, especially as sentimentalized in popular culture, was premised on the fear of disunion, disconnection, and incompleteness in ones own life. For better and worse, the war was a dream.<br />

 Michael Amico holds a PhD in American Studies from Yale University. His dissertation, &#8220;The Forgotten Union of the Two Henrys: The True Story of the Peculiar and Rarest Intimacy of the American Civil War,&#8221; is about the romance between Henry Clay Trumbull and Henry Ward Camp of the Tenth Connecticut Regiment. He is the author, with Michael Bronski and Ann Pellegrini, of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Can-Tell-Just-Looking/dp/0807042455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;You Can Tell Just by Looking&#8221;: And 20 Other Myths about LGBT Life and People (Beacon, 2013)</a>, a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award in Nonfiction.]]></itunes:summary>

It is part of a series called <a href="https://rowman.com/Action/SERIES/RL/RLSIIPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports Icons and Issues in Popular Culture</a>. Abrams, an archivist of electronic records in Washington. D.C., does more than just document the football career of Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw, who won four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Abrams goes beyond the nuts and bolts of a successful athletic career and explores Bradshaw&#8217;s foray into country and gospel singing, his acting in movies, his adventure as a part owner of a NASCAR team, and finally, his long and successful run as a NFL color commentator and later a studio analyst first for CBS, and then for Fox. Maligned during his playing career for a perceived lack of intelligence&#8212;a prejudicial view of Southerners mostly held by people north of the Mason-Dixon line, Bradshaw played off his L&#8217;il Abner, good o&#8217;l boy image to craft his own niche in the entertainment field. As Abrams writes in this well-researched book, Bradshaw demonstrated what it took for an entertainer to master many of those entertainment industries in the late 20th century. More people may now know Bradshaw as an enthusiastic football analyst, but he is much more than that.<br />

With its careful attention to the historiography of the rebellion, its consideration of the veracity of &#8220;The Confessions of Nat Turner&#8221; (the primary source that serves as the center of studies on the rising), and its treatment of how churches reacted to the rising, this work is not only of interest to scholars, but could easily be adopted into a college-level survey of American history or a course introducing the historian&#8217;s craft.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Most scholars and members of the public believe the process of enslavement was confined to the Western Hemispheric plantation or other locations of enslavement. <a href="https://history.artsci.wustl.edu/mustakeem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sowande Mustakeem&#8217;</a>s award-winning <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqjC7PNh9z3fAVCWU-U8Eu8AAAFgTGmNAwEAAAFKAa_3L9g/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252082028/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0252082028&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=2WUMUQJN-lFUYWcYwtoUdA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slavery at Sea: Terror, Sex, and Sickness in the Middle Passage</a> (<a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/88pnz5xm9780252040559.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Illinois Press</a>, 2016) disrupts that narrative. Mustakeem changes how readers understand the packaging process for how African captives became enslaved once they reached their final destinations. Slavery at Sea reveals for the first time how similar dimensions of land-based slavery were expressed largely on board slaving vessels. By highlighting the lived experiences of those groups most neglected by prior scholars of the Middle Passage&#8212;women, children, the disabled, and the elderly&#8212;Mustakeem demonstrates how Atlantic slave ships were important areas of development to land-based methods of medical treatment and violence.<br />
Mustakeem&#8217;s approach to producing history does not end with the writing of Slavery at Sea. As a member of the St. Louis, Missouri-based band Amalghemy, Mustakeem adds to the readers experience by constructing a first of its kind soundtrack specifically for them to listen to as they read. Slavery At Sea: The Book Soundtrack pushes the public to consider how a soundtrack could mirror the &#8220;feelings, vibrations, and imagination forged in the book.&#8221; Ultimately, when coupled together, Slavery At Sea and Slavery At Sea: The Book Soundtrack alters how people of all backgrounds understand how pivotal the Middle Passage was to one of, if not the largest forced migrations of people in human history. She asserts that by the time captive Africans ultimately reached their final port of entry, the psychological and sexual trauma that would be their futures as enslaved people, had already begun during the Middle Passage.<br />

Nabors examines the writings and speeches of Republicans in the Thirty-Eighth, Thirty-Ninth, and Fortieth Congress (1863-1869), recovering their political analysis of the antebellum South. While Reconstruction scholars have typically emphasized black citizenship as the central concern of congressional Republicans, Nabors demonstrates that they identified Southern oligarchy (tightly linked to slavery) as the problem of the age.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

As Head explains, these privateers, most of whom were American citizens, existed in a complex environment of international politics, diplomacy, and economic activity. Operating in violation of U.S. law, they evaded the authorities in a variety of ways, from clandestine operations in the Louisiana bayous to deceptive claims to port authorities in Baltimore. While U.S. officials were often frustrated in their efforts to enforce the law, Head finds that civil claims were often pursued by the attacked merchants with greater success. It was only with the end of the wars, though, that the activities of these privateers came to an end, leaving them to embark upon lives often changed by their dramatic experiences.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Batchelor has written the first biography of Stan Lee. Starting with his childhood as a Depression-era New Yorker born to immigrant parents, Batchelor follows Lee&#8217;s career as a teenage editor at Marvel Comics, his stint as a playwright for the United States Army during World War II, and his unrelenting work ethic and drive that transformed the comic book industry and brought characters such as Spider Man, the Hulk, Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and the X-Men to life. Batchelor explores the larger place in popular and American cultural history that Stan Lee has played over the past 70 years from comics to television to film, reflecting on the role of the superhero in the American experience. Well researched, Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel gives insight not only into well-known aspects of Lee&#8217;s life, but also presents readers with little known background into Lee&#8217;s past and what has made him the icon he is today. Batchelor&#8217;s book is a must read for Marvel and comic books fans.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Studio 54 opened its doors 40 years ago and since that time it has held a place in American popular culture. Studio 54 was the place to go dancing to great music, mingle with celebrities and beautiful people, and do drugs night after night. In his historical and cultural memoir as the owner of Studio 54, Mark Fleischman takes readers behind the scenes and the into the basement rooms and dark corners of the night club. <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qs7EMkx1sS1QVRALn_BIGF8AAAFgDtG3wgEAAAFKAfTq0Aw/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1945572574/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1945572574&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=.E96ydgt8Z9MfpkdIJdegA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inside Studio 54: The Real Story of Sex, Drugs, and Rock &#8216;n Roll from Former Studio 54 Owner</a> (<a href="http://www.rarebirdbooks.com/inside-studio-54-by-mark-fleischman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rare Bird Books</a>, 2017) introduces readers to the Studio 54 of the 1980s which Fleischman took control over after the original owners went to jail for tax evasion. Fleischman shares stories of celebrities, drugs, and day in and day out partying. He presents how he initiated theme nights and created ways to make the night club a destination for cultural icons of the decade. Through his journey of making Studio 54 the in club of the 1980s after disco was declared dead, Fleischman also shares his story of addiction and recovery, finding a new life through Rancho La Puerta and sobriety.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Wile E. Coyote has a family tree with many roots and branches, argues<a href="http://hs.umt.edu/history/people/emeriti-faculty.php?s=Flores" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> University of Montana A.B. Hammond Professor Emeritus</a> <a href="http://www.projectcoyote.org/about/ambassadors/dan-flores/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dan Flores</a> in his recent book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrRS1j4Qg-UEJQ-zk-FGf6MAAAFgLafAAwEAAAFKAQmExcA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465052991/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0465052991&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=MSJEv.RDM-a5bhSexcBpng&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coyote America: A Natural and Supernatural History</a> (Basic Books, 2016). Coyotes as a species predate humans in North America, and people have been, by turns, fascinated and horrified by coyotes for as long as the two creatures have coexisted. The coyote&#8217;s relationship with humans has been, as Flores describes it, a rollercoaster. Considered a semi-deity figure and trickster god among many Indigenous cultures across the American West, the first Europeans to encounter the coyote were puzzled by the animal. Lewis and Clark struggled to fit coyotes into existing categories; was it a jackal, or closer to a wolf? By the end of the nineteenth century however, Americans had largely decided the coyote was, above all, a nuisance and took up arms to eradicate the animal. The effects were both gruesome and surprising. While government-laid traps and poisons killed millions of coyotes, many thousands also migrated to cities as a means of escaping the attempted extermination. Today, coyotes can be found in every American state save Hawaii and have even crossed their final frontier into New York City. Coyote America traces the history of this nigh-mystical animal (an &#8220;American Avatar&#8221; in Flores&#8217;s estimation) and their long, tortured, relationship with humans.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[With the end of the Civil War, George Crook&#8217;s decision to continue serving in the United States Army meant reverting to a lower rank and assuming a command in the Pacific Northwest. Yet, as Paul Magid details in the second volume of his biography of Crook, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrkJXnOLxqc8oLh88Vk1KB8AAAFgKJGDGQEAAAFKARM3TLU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806147067/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0806147067&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=LM9ZoLvOkUM-DXQ4G07sKg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gray Fox: George Crook and the Indian Wars</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2015), he would soon emerge as one of the most prominent figures in the army&#8217;s ongoing operations against Native Americans in the territories. In describing Crook&#8217;s campaign against the Paiutes in the Great Basin, Magid details the relentless attritional warfare that was a hallmark of his strategy against the tribes he fought. Results in the Northwest led to his transfer to Arizona, where his success against the Apache and Yavapai earned him a promotion to the rank of brigadier general. With his selection as the head of the Department of the Platte in 1875, Crook found himself coping with the deteriorating situation in the Dakota Territory created by the surge of prospectors and settlers, and with the outbreak of the war against the Sioux, the general took to the field in a series of grueling campaigns. Though suffering a setback at the battle of Rosebud, Crook&#8217;s subsequent victory at Slim Buttes led to the subjugation of the Sioux and the surrender of Crazy Horse, which cemented Crook&#8217;s reputation as the army&#8217;s leading expert in Indian warfare.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I was joined by <a href="http://haifa.academia.edu/EliCook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eli Cook</a> from Israel to talk about his amazing new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qjroxeey0JGmhBOL7hW-ryYAAAFf9DW7kQEAAAFKAeX4nW8/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674976282/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0674976282&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Fg5QqUvv-E2K-JxZX2fyoQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pricing of Progress: Economic Indicators and the Capitalization of American Life</a> (Harvard University Press, 2017). While economists and politicians are busy discussing alternative measures of progress, Eli Cook traces the long history that brought us to use the GDP as a measure of growth, success, power, wellbeing. This is not only the history of technical metrics, this is the history of ideas and of a dominant paradigm. According to the author the invention of GDP was the final step not only in the pricing of progress but also the capitalization of American life.<br />
How did Americans come to quantify their society&#8217;s progress and well-being in units of money? In today&#8217;s GDP-run world, prices are the standard measure of not only our goods and commodities but our environment, our communities, our nation, even our self-worth.The Pricing of Progress traces the long history of how and why we moderns adopted the monetizing values and valuations of capitalism as an indicator of human prosperity while losing sight of earlier social and moral metrics that did not put a price on everyday life.<br />
Eli Cook roots the rise of economic indicators in the emergence of modern capitalism and the contested history of English enclosure, Caribbean slavery, American industrialization, economic thought, and corporate power. He explores how the maximization of market production became the chief objective of American economic and social policy.<br />
As economic elites quantified the nation as a for-profit, capitalized investment, the progress of its inhabitants, free or enslaved, came to be valued according to their moneymaking abilities. The book is a beautiful and enjoyable account of how capitalism shaped our societies: not only introducing a new social order of production and consumption but also through a new way of measuring the value of our economies, of our societies and, eventually, of ourselves.<br />

Brooks</a>, UC Santa Barbara Professor of History and Anthropology and the William S. Vaughn Visiting Fellow at Vanderbilt University&#8217;s Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities, offers a scrupulously researched investigation of the mysterious massacre of Hopi Indians at Awat&#8217;ovi as well as the event&#8217;s echo through American history in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiU-q4WM5e8iXqEQ6utPzroAAAFgKIaePwEAAAFKAUdUIyk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393061256/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0393061256&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Rb2kPRCO6KpabdoOrHPy6Q&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mesa of Sorrows: A History of the Awat&#8217;ovi Massacre</a> (<a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Mesa-of-Sorrows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W.W. Norton &amp; Company</a>, 2016).<br />
The Hopi community of Awat&#8217;ovi existed peacefully on Arizona&#8217;s Antelope Mesa for generations until one bleak morning in the fall of 1700&#8212;raiders from nearby Hopi villages descended on Awat&#8217;ovi, slaughtering their neighboring men, women, and children. While little of the pueblo itself remains, five centuries of history lie beneath the low rises of sandstone masonry, and theories about the events of that night are as persistent as the desert winds. The easternmost town on Antelope Mesa, Awat&#8217;ovi was renowned for its martial strength, and had been the gateway to the entire Hopi landscape for centuries. Why did kinsmen target it for destruction?<br />
Drawing on oral traditions, archival accounts, and extensive archaeological research, James Brooks unravels the story and its significance. Mesa of Sorrows follows the pattern of an archaeological expedition, uncovering layer after layer of evidence and theories. Brooks questions their reliability and shows how interpretations were shaped by academic, religious and tribal politics. Piecing together three centuries of investigation, he offers insight into why some were spared&#8212;women, mostly, and taken captive&#8212;and others sacrificed. He weighs theories that the attack was in retribution for Awat&#8217;ovi having welcomed Franciscan missionaries or for the residents&#8217; practice of sorcery, and argues that a perfect storm of internal and external crises revitalized an ancient cycle of ritual bloodshed and purification.<br />
A haunting account of a shocking massacre, Mesa of Sorrows is a probing exploration of how societies confront painful histories, and why communal violence still plagues us today.<br />
A French edition of of the book, Awat&#8217;ovi : l&#8217;histoire et les fantomes du passe en pays Hopi, is forthcoming.<br />

Driven Toward Madness tells the story of how fugitive slave Margaret Garner and her family escaped to free Ohio in late January 1856, only to be captured in a cabin outside of Cincinnati. What happened as the Garner family were being apprehended is the climax of the story; Taylor shows what drove Margaret&#8217;s attempt to kill all four of her children, while only successfully doing so by way of decapitating her two year-old daughter Mary.<br />
Based in history, Taylor uses various theoretical frameworks like trauma studies, pain studies, black feminist theory, and literary criticism to broaden our understandings of the why surrounding Margaret Garner&#8217;s murder of her child. Taylor broadens popular understandings of black womanhood, resistance, and what are acceptable forms of gendered violence. In doing so, Taylor displays the ways antagonistic groups like abolitionists and pro-slavery activists both used Garner&#8217;s story for their own causes without necessarily recognizing Garner&#8217;s agency and humanity. Ultimately, Taylor expresses how far a person could go to protect their child from bondage, even if that meant taking their life so they reached freedom elsewhere.<br />
Author <a href="http://coas.howard.edu/history/faculty_Taylor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikki M. Taylor</a> is Professor of History and History Department Chair at Howard University. Her work focuses on nineteenth-century African American History. Her sub-specialties are in Urban, African American Women, and Intellectual History.<br />

Beston links together the long string of American heavyweight champions from the late 19th century until the 1990s, touching on the big names of John L Sullivan, Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and the lesser known champions in between. We talk about what each figure meant in the time periods that they lived in, explore why Americans dominated the global sport for so long, and try to answer why the heavyweight belt has shifted so rapidly away from the United States over the last decades. Beston weaves the tales of each fighter&#8217;s life together to create a larger tapestry of the evolution of boxing over the late 19th and 20th centuries, which gives an insight to boxing&#8217;s cultural significance in American history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Rapidly changing politics. Debates over the meaning of immigration. Widespread violence against minority groups. An economy undergoing a radical shift in form. The thirty years after the end of the Civil War have much in common with the United States in the second decade of the twenty first century, argues Stanford historian <a href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/richard-white" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard White</a> in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QstTFa-Jxk2tOTuOtjIUXvIAAAFgCdJSfgEAAAFKAbm13Bk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199735816/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0199735816&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=eJfrzdWA4eStluANuNrHNQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Republic for Which it Stands: The United States during Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896</a> (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-republic-for-which-it-stands-9780199735815?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2017). In this ninth volume of the long-running <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-history-of-the-united-states-ohus/?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford History of the United States</a> series, White tells the story of a period in American history too long thought of as historical &#8220;flyover country.&#8221; Rather than merely an era of institutional failures and mediocre presidents, the Reconstruction Era and Gilded Age are critical to understanding the politics and society of the modern United States (though there were still plenty of failures and uninspiring politicians along the way). Americans often used the image of the home, ubiquitous though often hiding in plain sight, to argue about free labor, racial equality, and environmental crises. In The Republic for Which it Stands, White makes a strong case for a wholesale reevaluation of the long period after the Civil War as more than just decades of missed opportunity; Americans spent those years fundamentally reshaping the republic itself.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1976, the landmark supreme court case Estelle v. Gamble, established that under the Eighth Amendment &#8220;deliberate indifference&#8221; to the health needs of incarcerated individuals was tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. Now, jails and prisons are one of the rare places in the contemporary U.S. where healthcare is deemed a right and not a privilege. In her new ethnography <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QobRWvs4ucHMNl8QC59rseQAAAFgCeurQgEAAAFKAbsjAE4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520288688/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520288688&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=v88vjBalBU2hI8nmQ9MGFg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jailcare: Finding the Safety Net for Women behind Bars </a>(<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520288683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California Press</a>, 2017), physician and Anthropologist, <a href="https://www.jailcare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carolyn Sufrin</a>, examines what this means for incarcerated women when health care, coercion and violence coalesce. In addition to describing in detail how women experience healthcare and motherhood in custody, she offers us devastating diagnoses of how broken our current health and social safety nets are that women come to desire the cruel relative safety of jail.<br />
My conversation with Dr. Sufrin just begins to tackle the rich, beautiful and devastatingly complex lives of the women she encountered and cared for as both a clinician and social scientist. While an academic monograph, this book is accessible to scholars, activists and concerned citizens alike.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[From the export of the Chicago Police Department&#8217;s interrogation experts to Iraq after 2003, to casual references of the US-Indian Wars by US soldiers in Vietnam, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QveBeJ1HX7c5htnH9rTVRGQAAAFgDdpEAQEAAAFKAXvmG6c/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520296257/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520296257&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=MJMv4.xHYlKPqZS-r8qXwg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Race and America&#8217;s Long War</a> (<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520296251" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California Press</a>, 2017) highlights how the policies and cultural norms of war have become deeply intertwined with, and often dependent on, the architecture of racial difference inside and outside the United States. Blurring the lines between domestic and international affairs, configurations of war represent subtle and direct continuities of US imperialism, colonialism, and structural racism, sometimes across centuries and other times within the same Presidential administration.<br />
This book is a collection of essays by Nikhil Pal Singh in which he traces the racialized narratives of security in the United States from the settler colonial wars to acquire Indigenous land, through several centuries of slavery and the period of Reconstruction that followed, through the Civil Rights era and Black Freedom struggles to the Vietnam and Iraq Wars among many other periods and movements, and finally in the context of the more amorphous Wars on Drugs and Terror.<br />
Singh draws out one of the core paradoxes of contemporary liberalism, long posited as a remedy to perpetual war, in highlighting that while, &#8220;racial exclusion and inclusion have arisen in tandem, so have colorblindness and multiculturalism.&#8221; Published in a year of political transition often depicted as a grave departure from the country&#8217;s structural and moral past, Singh alternatively frames the current political crisis in terms of five hundred years of continuous inner- and outer-wars, suggesting alternatively that this political transition is a period to confront the long held norms of public life that produced it.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qk6WYqciU6xQEU1JOQYM-SgAAAFf7zqPJQEAAAFKAefd2us/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0826521150/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0826521150&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=KcQXbtjBnENUBUS0V7K2lg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caring for Red: A Daughter&#8217;s Memoir</a> (<a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/university-press/book/9780826521156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanderbilt University Press</a>, 2016), <a href="http://www.mindyfried.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindy Fried </a>shares her experiences with providing care for her father at the end of his life. With rich stories and memories of her father, the book introduces the reader to Manny &#8220;Red&#8221; Fried, in addition to Mindy as a daughter as caregiver. The book really focuses on how families can preserve the dignity of older family members as they age, as well as how we can keep older family members active and engaged into their later years. Red&#8217;s personal history is important throughout the book&#8212;he was a labor organizer and once pursued by the government during the McCarthy era. This historical time influences not only Red&#8217;s life and experiences but also that of his family. By combining &#8220;activism with acting,&#8221; he led a rich life and was interested in being engaged until the end. With friends and family having &#8220;Mondays with Manny,&#8221; his community was able to provide support and continue to keep his tie to the theatre community. In this book, Fried also provides important insights into her role as a caregiving adult child, a common role for many Americans as their parents age. Fried takes a wide view of her father&#8217;s care and provides insights and stories into the assisted living facility in which he lived, as well as the role of a hired caregiver in their lives. Although this book is labeled a memoir, Fried is a sociologist and ties in many important ideas and theories into the book, including activity theory and continuity theory.<br />
This book will be of interest to sociologists in general, but especially those in the area of aging and family caregiving. In addition, adult children currently providing care for a parent may find the book insightful and interesting, along with practitioners in the caregiving sector. The use of theory and a sociological lens throughout the book makes it accessible in many ways, and would be good for a graduate level Sociology class on Aging or Death and Dying.<br />

Smith</a>, Assistant Professor of Art History at Michigan State University, unravels the compelling life story of Kiowa photographer Horace Poolaw (1906-84), one of the first professional Native American photographers. Born on the Kiowa reservation in Anadarko, Oklahoma, Poolaw bought his first camera at the age of fifteen and began taking photos of family, friends, and noted leaders in the Kiowa community, also capturing successive years of powwows and pageants at various fairs, expositions, and other events. Though Poolaw earned some income as a professional photographer, he farmed, raised livestock, and took other jobs to help fund his passion for documenting his community. Smith examines the cultural and artistic significance of Poolaw&#8217;s life in professional photography from 1925 to 1945 in light of European and modernist discourses on photography, portraiture, the function of art, Native American identity, and American Indian religious and political activism. Rather than through the lens of Native people&#8217;s inevitable extinction or within a discourse of artistic modernism, Smith evaluates Poolaw&#8217;s photography within art history and Native American history, simultaneously questioning the category of fine artist in relation to the creative lives of Native peoples.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The immigrant son of Hungarian Jews, Fox got his start in the entertainment industry in 1904 as an exhibitor. Enjoying success but chafing under the restrictive terms of film distributors, in 1915 he expanded into production, creating the Fox Film Corporation. As Krefft explains, Fox favored a director-centric approach to film making, working with such legendary figures as John Ford and F. W. Murnau to produce some of the greatest films of the silent era. By the late 1920s he had built a vast entertainment empire, only to lose first his fortune and then his company in the economic collapse at the end of the decade, which left him to watch as others turned his studio into 20th Century Fox, one of the big six studios in Hollywood today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

New England has long presented an idealized sense of its past. Restored colonial homes, antique shops, white picket fences around town greens&#8212;these are some features you may associate with a conservative, even blinkered view of the past. But the reality is otherwise. Lockwood shows how the story behind this burst of regionalist pride, much the product of the late nineteenth century, is queerer and more women-centered than you could possibly have imagined. In her book, Lockwood argues that nineteenth-century women writers, photographers, and colonial revivalists presented the queer, unmarried daughter of New England as a figure crucial to remembering and producing US history, crucial to that history itself. These women include Sarah Orne Jewett, Alice Morse Earle, C. Alice Baker, as well as Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Pauline Elizabeth Hopkins, and many more. Their literary work, history writing, china collecting, and home restoration evinced a deep cosmopolitanism far exceeding the limits of any supposed provincialism of the New England spinster, both in their own time and in the past about which they wrote.<br />
We talk about how the late-nineteenth century New England regionalists aligned themselves with colonial forms of dissent against monarchical rule, but also rule by men. They followed the trails of colonial women who once manned garrisons in times of war, as well as women who, after capture, chose to stay living with Indians. Much of our conversation talks about how the later women regionalists found roots in the past for their own forms of living intimately with women in the present, including in romantic relationships. A large part of our discussion also focuses on how the knowledge they produced of that past was largely found through the use of their bodies as historical instruments in the care of objects and spaces of a home, the tending of gardens, the wearing of colonial dress. Their bodily sensorium revealed similarities of experiences across time, including feelings of intense sexual pleasure as well as gender-based oppression. Ultimately, this work attuned people to how affective ties and material forms of everyday life (which include nature, objects, the space of a town and its buildings) structure each other in dynamic relationship. The preservation of historic homes and other open to the public and welcoming visitors today owes much to these women. Throughout our conversation, Lockwood and I continue to return to the fact that new possibilities for the ongoing American democratic experiment were to be found in the past as much as the present. The same is true today&#8212;if you learn to open your senses to the world around you.<br />

As he explains, consolidation was a trend throughout America during this era. Big business was at the forefront of this, as Wall Street provided the financing necessary for numerous industries to form dominant corporate combinations through mergers and takeovers. The enormous wealth controlled by these titans was prominent throughout the city, both in the new skyscrapers rising to dominate the city&#8217;s skyline and in the cultural and educational institutions that flourished with infusions of their capital. Similar mergers took place in many sectors and aspects of city life, from entertainment to labor, with even the criminal underworld consolidating in a reflection of the times. Wallace&#8217;s book chronicles all of this, as well as the developments in the many communities of a richly diverse city that during these years experienced dramatic growth and changes wrought by a global war.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In short, violence on the job has a history. The shift from violence committed by management against striking workers to individualized violence in the form of shootings and assaults among workers occurred as labor unions lost power and splintered into radical and more mainstream factions. By examining the often hyper-masculine heyday of the mid-twentieth-century auto industry, Milloy makes a strong case for a broader definition of what constitutes violence at work under capitalism. In the words of one attorney reflecting on a workplace shooting in a Detroit Chrysler factory, &#8220;Chrysler pulled the trigger.&#8221; The structure of auto manufacturing work itself bred a culture of violence on the factory floor. In both Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, race, gender, and labor dynamics mediated the relationships between employees in the sprawling auto factories that straddled the Canadian-American border. Blood, Sweat, and Fear tells the stark story of life and death within those plants as the nature of work and labor changed in the late twentieth century.<br />
Jeremy Milloy earned his PhD at Simon Fraser University and is a SSHRC postdoctoral fellow at Trent University.<br />

And does that group define themselves that way as well? <a href="http://www.nedamaghbouleh.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neda Maghbouleh</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QoMMHCZEkgaeNDTfqF9zLSUAAAFf0WtVQgEAAAFKAYvoH7Q/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1503603377/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1503603377&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=o3y6rNrGWrymTBnCfsrI8g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Limits of Whiteness: Iranian Americans and the Everyday Politics of Race </a>(<a href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=24756" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanford University Press</a>, 2017), uses interview and ethnographic data to better understand how Iranian Americans perceive themselves and are perceived. &#8220;Caught in the chasm between formal ethno-racial invisibility and informal hypervisibility,&#8221; Iranian Americans often straddle a space in which they are sometimes defined as white but other times not. Through the voices and experiences of 80 young people, Maghbouleh exposes the reader to the inner workings of their lives at school, at home, and abroad. By comparing and contrasting experiences in different social systems and situations, the reader becomes immersed in the lives of these youth and is connected to their racialized experiences. At home, these youth are often told that they are white and that they should be proud of their heritage; however, the youth know these stories would not be understood or accepted by peers. At school, the youth are quite often &#8220;browned&#8221; and bullied by peers and others outside their homes. Maghbouleh also examines the interesting scenario of the &#8220;flip side&#8221; when the youth travel to Iran, elaborating on their experiences there where they sometimes feel too &#8220;American.&#8221;<br />
This book does a stellar job of grounding findings within the stories of those interviewed. Additionally, it builds up the historical background for the reader, using important legal cases, in which the whiteness of Iranians and other groups are tried, to set the stage for present day experiences of Iranian Americans. Overall, this book presents a solid overview and understanding of the ways in which Iranian American youth experience race in America. This book is rich with information and stories, but completely accessible to the lay reader or even scholars who do not study race. This book would be good for upper level undergraduate Sociology classes and the perfect addition to a graduate level Sociology of Race class.<br />

Her book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qg4GzXxvKcIGB91jaepWn6sAAAFf0XNpTQEAAAFKAX4nrkc/http://www.amazon.com/dp/022648209X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=022648209X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=VIMy0JGCNq4PW63pcKedIA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consuming Religion</a> (<a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo26691939.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Chicago Press</a>, 2017) offers a collection of eleven essays of cultural critique that reflect on the connections between religion, consumer culture, celebrity and the corporation. Her definition of religion is capacious and founded on Durkheim&#8217;s understanding of it as a form of social organization that determines who we are. In contemporary culture religion is an attempt to mass-produce relations of value and generate both control and freedom. Applying this definition to popular culture, she examines binge watching, the cubicle of the Action Office of Herman Miller, Purity Balls, Hotel Preston&#8217;s innovation in the Spiritual Menu offerings, and the fascination with the Kardashians. In an ethnographic study of the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs, she demonstrates how the idea of corporate culture becomes a form of religion. Lofton challenges us to see religion everywhere in our construction of meaning and values.<br />

In an auditorium in Belcourt, North Dakota, on a chilly October day in 1932, Robert Bruce and his fellow tribal citizens held the political fate of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in their hands. Bruce, and the others, had been asked to adopt a tribal constitution, but he was unhappy with the document, as it limited tribal governmental authority. However, white authorities told the tribal nation that the proposed constitution was a necessary step in bringing a lawsuit against the federal government over a long-standing land dispute. Bruce&#8217;s choice, and the choice of his fellow citizens, has shaped tribal governance on the reservation ever since that fateful day. By asking why the citizens of Turtle Mountain voted to adopt the document despite perceived flaws, he confronts assumptions about how tribal constitutions came to be, reexamines the status of tribal governments in the present, and offers a fresh set of questions as we look to the future of governance in Native America and beyond.<br />

In his second book, Criblez tells the story of the most maligned decade of professional basketball the 1970s. Tall Tales and Short Shorts takes the reader from the retirement of Bill Russell in 1969, which ended the great dynasty of the Boston Celtics, to the emergence of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the late 1970s. During the 1970s, professional basketball dealt with expansion, the merger of the National Basketball Association and the American Basketball Association, illicit drug use, violence on the court and rising player salaries. The 1970s were a turbulent period in American history, as the Vietnam War ended ingloriously, Richard Nixon&#8217;s presidency was destroyed by the Watergate scandal, and the price of gasoline soared while public confidence waned. Basketball in the 1970s would be defined by stars such as Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Pete Maravich and Rick Barry; Criblez shines new light on the &#8220;Dark Ages&#8221; of the NBA, blending pro basketball with popular culture.<br />

Americans are fixated on freedom and saturated in religion but define the concepts in various ways. The production of religious freedom is only possible within this context of malleability, contestation, and disagreement. Curtis demonstrates this process through a number of related examples, including conflicting visions of Christianity, tensions between social dependence and independence, economic issues, questions of racial inclusion, and corporate rights. Through these cases we see how people respond when freedom makes them uncomfortable. Inequality was at the center of American history and the regular rearticulation of individual liberation from social constraints begins to plot the historical boundaries of religious freedom. In our conversation we discuss minister Charles Grandison Finney, author Louisa May Alcott, politician William Jennings Bryan, filmmaker D.W. Griffith, Catholic Governor of New York Al Smith, Malcolm X, arguments for Intelligent Design, and the exercise of religious liberty in the case of Hobby Lobby.<br />

Hinnershitz takes a thematic focus across the long 20th century to show how Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, and South Asians contested discrimination in land ownership, education, sexual relations and marriage, and business entrepreneurship. From &#8220;self-Orientalizing&#8221; as non-colored people to invoking their privileges as foreign nationals or refugees, the strategies and arguments that Asian Americans employed in the long and uneven struggle for equality were as varied as they were creative. Hinnershitz uses a wide-ranging source base including legal opinions, newspapers, and oral histories to narrate heartbreaking losses as well as surprising victories, such as the injunction against Klan violence that Vietnamese fishermen won in Texas in 1981. A Different Shade of Justice will interest readers of 20th-century US history, legal history, southern history, and Asian American history.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There may not be a more ubiquitous presence on American highways than the truck. The images are iconic: eighteen-wheelers with muddy steel and chrome, and a driver in aviator sunglasses and a mesh hat. But as <a href="https://www.steveviscelli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Viscelli</a>, political sociologist and lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, shows in his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QsF_U8zkHT0IBNEGImgs4_gAAAFfpuvFNwEAAAFKAS47Tzo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520278127/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520278127&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=iFivyRc7uGpHc3Yqzry0PA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream</a> (<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520278127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California Press</a>, 2016), the romantic idea of the hardworking, solitary truck driver making a decent, honest living for his family must be laid to rest. Once among the best blue-collar jobs in the country with one of the strongest labor unions, the deregulation and subsequent greedy practices of the trucking industry turned it into a &#8220;bad&#8221; one, with very low pay, very long and unpredictable hours, and awful work conditions. Aware of these realities, the trucking industry does a masterful job of creating and maintaining the illusion that being a truck driver is still a path toward upward mobility, an honest and true working-class version of the American Dream. They structure work so that workers play a &#8220;miles game&#8221; of always trying to maximize time for a little extra pay, and push the allure of becoming an independent contractor, which only indebts them to their company. Becoming a trucker himself, Viscelli vividly shows his own frustrations in training and out on the road, caught up in the game and hearing stories of workers who haven&#8217;t seen their families in weeks and are still struggling to make ends meet. Through an illuminating case, Viscelli addresses the timeless questions: &#8220;Why do people work bad jobs?&#8221; and &#8220;Why do they stay in them for as long as they do?&#8221; His answers get at the heart not just of a single occupation and industry, but also of work in today&#8217;s economy.<br />

After the introduction of cattle into each of these societies by Europeans, not only did the cows bring ecological change, but they fundamentally altered how people lived, worked, earned their living and interacted with the world at large. As California&#8217;s and Hawai&#8217;i&#8217;s economies became increasingly focused on cattle, especially the hide and tallow industries in the 1820s and 30s, the changes both in the land and the people who worked it paved the way for broader colonial projects both by European countries and eventually the United States.<br />

Two of her previous books include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Civil-War-Sisterhood-Commission-Transition/dp/1555536581" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil War Sisterhood: The United States Sanitary Commission and Women&#8217;s Politics in Transition (2000)</a>, which is about the understudied roles of women in relief efforts during the war, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Army-Home-Women-Northern-America/dp/0807872636" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Army at Home&#8221;: Women and the Civil War on the Northern Home Front (2009)</a>, which concerns the experiences of working class women in the north. She is also the principal editor of Emilie Davis&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Emilie-Daviss-Civil-War-Philadelphia/dp/0271063688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civil War: The Diaries of a Free Black Woman in Philadelphia (2014).</a><br />
Her latest book, and the subject of our discussion, is<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QmPLNUaO44LjZSfEkPHlIasAAAFfnM43rQEAAAFKAZne7AY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/146963127X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=146963127X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=tyBhvFoTbPi9gX-ahFx8tg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Sex and the Civil War: Soldiers, Pornography, and the Making of an American Morality</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469631271/sex-and-the-civil-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2017). Giesberg argues that the Civil War is the turning point for the influential rise of postwar anti-pornography laws and a genesis for the related network of anti-vice campaigns, which included laws against contraceptives and abortion, newly entrenched legal regulations of marriage, and ever broader social purity initiatives around sexuality.<br />
We discuss how crucial, and yet understudied, questions of sex and desire are to the Civil War era and how silence around them has affected the ways we talk about and regulate social relations today. Much of our conversation focuses on how a small group of men created new regulations around pornography, the constitution of which was always up for debate, to hold onto the political and social power that they felt to be threatened by men of a lower class or of a different race. Prominent among this group of regulators, and a leading face of the postwar anti-vice campaigns, was Anthony Comstock. After serving in a largely inactive regiment during the war, and feeling left out of the camaraderie generated by the sharing of pornography among his fellow soldiers, Comstock fashioned for himself a largely illusory legal fraternity of moral crusaders. For pornography was hardly the main issue for those who associated themselves with his cause. Geisberg writes and talks about how other men in power negotiated the place of newly freed slaves by tightening the regulatory role that marriage played in their &#8220;free&#8221; lives. Doctors jumped at the opportunity to regulate abortion and contraception as a way to further professionalize themselves after postwar advances in medicine. Both of these groups became part of an omnibus of social reform that affects the country to this day. As you will hear over the course of our conversation, the importance of Giesberg&#8217;s account is in showing the connections between these issues and how they come together in the Civil War. Sexual abuse was at the center of social systems, including slavery. But the legal articulations of sexual crimes after the war created more easily regulated vices that distracted attention aw...]]></itunes:summary>

This was a momentous period for Roosevelt, as he participated in two summits and several other meetings with his allies to dictate the course of the war and the peace that would follow. Yet while noting both Roosevelt&#8217;s deteriorating health and the stress the grueling itinerary imposed on him physically (which was not helped by the travel accommodations of the time), Lelyveld views the claims afterward that his medical problems inhibited his contribution as more often the product of retrospective accounts than reliable contemporary assessments. It was Roosevelt&#8217;s desire to finish the task of shaping the postwar peace that led him to run for a final term, even though many of his closest aides believed that the president was unlikely to finish it if he won. This made Roosevelt&#8217;s health the great unspoken issue of the election, one that determined the selection of Harry Truman as his running mate and defined how the president conducted his last campaign for office.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Rindge</a>, Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Gonzaga University, explores critiques of this vision of contemporary America in popular cinema. Through a close investigation of the films Fight Club (1999), American Beauty (1999), and About Schmidt (2002) Rindge dissects constructions of the relationship between national success and the accompanying denial of death. Myth has long been a central motif in the study of religion so he frames film as parables that dismantle orthodox myths. Putting these films in conversation with biblical texts Rindge demonstrates how cinema can be situated as both myth-maker and myth deconstruction. In our conversation we discussed the prosperity gospel of American nationalism, creating a meaningful life, the denial of human fragility, biblical laments, and the field of religion and film.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Through meticulous archival research, close readings of key works, and informed and imaginative speculation about a largely enigmatic life, Red Ink author <a href="https://sites.wp.odu.edu/englishphd/community/faculty/drew-lopenzina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drew Lopenzina</a> provides a vivid portrait of a singular Native American figure in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QqXtFP2adZkhGLkQYxzXTn4AAAFfnUiJygEAAAFKAccvhQo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1625342594/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1625342594&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=BYNhP-173fa-WEtEynTW8w&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Through an Indian&#8217;s Looking-Glass: A Cultural Biography of William Apess, Pequot </a>(<a href="http://www.umass.edu/umpress/title/through-indians-looking-glass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Massachusetts Press</a>, 2017).<br />
This &#8220;cultural biography&#8221; provides a lens through which to comprehend the complex dynamics of indigenous survival and resistance in the era of America&#8217;s early nationhood. William Apess&#8217;s life intersects with multiple aspects of indigenous identity and existence in this period, including indentured servitude, slavery, service in the armed forces, syncretic engagements with Methodist spirituality, and Native struggles for political and cultural autonomy. Even more, Apess offers a powerful and provocative voice for the persistence of Native American presence in a time and place that was long supposed to have settled its Indian question in favor of extinction. This new biography will sit alongside Apess&#8217;s own writing as vital reading for those interested in early America and indigeneity.<br />

Vanished in Hiawatha further connects the establishment of the Canton Asylum with efforts to assimilate Indigenous populations during the first three decades of the twentieth century, and considers how and why the institution remained open for three decades, given the ongoing mismanagement and mistreatment of Native patients at the facility.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://us.macmillan.com/author/rebeccafraser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebecca Fraser</a> is a writer, journalist, and broadcaster whose work has been published in Tatler, Vogue, The Times, and The Spectator. President of the Bronte Society for many years, she is the author of a biography of Charlotte Bronte that examines her life in the context of contemporary attitudes about women. Her last book was The Story of Britain, a single-volume history of how England was governed over the past 2000 years. Now, just in time for Thanksgiving, comes her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qh76MDVS2rawAXShqgVGYHEAAAFfeQut-AEAAAFKAZzzy68/http://www.amazon.com/dp/125010856X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=125010856X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=FCJQUqoM2ix1Q6yr2M3drA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Mayflower: The Families, the Voyage, and the Founding of America</a> (St. Martin&#8217;s Press 2017). It tells the story of the Plymouth colony by focusing on the adventures and trials of Edward Winslow, who sailed over on the Mayflower in 1620, and then his son Josiah, who played a crucial role in the growing wars with the American Indians in the late 1670s.<br />
Over the course of the hour, we talk about how Edward, a largely ignored protagonist of America&#8217;s founding story, was foundational to maintaining early relationships with the Indians (including for the exchange of food for the &#8216;first&#8217; Thanksgiving). Fraser talks about how Edward&#8217;s ideal of community, and Plymouth&#8217;s more &#8216;tolerant&#8217; society compared to the Massachusetts Bay Colony to its north, was troubled by the influx of new colonists, the consolidation of colonial governance in the region, patriarchal power grabs, and the re-entrenchment of religious orthodoxies. Both in our discussion and in the book&#8212;a dramatic, highly detailed narrative of promise and nightmarish turns&#8212;Fraser adds much nuance to the emotional, psychological, and material complexities of the early colonists conflicted lives. We dive into Edward&#8217;s interest in and writing of ethnographical accounts, particularly of the Indians, as well as the place of women in the Plymouth story. Fraser reveals the wry perspectives women take on the men in their lives as we come to feel the effects of deaths, fluctuating fortunes, the formations of new churches, and the dangers of giving birth on the structure of life. The particularly adventurous energy, and personality, of Edward Winslow, and his less curious son&#8217;s re-assertion of an English identity, are the engines of the story. Their paths afford a new view of both the intercultural relationships and negotiations that kept the nascent country alive, and their eventual dismissal by the next generation. The result is a war with the Indians that would forever change the story.<br />

Following up on recent podcasts with <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/daniel-bennett-defending-faith-the-politics-of-the-christian-conservative-legal-movement-u-press-of-kansas-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Bennett</a> and <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/christopher-baylor-first-to-the-party-the-group-origins-of-political-transformations-penn-press-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Baylor</a>, The Rights Turn demonstrates a transformation of American politics with the waning of Christian America. As opposed to conservatives focusing on morality and liberals on rights, both sides now emphasize rights-based arguments to win policy battles and build support. Based on historical and quantitative data, Lewis analyzes evangelical advocacy and public opinion related to abortion, free speech, and the death penalty. He shows how rights claims have been used to protect evangelicals, whose cultural positions are increasingly in the minority.<br />

In this podcast, we discuss how poets, such as Frank O&#8217;Hara, Ted Berrigan, and Anne Waldman, affected the writing and careers of Lou Reed, Patti Smith, and Richard Hell. We also explore how punk rock, in turn, shaped the work of Elaine Myles and Dennis Cooper. Kane&#8217;s work helps re-map the relationships between poetry and punk rock.<br />

Bateson trained in the natural sciences and anthropology, moved to the field of psychiatry and conceptualized the double bind theory of schizophrenia. Leading a research group of scientists and captivated by the possibilities the double bind theory offered in understanding the anxiety of the age, he sought to connect it with other intellectual currents such cybernetics, game theory, evolutionary and communication theory. Working across disciplines, he addressed the modern problem of the distinctions between fact/value, reason/emotion, nature/culture, producing an inescapable double bind for society. Plunging into the paradox of the human condition, he challenged the instrumental view of solving social problems, breaking new ground against binary thinking and in addressing the ecological crisis as a system in runaway. Without appealing to metaphysics, he articulated a holistic theory of mind as a new foundation for thinking about humanity and its relationship to the natural world. Chaney has provided a rich exploration of a fascinating thinker who set the foundations for the information age.<br />

Using cultural icons such as Lester Young, Humphrey Bogart, Albert Camus, Billie Holiday, Jack Kerouac, Marlon Brando, Miles Davis, and Lorraine Hansberry to name a few, Dinerstein weaves an image of cool in the 1940s and 1950s as it intersects jazz, film noir, literature, and existentialism. Well researched and compellingly written, The Origins of Cool in Postwar America examines the ways in which popular culture works to define cool throughout the Cold War. Dinerstein&#8217;s work interrogates cool, presenting the way in which individuals show how cool is a way of rebellion and resistance against racism or other cultural and social norms. Cool brings a hope to individuals during cultural shifts that Dinerstein presents in this thorough and thoughtful exploration into cool and the icons who exuded the term.<br />

Scott estimates that he&#8217;s told more than 15,000 stories and interviewed 30,000 people for print, radio and television. He describes himself as a journalist who has &#8220;tried to stick to old-fashioned reporting, just the facts, without adding my personal views.&#8221; He also writes that &#8220;at the heart of every story, big and small, is a person. It is people who make the news.&#8221; The winner of 11 Emmy Awards, Scott is currently the senior correspondent at New York&#8217;s WPIX-TV. He has written for the New York Herald Tribune as well as Parade Magazine and has worked as a radio reporter for the Mutual Broadcasting System and at such television outfits as CNN, WNEW, and WABC.<br />
In this New Books Network interview, Marvin Scott recounts some of the stories he covered including one he did on Charlie Walsh, the bank thief who became a New York celebrity. He also describes how he managed to interview Abraham Zapruder and how many years later, he synced Zapruder&#8217;s recorded words to the 26-second amateur film he had shot of the Kennedy assassination in Dallas.<br />
Scott champions traditional, shoe-leather reporting and laments the influence of social media outlets that publish first and check the facts later.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.americanhistoryworkshop.com/richard-extended-bio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Rabinowitz</a> is one of the leading public historians in the United States. He has helped conceptualize, design, organize, and build over 500 history programs across the U.S. at such sites as the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in New York; the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute; and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. Between 2004 and 2011, Richard curated six blockbuster history exhibitions at the New-York Historical Society, including Slavery in New York and Revolution! The Atlantic World Reborn. He also drew up the interpretive and curatorial plan for the Slavery and Freedom exhibition at the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Most of this work has come out of his founding and directing the <a href="http://www.americanhistoryworkshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American History Workshop</a>.<br />
The journey he has taken&#8212;from receiving his PhD in the History of American Civilization at Harvard to becoming a public historian and working on these exhibits&#8212;is the subject of his recent book: <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qk0spt7KxhVeyG4oHHrFSNQAAAFfWXKxEAEAAAFKAdXGxBA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/146962950X/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=146962950X&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Yg5qEEC3yMr0jOBGdqQQQw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curating America: Journeys through Storyscapes of the American Past</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469629506/curating-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016). Over the course of the hour, I talk with Richard about the changing ways people have come to engage with the past and how this has impacted, and been shaped by, his many museum projects and exhibitions. Richard focuses on the materiality of lived experience. From it he culls knowledge of big ideas (such as freedom, revolution, and oppression) and uses places, objects, and the bodily sensorium to create &#8220;storyscapes&#8221; in which audiences can recognize themselves. Crucial to this process is the knowledge that audiences and museum-goers bring with them. Richard speaks to how he has, together with these stakeholders, generated a new historical awareness that is more reflective of our ever-changing present.<br />

Baylor is an American Political Science Association Congressional Fellow. Based on substantial archival research, Baylor&#8217;s book positions interest groups at the center of what makes parties change. Using the case of civil rights organizations and the Democratic Party in the 1940s and cultural conservative organizations and the Republican Party in the 1980s and 90s, First to the Party shows how groups gain influence within existing political parties and foment transformation. He argues that parties respond less to public opinion and voters than to powerful groups, especially during the nomination process. Baylor deepens what we know about political parties, interest groups, and their interactions.<br />

First noticed by colonists in 1680, by the nineteenth century Massachusetts&#8217; Dighton Rock was one of the most famous and contested artifacts of American antiquity. This forty-two ton boulder covered in petroglyphs has been the subject of endless speculation denying its Native American origins. Interpretations have included Vikings, Phoenicians, Egyptians, Lost Tribes of Israel, visitors from Atlantis, ancient Freemasons, and (today) the lost Portuguese explorer, Miguel Corte-Real. Hunter dissects almost four centuries of Dighton Rock&#8217;s misinterpretations to reveal its larger role in the colonization and the conceptualization of Native Americans. This sprawling study brings a fresh perspective to scientific racism, the rise of American archaeology and anthropology, the intellectual weaponry of colonialism, and the construction of migration theories for the peopling of the Americas. By disenfranchising Native Americans from their own past in interpretations of Dighton Rock and related archaeological puzzles such as the Mound Builders, colonizers have sought to answer to their own advantage two fundamental questions: to whom does America belong, and who belongs in America?<br />

The book is rich with detail and one of the few histories to put the vast corpus of Hawaiian language sources to use in understanding the island&#8217;s past. John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s life also serves as a rewarding vantage point for thinking about Hawaiian religion during the early years of the Kingdom of Hawai&#8217;i, and the expanding influence of Christianity. In our conversation we discussed genres of life writing, challenges of reframing Hawaiian modes of thinking into western academic categories, Christian conversion, John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s s upbringing, the importance of family genealogy, the Laplace affair, King Kamehameha and his descendants, Hawaiian language sources, elder years and productive retirement, and John Papa I&#8217;i&#8217;s importance for Hawaiians today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The meaning assigned to architecture is complex and varied. Urban architecture is often stripped of meaning when people abandon the neighborhoods or are absent of meaning at the time of their inception. This leaves the people who inhabit the terrain to assign their own meaning to the architecture.

In our interview, we discuss how this study was shaped from his past observations of message carriers, as well as topics such as the impact that history has on the development of parkour in nations around the world, the perception that traceurs have on hyper-masculine males who are viewed as dangerous when performing parkour, and the difference between risk-taking behavior and thrill-seeking behavior. We also learn about his thoughts on the current environment of risk-taking in lifestyle sports and how these sports are different from competitive (or team) sports.<br />

Cooper</a> describes how Adams held fast to the values of that generation during a time of dramatic political change. Though aspiring to a career in politics from an early age, Adams sought to win office mainly through merit. Thanks to his ability and experience he served in a series of diplomatic and political postings, culminating in his selection by President James Monroe as Secretary of State in 1817. While Adams succeeded Monroe as president in 1825, the controversy surrounding his election thwarted his ambitious agenda and crystalized the development of a new party alignment that contributed to his defeat four years later. Yet Adams&#8217;s return to public office with his election to the House gave him an opportunity to play a continuing role on the national scene, particularly as the country&#8217;s leaders grappled with the increasingly problematic issues of slavery and territorial expansion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

It&#8217;s about how, in the 1930s and 40s, a group of reformers in the US and in Mexico undertook projects to transform the rural worlds of their respective countries in the name of social justice and agrarian productivity. Olsson demonstrates how closely the histories of Mexico and the American South in particular paralleled one another, and how parallel histories yielded parallel problems, including mass rural poverty, landlessness, and economic deprivation. Whether in Mississippi or Michoacan, Tennessee or Tabasco, the rural masses saw few tangible benefits in the economic miracle heralded by boosters in Atlanta and Mexico City, Professor Olsson writes. And so in that decade historians sometimes like to call the long 1930s, Mexican and US reformers crossed the border again and again, to share models and ideas, and to undertake projects of rural revitalization through varying methods and with varying results. Olsson&#8217;s book recovers a world in which like-minded Mexicans and Americans worked together, toward what they hoped would be a more just world, in concert and in solidarity. Tore C. Olsson is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Slavery as a system of torture and bondage has fascinated the optical imagination of the transatlantic world for centuries. Scholars have examined various aspects of the visual culture that was slavery, including its painting, sculpture, pamphlet campaigns, and artwork, yet an important piece of this visual culture has gone unexamined: the popular and frequently reprinted antislavery illustrated books that were utilized extensively by the antislavery movement in the first half of the nineteenth century.<br />
<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiH_jXVHW2x_8cQlkembr6oAAAFfMBajUwEAAAFKAYDF4es/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0820351164/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0820351164&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=kahh-xyw2JIYIzhyT3ZaEQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Illustrated Slave: Empathy, Graphic Narrative, and the Visual Culture of the Transatlantic Abolition Movement, 1800-1852</a> (<a href="http://www.ugapress.org/index.php/books/illustrated_slave/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Georgia Press</a>, 2017) analyzes some of the more innovative works in the archive of antislavery illustrated books published from 1800 to 1852 alongside other visual materials that depict enslavement. The author argues that some illustrated narratives attempt to shift a viewing reader away from pity and spectatorship into a mode of empathy and interrelationship with the enslaved. She also contends that some illustrated books characterize the enslaved as obtaining a degree of control over narrative and lived experiences, even if these figurations entail a sense that the story of slavery is beyond representation itself. Through exploration of famous works and unfamiliar ones she delineates a mode of radical empathy that attempts to destroy divisions between the enslaved individual and the free white subject and between the viewer and the viewed.<br />

Mass incarceration and the carceral state are hot topics in law and criminology, as the American criminal justice system faces mounting criticism for imprisoning disproportionate numbers of minorities, especially blacks. But as James Forman Jr. lays out in this book, the war on crime that saw its origins in the 1970s found a great deal of support among African American citizens, community leaders, and politicians across America&#8217;s urban landscape. Locking Up Our Own tries to understand this phenomenon.<br />

Prison became the critical space for the transformation from civil rights to Black Power, especially as southern civil rights activists faced setbacks.<br />
Black Power activists produced autobiographical writings, essays, and letters about and from prison beginning with the early sit-in movements. The author conducts rhetorical analyses of these extremely popular though understudied accounts of the Black Power movement. Through prison writings, these activists deployed narrative features supporting certain tenets of Black Power, pride in blackness, disavowal of nonviolence, identification with the Third World, and identity strategies focused on black masculinity. Prison Power fills gaps between Black Power historiography and prison studies by scrutinizing the rhetorical forms and strategies of the Black Power ideology that arose from prison politics.<br />

She examines the gender history of both private and state colleges. Evangelical Protestant commitments to personal conversions and missions fuel women&#8217;s higher education beyond rudimentary instructions preparing them for domestic life. The objective was a godly social order based on the individual relationship with God. After the Civil War the influence of religious liberals, increased emphasis on research and growing demands for women&#8217;s education instigated a reevaluation of the university&#8217;s role in moral preparation. Separate men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s and co-education institutions multiplied and moved toward seeking the public good in sex-specific ways. Women trained for social service professions; men for government and institutional leadership. The shift away from personal piety to gendered character formation and service to nation created increasingly rigid notions of separate male and female cultures in the public life of the Progressive Era. Turpin&#8217;s examination highlights the role of higher education in constructing the moral and gender map of a nation.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On September 3, 1991, a fire erupted at the Imperial Foods factory in the small town of Hamlet, North Carolina. Twenty-five people died behind the factory&#8217;s locked doors that morning. Most of the victims were women, and about half of them were black. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlV-p9JaxyayflyhWFhd4VUAAAFe8fNJogEAAAFKAczbFG4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1620972387/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1620972387&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=NxUsBoyGVlGVQ6685-r1Mg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hamlet Fire: A Tragic Story of Cheap Food, Cheap Government, and Cheap Lives</a> (<a href="http://thenewpress.com/books/hamlet-fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Press</a>, 2017), Temple University history professor <a href="http://www.cla.temple.edu/history/faculty/bryant-simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryant Simon</a> lays out the structural failures in the American and global economic systems which killed those workers. As economic growth slowed and inflation rose in the 1970s, many Americans grew disillusioned with the New Deal era promise of high wages and a robust regulatory state. Instead, Simon argues, Americans began to embrace a culture of cheap, ready-made, products and government policies which benefitted business owners, rather than employees. Food sat high atop the list of cheap items Americans craved, particularly chicken which, just before the Hamlet fire, surpassed beef as the meat most commonly consumed by American diners. It was no coincidence that the Imperial plant in Hamlet processed chicken strips and tenders for sale at national chain grocery stores. Nor was it a coincidence that Imperial relocated to North Carolina in the 1980s, as the state defunded regulatory systems and opened its doors to businesses looking for any edge in a hyper competitive market. The Hamlet Fire is a remarkable and ultimately sad story about the hidden costs of American consumption and global systems of production at the end of the twentieth century.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On July 17, 1944, a massive explosion rocked the segregated Navy base at Port Chicago, California, killing more than 300 sailors who were at the docks, critically injuring off-duty men in their bunks, and shattering windows up to a mile away. On August 9th, 244 men refused to go back to work until unsafe and unfair conditions at the docks were addressed. When the dust settled, fifty were charged with mutiny, facing decades in jail and even execution.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I own many Bibles, but curiously, I didn&#8217;t purchase any of them. They were all given to me, almost all by Protestant Christians. And, considering the history of Protestant Christianity, that impulse to freely offer &#8220;God&#8217;s word&#8221; makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://www.messiah.edu/info/21426/our_faculty/2371/john_fea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Fea</a> takes up the institutionalized giving of Bibles in a primarily American context in his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qkpvj4EECkKdzHABPikMd0IAAAFe7p6j7wEAAAFKAQEgDwg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190253061/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190253061&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=D-Gbr-YnD5Q4acYa33r2Kg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Bible Cause: A History of the American Bible Society</a> (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-bible-cause-9780190253066?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2016). Through a meticulously researched and carefully constructed chronological narrative of the American Bible Society, Fea expertly touches upon themes of foreign relations, gender, race, technology, and the changing American religious landscape from just after the Revolution to today. This fascinating work would therefore be of interest to general readers and to experts in the field, and is particularly noteworthy as it explores Christianity outside of traditional denominational lines.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Born in Russia, Arnautoff&#8217;s service as a cavalry officer for the anticommunist White forces in the Russian Civil War forced him to abandon his homeland for an involuntary exile, first in China, then in the United States. Long interested in a career as an artist, his studies of art in San Francisco during the 1920s led to a two-year period working for the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. Returning to San Francisco during the depth of the Great Depression, Arnautoff quickly emerged as one of the greatest talents on the regional art scene, with works that championed the working man and criticized the brutalities of capitalism. Arnautoff&#8217;s embrace of Communism by the end of the 1930s and his association with Soviet consular officials both during and after World War II brought increasing attention from the U.S. government during the postwar &#8220;Red Scare&#8221; era, with their monitoring of his activities ending only with his return to the Soviet Union in 1957.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For the first time, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qhll0tSg90Dd74wG_741njcAAAFez0D5HgEAAAFKAXZP0h4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0804792755/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0804792755&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=XlchBEET5A7aUadQSG.GzQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">African Americans Against the Bomb: Nuclear Weapons, Colonialism, and the Black Freedom Movement</a> (<a href="http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23490" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stanford University Press</a>, 2015) tells the compelling story of those black activists who fought for nuclear disarmament by connecting the nuclear issue with the fight for racial equality. Early on, blacks in America saw the use of atomic bombs as a racial issue, asking why such enormous resources were being spent building nuclear arms instead of being used to improve impoverished communities. Black activists&#8217; fears that race played a role in the decision to deploy atomic bombs only increased when the U.S. threatened to use nuclear weapons in Korea in the 1950s and Vietnam a decade later. For some, the nuclear issue was connected to colonialism the U.S. obtained uranium ore used to produce fissile material from the Belgian controlled Congo and the French tested their nuclear weapons in the Sahara.<br />
By expanding traditional research in the history of the nuclear disarmament movement the author reveals the links between the black freedom movement in America and issues of global peace. From Langston Hughes through Lorraine Hansberry to President Obama, African Americans Against the Bomb offers an eye-opening account of the continuous involvement of African Americans who recognized that the rise of nuclear weapons was a threat to the civil rights of all people.<br />
Author <a href="https://twitter.com/VincentIntondi?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Intondi</a> is an <a href="https://cms.montgomerycollege.edu/EDU/Department2.aspx?id=66442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Associate Professor of History</a> and Director of the Institute for Race, Justice, and Community Engagement at Montgomery College, and formerly the Director of Research for American University&#8217;s Nuclear Studies Institute. His academic research focuses on the intersection of race and nuclear weapons. In 2016, Intondi began working with the Union of Concerned Scientists exploring new efforts to expand the nuclear disarmament movement to include more diverse voices, specifically from the black community. Beyond African Americans Against the Bomb, Intondi is currently working on a new book project, which will examine the famous June 12, 1982 nuclear disarmament march in New York City.<br />

In her new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QhkVa2F_tZVSmuM978Wpf_UAAAFez1cadQEAAAFKAZWQyIU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1780238126/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1780238126&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=X03Lc3FIV8UnVDKwL6QnIg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Girls: The Invention of the Flapper</a> (<a href="http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780238128" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reaktion Books</a>, 2017), <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/english/faculty/simon.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linda Simon</a> tracks the historical narrative surrounding the flapper from the late-nineteenth century into the early decades of the twentieth century. Using sources from popular culture and from people of the time, Simon asserts that the image of the flapper did not appear out of a single historical moment but rather was invented over the decades. The flapper did not limit its impact to fashion and women&#8217;s attitudes, but also intersected with debates about race, immigration, politics, and the like. Simon&#8217;s book is an excellent and very accessible narrative on the flapper and will be of interest to anyone fascinated with gender and the history of the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century.<br />

Hawley is an <a href="https://psc.ua.edu/profiles/george-hawley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assistant professor of political science</a> at the University of Alabama. He is the author of three previous books. From the start of this book, Hawley makes clear the racism at the heart of the alt-right&#8211;or alternative right&#8211;movement, but what he is seeking, as the title suggests, is to draw subtle but important distinctions between this manifestation of racist political organizing and others. As such, Making Sense of the Alt-Right explores how the alt-right differs from traditional white nationalism, white supremacism, libertarianism, and other extremist movements. Hawley argues that the alt-right&#8217;s use of offensive humor and its adeptness at social media trolling can make it difficult to determine its objectives. He is able to synthesize a movement that not only disagrees with liberalism but also fundamentally rejects most of the principles of conservatism in the US and has been energized by President Donald Trump.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Have you thought of why your designated sex category is listed, despite your picture and all other relevant information present? <a href="https://heathfoggdavis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heath Fogg Davis</a>, in his new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkS8o2EBC7EsUEBxUQQYm74AAAFew5QdXgEAAAFKAQ5o0CQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1479855405/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1479855405&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=7jMwBKIDdt1OQ0ftPdbWpQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beyond Trans: Does Gender Matter?</a> (<a href="https://nyupress.org/books/9781479855407/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York University Press</a>, 2017) , argues that these policies are not only unnecessary but harmful to achieving gender equity. Not only do these policies effect the everyday lives of trans people, but Davis argues that these policies also limit the sexual and gender expressions for all Americans. Using four case studies, Davis examines various parts of American society that are impacted by sex-segregation policies, challenges the reader to critically re-examine sex-segregated and gendered policies, and provides a way for organizations, companies, and schools to become more gender equitable.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[From Frederick Jackson Turner to Walter Prescott Webb, the high cliffs of Yosemite to the flat deserts and blasted rock of the Nevada Test Range, the American West has long been defined by its environments. The human history of western ecologies extends back thousands of years, writes the historian <a href="http://www.weber.edu/History/faculty/Dant.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara Dant</a> in her new synthesis, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QvCaI9qv84N5SMC2OiGQW5gAAAFeqey7zgEAAAFKARj_qZY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1118934296/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1118934296&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=hkQ3zOTqSb6HALmiUMDOBA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Losing Eden: An Environmental History of the American West</a> (Wiley Blackwell, 2017). Dant, a professor of history at Weber State University in Ogden, Utah, traces the history of how people changed, and in turn were changed by, the American West&#8217;s myriad environments.<br />
In Losing Eden, Dant describes how pre-contact societies made water flow in the desert, how Spanish colonizers introduced fauna to the region now taken for granted as decidedly &#8220;western,&#8221; and how American commodification of the non-human world fundamentally altered human perceptions of western landscapes. By the late nineteenth century, the concept of commodification had led to both great material wealth for the United States, and almost irreparable damage to western environments. It was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that, according to Dant, some Americans began to look upon their &#8220;lost Eden&#8221; and ask, &#8220;at what cost?&#8221; Losing Eden is a book which, at heart, seeks to disprove the notion that the American West was ever an Eden at all by showing that the history of environmental change in the region is as old as human footsteps on western soil, while also arguing for a new ethic of collective action to reverse some of the most far reaching changes wrought by humans in the American West.<br />

Braunstein is assistant professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut. There are many reasons to think of the political Right and Left as so deeply polarized that there have almost nothing in common. Civil society organizations pursuing opposite policy aims, however, may share much in common. Braunstein&#8217;s book tracks two such organizations which share little in terms of policy agenda, but a lot when it comes to strategy and identity. Both groups believe strongly in democracy, religion, and holding government accountable to the people. This populist streak brings the approach taken to politics together across the two groups. Prophets and Patriots contributes to what we know about how social movement and civil society organizations see the world and the considerable overlap between groups of very different political orientations.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QnR7AGJj0rdEm-qUq16mA2sAAAFen96SfwEAAAFKAVt8pOA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1316643484/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1316643484&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=4XnO6eoHICXurseeXlfVLw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Weeping Time: Memory and the Largest Slave Auction in American History</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2017), <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/history/people/faculty/acbailey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anne C. Bailey</a>, an associate professor of history and Africana studies at Binghamton University SUNY, tells the story of the largest slave auction in U.S. history. In March 1859, the Butler Plantation estates in Georgia sold approximately 400 enslaved persons in a two-day period. Bailey uncovers the lives of enslaved people before and after their sale at the auction, offering a gripping narrative of the event and the people involved through the use of oral histories, journalistic accounts of the auction, and the papers of the Butlers. Bailey&#8217;s book pushes readers to think about how the traditional historical narrative treats slavery, specifically by considering slavery&#8217;s ongoing impact on modern-day descendants and their families.<br />
In this episode of <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/african-american-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in African American Studies</a>, Anne Bailey discusses The Weeping Time and the role of the auction block in shaping the memory and meaning of slavery from the antebellum era to the present day. Bailey emphasizes the power of family in crafting the meaning of freedom in the Reconstruction era and beyond. She also discusses the importance of the democratization of memory and its influence in her current work. The Weeping Time presents the auction block as a lens through which to analyze this traumatic chapter in U.S. history as well as examine the resilience of enslaved people and their descendants in recovering familial bonds and histories.<br />

Starting in 1982 as the birth of millennials, Scott examines how millennials have been impacted by the economic and social changes of the 1980s and neoliberalism. Scott takes readers through defining moments and experiences such as latchkey parents, changing representations of masculinity, pop culture feminism, September 11th, and Hurricane Katrina. He uses popular culture examples to define these moments comparing September 11th to Jay-Z&#8217;s The Blueprint and using the career of LeBron James to critique corporate relocation and its effects on economic livelihoods. Scott&#8217;s well-research book presents readers with a challenge to rethink how millennials are defined and critiqued as he challenges millennials to learn from the mistakes of the past and work for lasting change.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If you were a cadet at West Point and knew with virtual certainty that upon graduation you would be sent into the teeth of the Vietnam war, what would you do? Well, if you were <a href="https://carhartthegoldenfleece.com/about-the-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Carhart</a> and five of his buddies, you&#8217;d decide to have one last hurrah and steal the Navy&#8217;s mascot before the Army-Navy game. Students at West Point had stolen said mascot&#8211;&#8220;Bill the Goat&#8221;&#8211;once before, namely in 1954. To avoid further embarrassment at the hands of its arch-rivals, the Navy thereafter placed &#8220;Bill&#8221; in a high-security facility under Marine guard. No matter, Tom and his fellow cadets said. Even if they were caught (and they knew they would be found out eventually), what could the Army do? Send them to Vietnam? That was in the works anyway. So, as Tom explains in his terrific book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QktLlHg4Xilkk1PBi0t4p5sAAAFeh4TK-AEAAAFKAbnAS-Q/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1612349102/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1612349102&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=43h4kFf4ShS.WNgrHBKm5A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Golden Fleece: High-Risk Adventure at West Point</a> (Potomac Books, 2017), off they went to steal the goat&#8230;and off they went to Vietnam.<br />
Tom&#8217;s a great storyteller, and his book is at moments funny and touching. Moreover, he offers deep insight into what it was like to be a cadet in the 1960s, to know that you were going to war, and to go to war and come back. Not everyone did, of course. I highly recommend you pick up The Golden Fleece.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Recent popular and scholarly interest has highlighted the complex and brutal system of mass incarceration in the United States. Much of this interest has focused on recent developments while other scholars have revealed the connections between the development of the prison system after Reconstruction and the legacies of slavery. In her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuTAo5XzaOJPZmlgySL91L0AAAFeghAsEQEAAAFKAd7sLAA/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469627590/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1469627590&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=nkoQERYJDuvWjCSF8s20Mw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Mercy Here: Gender, Punishment, and the Making of Jim Crow Modernity</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469627595/no-mercy-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016), Sarah Haley points to an often under recognized part of this history. <a href="https://twitter.com/sahaley?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haley</a>, an <a href="http://www.genderstudies.ucla.edu/faculty/sarah-haley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">associate professor of gender studies and African American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles</a>, focuses on the Southern criminal justice system&#8217;s treatment and exploitation of black women during the Jim Crow era. Though black women were caught up in the criminal justice system in smaller numbers than men were, Haley shows their treatment was very important to the development of Jim Crow modernity. The brutal and violent treatment, the ideological narratives surrounding black women, and the exploitation of their labor were all key in creating the ideologies of racial capitalism and patriarchy. Haley also discusses the ways black women resisted this treatment and contented the related ideologies.<br />
In this episode of <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in History</a>, Haley discusses No Mercy Here and this history of gender, criminal justice, and race. She tells listeners about some of experiences of black women in this criminal justice system, explaining the development of the system from convict leasing to chain gangs with an the exploitative parole system. Haley also clearly explains the ideological role this system played in the development of the Jim Crow system. Finally, Haley also discusses some of her research and the challenges of accurately and thoroughly portraying the experiences of women whose voices were mediated by the criminal justice system.<br />

He traces how cities&#8217; physical landscape changed as ideas about the nature of their social life were reconceived. Beginning with Frederick Law Olmsted in the nineteenth century who expressed anxiety over the erosion of social sympathy, to the progressive era&#8217;s deployment of the family ideal for urban friendships, to mid-century models that saw these relationships as part of and analogous to an ecological system. Along the way he examines the thought of Jane Addams, W.E.B. Du Bois, the journalists at the New Yorker, Rachel Carson and Jane Jacobs and the disruptive force of urban renewal projects. Rowan provides the reader with a new way to value &#8220;sociable fellow-feelings&#8221; in the midst of the diversity and the rapid change of today&#8217;s cities.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the third podcast of <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/arguing-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arguing History</a>, historians William J. Cooper and Richard Carwardine address the question of the role presidential leadership played in determining the outcome of the American Civil War. Considering the respective positions of both Abraham Lincoln and his Confederate counterpart Jefferson Davis, they discuss the respective backgrounds of the two men, the political environment in which each of them operated, their relationship to their military commanders, and their contributions to the questions of slavery and emancipation as they pertained to the war. In discussing their abilities and actions, Carwardine and Cooper describe some of the important ways in which the two men shaped the conflict and its legacy for us today, in ways both intended and unexpected.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Scholars regularly assert that at Chicago&#8217;s World&#8217;s Parliament of Religions in 1893 Swami Vivekananda initiated Hinduism in America. Many histories of Hinduism in America reproduce this type of synthesizing narrative. But how was Hinduism defined by Vivekananda and how was it understood by his American audience? How did it relate to the various South Asian religious practices and beliefs that are subsumed under this term Hinduism?<br />
In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qjzl2NrU3aLvKYp-cNOUscgAAAFecSFf0AEAAAFKAcLnhfo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190654929/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190654929&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=fWMyyHBj.PzPoKcaYbyezQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heathen, Hindoo, Hindu: American Representations of India, 1721-1893</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017), <a href="http://michaeljaltman.com/">Michael J. Altman</a>, Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama, tackles literary and visual accounts of religion in India to understand the production of the category Hinduism in America. He provides an episodic genealogy of the ways in which South Asians were constructed in the American imaginary. Instead of reclassifying the various terminology used by missionaries, columnists, or Transcendentalists as Hinduism Altman carefully plots the social, political, and theological claims invested in those terms.<br />
In our conversation we discuss early American religious culture, category construction, evangelical knowledge production, orientalist discourses, displays of South Asia material culture, Unitarians, Transcendentalists, and the Theosophical Society, Rammohan Roy, Protestant morality and national culture, public schools education, missionary accounts, and the contours of American Religious Studies.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since its infancy, television has played an important role in shaping U.S. values and the American sense of self. Social activists recognized this power immediately and, consequently, set about trying to influence television&#8217;s portrayal of those values by securing access to and a voice in the medium. <a href="http://www.faculty.uci.edu//profile.cfm?faculty_id=5878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Allison Perlman</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QuSu-EECR3uBzE2eR1xOFhcAAAFeYf-GAgEAAAFKAZOZhbU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0813572290/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0813572290&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=gy6Tus.iDp777ejBtA19-A&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Interests: Media Advocacy and Struggles Over U.S. Television</a> (Rutgers University Press, 2016) examines some these efforts, including those among African Americans, women, and parents among others, between the 1940s and the early 2000s. Perlman, an associate professor of film and media students and history at the University of California, Irvine, thus, shows that media law and regulation was an important site of debate and activism. Social activists recognized television&#8217;s power and that ensuring their own views, voices, and identities were represented on the screen could be influential in promoting their cause. Both conservative and liberal activists worked hard to use existing laws to shape television ownership and programing. In the process, activists also worked to shape the definition of the public and weighed in on questions surrounding how to define and promote the &#8220;public interest,&#8221; as required by law. By the 1980s, deregulation reshaped the landscape, but did not end the importance of the arena for activists.<br />
In this episode of New Books in History, Perlman discusses Public Interests and this history of media advocacy. She tells listeners about some of these social activists&#8217; campaigns to influence FCC policies nationally as well as about more localized efforts to shape television programing. She also explains why these battles were important in shaping the broadcasting environment even if they did not always achieve their stated goal. She discusses the importance of deregulation in later media regulation advocacy. Perlman makes clear that a simple declension story is inaccurate even in this later period and discusses these battles&#8217; continued relevance today.<br />

With the rising global demand for cotton &#8211; and thus, slaves &#8211; in the 1840s and 1850s, the need for white laborers in the American South was drastically reduced, creating a large underclass who were unemployed or underemployed. These poor whites could not compete &#8211; for jobs or living wages &#8211; with profitable slave labor. Though impoverished whites were never subjected to the daily violence and degrading humiliations of racial slavery, they did suffer tangible socio-economic consequences as a result of living in a slave society. The author examines how these &#8216;masterless&#8217; men and women threatened the existing Southern hierarchy and ultimately helped push Southern slaveholders toward secession and civil war.<br />
<a href="http://www.kerileighmerritt.com">Keri Leigh Merritt</a> is an independent scholar from Atlanta, Georgia. She received her B.A. in History and Political Science from Emory University, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in History from the University of Georgia. Her research generally focuses on race and class in American history. Merritt&#8217;s work on poverty and inequality has garnered multiple awards, and she also writes historical pieces for the public, with letters and essays appearing in Aeon, on <a href="http://www.billmoyers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BillMoyers.com</a>, and in The New York Times.<br />
In addition to Masterless Men, Merritt has a forthcoming co-edited book on southern labor history with University of West Georgia historian Matthew Hild tentatively titled Reviving Southern Labor History: Race, Class, and Power. She is also currently conducting research for two additional book-length projects; the first is on black resistance in the vastly understudied Reconstruction era, and the second project examines the changing role of law enforcement in the mid-nineteenth century south. Masterless Men: Poor Whites in the Antebellum South is her first book.<br />

Fox</a> bring together an exceptional cadre of scholars to dispel the notion that Latinas/os are newcomers to the Midwest. Through seventeen penetrating essays, this collection explores the trajectory of Latina/o migration, their demographic transformation of the Midwest, importance as laborers, neighbors, and community builders, as well as their struggles to obtain social and economic justice. Collectively, the essays within this anthology make several important interventions concerning the distinctiveness of the Midwest in the Latina/o experience and the effect it has had on identity formation and social activism. The presentation of the Midwest as a &#8220;border space&#8221; (i.e., contact zone) for Latina/o migrants from various parts of Latin America is a central theme that runs throughout the book. This anthology is an essential addition to Latina/o studies scholarship as it challenges the bi-coastal normativity and exclusivity of existing scholarship.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the late 19th century New York socialites enjoyed a newfound celebrity status thanks to their conspicuous wealth and the attention of the rapidly expanding newspaper industry. Many of these women sought to use their status to promote causes important to them, most notably the suffrage movement. <a href="http://www.johannaneuman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johanna Neuman</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QsAlKW-8fQgh8et9T_6xXS4AAAFeLoutlgEAAAFKAXoYbdU/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1479837067/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1479837067&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=N3Ed4Alcw3pRQGKvYTephQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gilded Suffragists: The New York Socialites Who Fought for Women&#8217;s Right to Vote</a> (<a href="https://nyupress.org/books/9781479837069/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York University Press</a>, 2017) describes the role they played in the suffrage campaigns in fin-de-siecle America, one that saw social rank exploited to advance a radical cause. As Neuman explains, their efforts in support of the enfranchisement of women were the most dramatic example of their growing degree of involvement in public affairs, as elite women worked to advance a variety of causes dear to them. Coming at a time when the suffrage movement was becalmed by setbacks and disagreements over goals, their participation gave the effort much-needed resources and energy. By organizing rallies, raising funds, and even campaigning personally on behalf of suffrage measures and against anti-suffrage politicians, their contributions played a vital role in winning for women the right to vote, both in New York and nationally.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>In 1845 two thinkers from the American hemisphere – the Argentinean statesman Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and the fugitive ex-slave, abolitionist leader, and orator from the United States, Frederick Douglass – both published their first works.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1845 two thinkers from the American hemisphere &#8211; the Argentinean statesman Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and the fugitive ex-slave, abolitionist leader, and orator from the United States, Frederick Douglass &#8211; both published their first works. Each would become the most famous and enduring texts in what were both prolific careers, and they ensured Sarmiento and Douglass&#8217; position as leading figures in the canon of Latin American and U.S. African-American political thought, respectively. But despite the fact that both deal directly with key political and philosophical questions in the Americas, Douglass and Sarmiento, like African-American and Latin American thought more generally, are never read alongside each other. Still, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0190633697/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Theorizing Race in the Americas: Douglass, Sarmiento, Du Bois, and Vasconcelos</a> (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/theorizing-race-in-the-americas-9780190633691?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2017) contends, looking at the two together allows one to chart a hemispheric intellectual geography of race that challenges political theory&#8217;s preoccupation with and assumptions about East / West comparisons, and questions the use of comparison as a tool in the production of theory and philosophy.<br />
By juxtaposing four prominent nineteenth and twentieth-century thinkers &#8211; Frederick Douglass, Domingo F. Sarmiento, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Jose Vasconcelos &#8211; Theorizing Race in the Americas will be the first to bring African-American and Latin American political thought into conversation. The book stresses that Latin American and U.S. ideas about race were not developed in isolation, but grew out of transnational intellectual exchanges across the Americas. In so doing, she shows that nineteenth and twentieth-century U.S. and Latin American thinkers each looked to political models in the &#8216;other&#8217; America to advance racial projects in their own countries. Reading these four intellectuals as hemispheric thinkers, the author foregrounds elements of their work that have been dismissed by dominant readings, and provides a crucial platform to bridge the canons of Latin American and African-American political thought.<br />

She earned her undergraduate degree from Williams College, and her M.A. and Ph.D. from Cornell University.

Hooker&#8217;s research interests have focused on theories of multiculturalism, Latin American political thought, and Afro-descendant and indigenous politics in Latin America.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[To remember Nathaniel Bowditch today primarily for his famous navigational textbook is to acknowledge only one of his many achievements. As <a href="http://history.buffalo.edu/faculty/thornton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Plakins Thornton</a> demonstrates in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469626934/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Bowditch and the Power of Numbers: How a Nineteenth-Century Man of Business, Science, and the Sea Changed American Life</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469626932/nathaniel-bowditch-and-the-power-of-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016), Bowditch&#8217;s legacy is one that endures in a surprising range of fields. The son of a luckless merchant captain, Bowditch grew up in the early years of the new republic. At an early age he was apprenticed at a young age to a ship&#8217;s chandler, which introduced him to the world of maritime commerce. His aptitude for mathematics led him to identify numerous errors in the standard navigational text he used while on commercial voyages, and his revisions established the book colloquially known by his name today. Yet this was only at the beginning of a long and prosperous career in business, as he moved from commerce to insurance and banking. As Thornton explains, Bowditch&#8217;s mathematically-honed passion for order and precision was employed to systematize traditionally irregular business practices in ways that are reflected in the modern workplace, while his use of trusts to preserve family fortunes ensured the perpetuation of an entire New England social class. Such was his success that Bowditch became one of the Brahmin elite of nineteenth-century Boston society, while his achievements in mathematics and astronomy helped to make him a national icon by the time of his death.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0199731616/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Martyr of Liberty: Crispus Attucks in American Memory </a>(<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/first-martyr-of-liberty-9780199731619?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oxford University Press</a>, 2017) explores how Crispus Attucks&#8217; death in the 1770 Boston Massacre led to his achieving mythic significance in African Americans&#8217; struggle to incorporate their experiences and heroes into the mainstream of the American historical narrative. While the other victims of the Boston Massacre have been largely ignored, Attucks is widely celebrated as the first to die in the cause of freedom during the era of the American Revolution. He became a symbolic embodiment of black patriotism and citizenship.<br />
First Martyr of Liberty traces Attucks&#8217; career through both history and myth to understand how his public memory has been constructed through commemorations and monuments; institutions and organizations bearing his name; juvenile biographies; works of poetry, drama, and visual arts; popular and academic histories; and school textbooks. There will likely never be a definitive biography of Crispus Attucks since so little evidence exists about the man&#8217;s actual life. While what can and cannot be known about Attucks is addressed here, the focus is on how he has been remembered variously&#8211;as either a hero or a villain&#8211;and why at times he has been forgotten by different groups and individuals from the eighteenth century to the present day.<br />
<a href="https://wmich.edu/history/directory/kachun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitch Kachun</a> is Professor of History at Western Michigan University. He studied anthropology at Penn State University and studied history at Illinois State University before earning his M.A. and Ph.D. in history from Cornell. Kachun&#8217;s research focuses on how African Americans during the 19th and 20th centuries used historical writing and public commemorations to work for equal rights, construct a sense of collective identity, and claim control over their status and destiny in American society. His first book was Festivals of Freedom: Memory and Meaning in African American Emancipation Celebrations, 1808-1915, and he was the co-editor of The Curse of Caste; or the Slave Bride: A Rediscovered African American Novel by Julia C. Collins. After First Martyr of Liberty Mitch Kachun&#8217;s next book-length project will be a biographical accounting of the early 20th Century African-American journalist Charles Stewart, tentatively titled The Life and Times of Colonel J. O. Midnight.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week on the podcast, <a href="https://www.jbu.edu/majors/political_science/faculty/?id=22260" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Bennet</a> joins us to talk about his new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0700624600/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Defending Faith: The Politics of the Christian Conservative Legal Movement </a>(<a href="https://kansaspress.ku.edu/978-0-7006-2460-7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University Press of Kansas</a>, 2017). Bennett is assistant professor of political science at John Brown University. From Hobby Lobby to Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court has ruled on controversial social policy issues. At the center of many of these cases are a set of legal organizations, what Bennett calls Christian Conservative Legal Organizations or CCLOs, including the American Center for Law and Justice and Alliance Defending Freedom. In his book, he explains how CCLOs advocate for issues central to Christian conservatives, highlights the influence of religious liberty on the CLM&#8217;s broader agenda, and reveals how the Christian Right has become accustomed to the courts as a field of battle in today&#8217;s culture wars. Bennett studies these groups as a type of interest group and legal advocacy the primary strategy to fulfill their interests.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Two professors from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, Canada have published a book about how American popular culture reinforces militarism in the United States. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0739146807/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop Culture Goes to War: Enlisting and Resisting Militarism in the War on Terror</a> (Lexington Books, 2010) <a href="https://www.mta.ca/uploadedFiles/Community/Academics/Faculty_of_Social_Sciences/Politics_and_International_Relations/Faculty_and_Staff/G%20Martin%20CV%20April%202017[2].pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Martin</a> and <a href="https://mta.ca/Community/Academics/Faculty_of_Social_Sciences/Sociology/Faculty_and_Staff/Faculty_and_Staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erin Steuter</a> argue that popular songs, Hollywood movies, professional sports, TV news and even children&#8217;s toys help generate public support for the use of military force to solve political problems such as international terrorism. At the same time, they also argue that other elements of popular culture such as The Daily Show, the Colbert Report and The Simpsons, for example, actively resist militarism with pointed political comedy and satire.<br />
In this New Books Network interview, Steuter and Martin say their book was inspired in part by the ideas of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. who preached against the War in Vietnam. &#8220;We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation,&#8221; King declared in a speech delivered a year before he was assassinated in 1968. Professors Steuter and Martin argue that King&#8217;s opposition to militarism is as relevant today during the seemingly endless post 9/11 War on Terror, as it was then.<br />
Erin Steuter teaches sociology at Mount Allison, in Sackville, New Brunswick while her partner, Geoff Martin is a professor of political science there.<br />

Essays by contributors <a href="https://www.colby.edu/directory/profile/lauren.lessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Lessing</a>, Seth A. Thayer, Jr., <a href="https://www.colby.edu/directory/profile/elizabeth.finch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Finch</a> and <a href="http://web.colby.edu/tsheehan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tanya Sheehan</a> offer new insights into the definition and display of folk art. How should folk art fit into constructions of the American past and understandings of American Art? Individual entries detail the rich history of a variety of 19th Century American folk art objects from young women&#8217;s so-called accomplishment needlework pieces to portraiture and landscape painting by self-trained artists.<br />

What is the consequence of the rapid spin of the revolving door in Washington? Once a rarity, today nearly half of members of Congress join a lobbying firm after their time on the Hill ends. In Revolving Door Lobbying, the authors show that they are not alone. Former aides join the ranks of lobbyists and generate massive amounts of revenue for lobbying and law firms. These patterns have changed the political economy of Washington politics. LaPira and Thomas mine a decade of new Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA) data to show the way the rise of revolving door lobbying has made representation less equal and enhanced private influence.<br />

She explores their motivations and experiences, as well as their disappointments and disillusionment, to rehabilitate not USSR itself but the real depth of interest, hope and fascination that the Soviet Union represented to many people. In doing so, she demonstrates the ways in which Russian radicalism intertwined with American feminism in the early twentieth century. She also explores questions of loyalty to ones beliefs, country and family through the lives of women such as activist Anna Louise Strong, journalist Millie Bennett, dancer Pauline Koner and Ruth Epperson Kennell, who worked in a Siberian industrial colony.<br />

Helmsley uses her keen eye, rich life experience, and incredible humor to get readers to consider and swallow hard truths, while also considering the wider cultural implications. A friend&#8217;s questions regarding the subject matter of her work (often continued reflection upon the complexity of her youth), posed on the night before her 40th birthday, acted as a springboard for this collection, and the 2016 presidential election results of cemented the deal. Helmsley has crafted sophisticated essays about the confluence of the late 20th-century television, art, and sexual fantasy; addiction and illness; school shootings and serial killers; family; Andy Warhol; &#8216;Mork and Mindy&#8217;; and the sleazy (yet sexy) misogyny of Axl Rose&#8230;&#8221; She stares down what many would avert our eyes from, and probes, with curiosity and openness the many contours of shame, until it becomes a terrain of connection for her readers.<br />
Fiona Helmsley&#8217;s writing can be found online at websites like The Rumpus, Jezebel, The Weeklings, The Hairpin, PANK and in various anthologies like Ladyland and The Best Sex Writing of the Year. A multiple Pushcart nominee, her book of essays and stories, My Body Would be the Kindest of Strangers was released in 2015.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[No book was more accessible or familiar to the American founders than the Bible, and no book was more frequently alluded to or quoted from in the political discourse of the age. How and for what purposes did the founding generation use the Bible? How did the Bible influence their political culture?<br />
Shedding new light on some of the most familiar rhetoric of the founding era, <a href="http://www.american.edu/spa/faculty/ddreisb.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Dreisbach</a> analyzes the founders&#8217; diverse use of scripture, ranging from the literary to the theological. He shows that they looked to the Bible for insights on human nature, civic virtue, political authority, and the rights and duties of citizens, as well as for political and legal models to emulate. They quoted Scripture to authorize civil resistance, to invoke divine blessings for righteous nations, and to provide the language of liberty that would be appropriated by patriotic Americans.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199987939/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reading the Bible with the Founding Fathers</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016) broaches the perennial question of whether the American founding was, to some extent, informed by religious&#8211;specifically Christian&#8211;ideas. In the sense that the founding generation were members of a biblically literate society that placed the Bible at the center of culture and discourse, the answer to that question is clearly yes. Ignoring the Bible&#8217;s influence on the founders, Dreisbach warns, produces a distorted image of the American political experiment, and of the concept of self-government on which America is built.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The majority of the books we profile on New Books in Military History are traditional research narratives, monographs written by historians and authors seeking to present a particular campaign, organization, battle, or individual in detail. Once in a while, though, we take pride in introducing our listeners to projects that are more focused on how memory and history are intertwined, bringing the past to the present. In this episode, we speak with New York Times travel writer and amateur historian <a href="https://www.richardrubinonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Rubin</a> about his own thoughts on the First World War and how it shaped a special relationship between many Frenchmen and the ideal of America that survives to this day. His most recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250084326/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back Over There: One American Time-Traveler, 100 Years Since the Great War, 500 Miles of Battle-Scarred French Countryside, and Too Many Trenches, Shells, Legends, and Ghosts to Count</a> (St. Martins Press, 2017), is a deeply personal account of Rubin&#8217;s many walks across the Western Front and his encounters with local caretakers, fellow tourists and pilgrims, and everyday people in Belgium and France. Our discussion is more of a conversation about the state of memory and the daily encounters with history that, prior to this point, remained largely unknown to so many people. The interview, and Rubin&#8217;s book, are tactile reminders of the history that lies, quite literally, just beneath our feet . . . if we know how and where to look for it.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Job seekers are increasingly being taught that they need to sell themselves as if they were their own business, and what will set them apart from other applicants is not their skills or their experience, but the distinctiveness of their brand. Join us for a provocative discussion about how workers are being taught to position themselves to employers, and how modern labor markets, as a consequence, differ from those in the past &#8212; and why that matters.<br />

The text specifically interrogates the theoretical concepts of postracialism and postfeminism and the discourse surrounding these terms and their meaning. Kennedy examines these ideas, where they were initially linked together, and how they have been pursued separately, often without attention paid to the intersectional nature of how race and gender actually interact within American culture and society. Historicizing Post-Discourses examines these concepts within a variety of cultural venues, including television series like Mad Men, The Wire, and Gray&#8217;s Anatomy; within films like The Help, Perfect Stranger, The Blind Side, and Monsters Ball; within popular non-fiction like Lean-In and The End of Men; and in political speeches and rhetoric that have been integrated into our culture, often without historically clear contexts. Postracialism and postfeminism have become frameworks that often reify cultural and political tropes within American society, and Kennedy&#8217;s book explores how these frameworks and narratives reaffirm heroic notions of individualism and triumphalism, especially in our popular culture consumption.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://womensstudies.barnard.edu/profiles/rosalind-rosenberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosalind Rosenberg</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/019065645X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jane Crow: The Life of Pauli Murray</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017) is a multi-layered and rich biography of Pauli Murray, an activist, lawyer and Episcopal priest whose life intersected with the most significant civil and human rights issues of the twentieth century. As a mixed raced woman who felt that her identity was at odds with her body before transsexual had become part of the popular consciousness, Murray&#8217;s life provides insight into a lived intersectionality of race, class, gender, and sexuality. Beginning with her southern upbringing, we follow Murray through multiple educational, vocational and identity challenges she suffered. In a journey through a dislocated life, she contributed to multiple movements and institutions working with many key social leaders such as Thurgood Marshall, Eleanor Roosevelt and Betty Friedan. Appearing as a one-person social movement with a deep religious faith she pursued justice not only for herself but also for others. Rosenberg has provided sympathetic insight into the personal cost that Murray incurred on the road to a more equitable society. Rosalind Rosenberg is Professor of History Emerita at Barnard College.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The influential yet controversial psychiatrist, Harry Stack Sullivan was pioneering in his treatment of schizophrenia however the way he lived privately did not always correspond to the theoretical ideas he espoused publicly. With meticulous research and access to clinical and historical records, historian<a href="http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/naoko-wake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naoko Wake</a>, examines the life and work of this pioneer of American Psychoanalysis from an unconventional perspective, quite different than the usual biographical approach. In this interview we discuss Sullivan&#8217;s sometimes contradictory life work, especially his time at Sheppard-Pratt Hospital, his private practice in New York, and his wider, global ambitions later in life.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPW5LHV/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Americans? Immigration, Protest, and The Politics of Latino Identity</a> (University Press of Kansas, 2017) by <a href="https://www2.clarku.edu/departments/politicalscience/facultybio.cfm?id=967&amp;progid=16&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heather Silber Mohamed</a> weaves together a number of different strands within the discipline of Political Science in context of the diverse Latino community in the United States. Silber Mohamed integrates analysis of social identity and citizenship, social movements and protest politics, immigration policy, and the multiplicity of communities within the Latino-American population in the U.S. The research for The New Americans? is broad and complex, but the centerpiece of the book are the protests and demonstrations in 2006 in regard to the immigration reform bill that the George W. Bush Administration advocated, and that was debated in the House and the Senate. This piece of legislation and the national conversation that it engendered is the unique case study that Silber Mohamed delves into to expose and analyze the relationship between social movements and understandings of identity and identity-framing, especially within the contemporary Latino-American communities. Silber Mohamed integrated the results from the Latino National Survey in her analysis of political attitudes and shifts of attitudes during this public debate. She traces the history and experiences of distinct groups within the broad umbrella of the American Latino community, explaining the different approaches each group has towards immigration policy and their understanding of citizenship and political advocacy. Given the more recent high profile and polarizing discussion of immigration in the United States, Silber Mohamed&#8217;s book is important contribution to this complex policy arena and our understanding of the many dimensions and political actors within the immigration debate.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In our era of economic instability, rising inequality, and widespread immigration, complaints about fairness and life chances are coming from an interesting source: white people, specifically members of the working class. This group was once central to the politics of the United States and United Kingdom, and national pride and identity were synonymous with the blue-collar work these people did. Today they live in a country that they feel is no longer &#8220;for them.&#8221; They feel powerless, as minority groups do.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190632550/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), Assistant Professor of Public Policy <a href="http://gest.gmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin Gest</a> examines how this group has been relegated to the political margins in their respective countries, and what the consequences have been for their identity and political behavior. Gest focuses on Youngstown, Ohio and East London, which he considers to be two &#8220;post-traumatic&#8221; cities, or places that have experienced major economic loss without sufficient replacement, and have never fully recovered. The story, of course, is the decline of manufacturing, and Gest reveals the significant political impacts of this devastating transformation. Based on research conducted before the Brexit vote and the campaign and election of Donald Trump, this enlightening book provides much-needed explanations for how these key events came to be embraced by a large swath of their country&#8217;s populations. Most importantly, it does so by meeting this underprivileged group where they live, and letting them voice their concerns. People from all political backgrounds ought to listen.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1588396134/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marsden Hartley&#8217;s Maine</a> (<a href="http://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9781588396136/marsden-hartleys-maine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yale University Press</a>, 2017), published to accompany a major exhibition of his work organized by The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Colby College Museum of Art, traces the artist&#8217;s complex relationship to his native state. Essays examine Hartley&#8217;s negotiation of various identities including that of the American individualist, the native son, and the avant garde Modernist. Hartley&#8217;s literary work and interests in the Green Acre Transcendentalist community are also discussed. The book reveals how in his quest to serve as &#8220;the painter from Maine,&#8221; Hartley contended with the legacies of depictions of the region by earlier American painters, as well as questions of the role of technology on the landscape among others. The book features a chapter on new studies of Hartley&#8217;s materials and techniques that provide insight into his artistic process. An extensive Chronology that situates events in Hartley&#8217;s career amidst socio-cultural and historical events is included.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Before the 1960s, doctors were generally in control of the treatment of drug addicts. And that made a certain sense, because drug addicts had something that looked a lot like a disease or mental illness. The trouble was that doctors had no effective way to treat drug addiction. Their best idea&#8211;Federal &#8220;narcotics farms,&#8221; one in Kentucky and one in Texas&#8211;kept junkies clean, but only by keeping them away from the drugs those junkies craved. In that sense, they were no more effective than prisons, though in fairness drug farms offered various treatment regimens that enabled some addicts to get and stay clean. Other than locking them up, the medical establishment had no good answer to the question &#8220;How do you cure someone of narcotics addiction?&#8221; Essentially, then, junkies (who could not spontaneously &#8220;kick,&#8221; and a lot do) usually ended up in one of three places: on the street, behind bars, or dead.<br />
Enter Charles Dederich. In 1958, Dederich, a veteran of AA and ex-drug addict, decided that addicts should take their treatment into their own hands, much like Bill Wilson and Bob Smith had done with AA in the late 1930s. He took what he learned in AA, adapted it, and created a long-term residential &#8220;therapeutic community&#8221; expressly for addicts and run by addicts. He called it Synanon, and with it he started what <a href="http://www.clairedclark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claire D. Clark</a> calls &#8220;the recovery revolution.&#8221;<br />
In her terrific book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231176384/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Recovery Revolution: The Battle Over Addiction Treatment in the United States</a> (Columbia University Press, 2017), Clark tells the story of Dederich and those who followed him (literally and chronologically) in trying to find a way to treat narcotics addiction. It&#8217;s a tale of ebbs and flows, successes and failures, enthusiasm and exhaustion lasting sixty years. Clark makes clear that the &#8220;recovery revolution&#8221; is not over by any means&#8211;we are still groping toward a good answer to the question &#8220;How do you cure someone of narcotics addiction?&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Before Transgender actors entered popular culture, and before the &#8220;T&#8221; was included in LGBT, Transgender activism was a small and marginalized movement. However, though courage and perseverance, Transgender rights began to enter the public consciousness. Drawing on her own life story, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riki_Wilchins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riki Wilchin&#8217;s</a> newest book<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1626013683/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> TRANS/gressive: How Transgender Activists took on Gay Rights, Feminism, the Media &amp; Congress&#8230;and Won!</a> (Riverdale Avenue Books, 2017) traces the origins of the Transgender movement. From the backwoods of rural Michigan to the nation&#8217;s capital, the movement challenged not only conservative politicians and worldviews but also challenged the boundaries of gender, sex, and sexuality within more progressive movements. How do Trans issues and concerns intersect with notions of masculinity and femininity? What was the relationship between the Trans movement and the Gay movement? How do movements transcend the local and become national? Wilchins offers answers to these (and many more) questions within the pages of TRANS/gressive.<br />
In addition to TRANS/gressive, Wilchins is also author to three other books on topics of gender and sexuality: Read My Lips: Sexual Subversion &amp; the End of Gender, Queer Theory/Gender Theory: An Instant Primer, and Voice from Beyond the Sexual Binary. Wilchins&#8217; works has been featured in many periodicals, and Riki has held many trainings on gender norms and nonconformity for audiences that include the White House, Centers for Disease Control, and the office on Women&#8217;s Health. Continuing her activism as well as her authorship, Wilchins expects another forthcoming book in the near future.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[To remember Patrick Henry for his defiant declaration &#8220;Give me liberty or give me death!&#8221; is to overlook a long career spent as an advocate for the rights of Americans, first as colonists and then as citizens. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/143919081X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty</a> (Simon and Schuster, 2017), <a href="http://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Jon-Kukla/71494925" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Kukla </a>describes the course of Henry&#8217;s eventful life and how he developed his views on individual rights and other matters. The son of Virginia planters, as a young man Henry turned to the law to earn his living. His arguments in the famous &#8220;Parson&#8217;s Cause&#8221; legal case foreshadowed his case for colonial rights during the Stamp Act crisis, which cemented his standing as one of the leading opponents of Britain&#8217;s efforts to impose taxes upon the colonies. Henry was at the forefront of Virginia&#8217;s move towards independence in 1775, and as its first elected governor he led the commonwealth during years of crisis and turmoil. This experience, as Kukla explains, helped define his opposition to ratifying the Constitution in 1787-8, an opposition which the documents proponents addressed by agreeing to include the Bill of Rights which it possesses today.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We are nearly a decade removed from the start of the Great Recession, and many indicators show that the economy is doing relatively well. But during this economic catastrophe, a significant number of people faced long-term unemployment, especially in the manufacturing sector. Jobs that were once the picture of stability and security, and that helped form a vibrant post-war middle class in the United States, disappeared as companies downsized, outsourced, and retooled.<br />
In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520283015/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cut Loose: Jobless and Hopeless in an Unfair Economy </a>(University of California Press, 2015), Assistant Professor of Sociology <a href="https://victortanchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Tan Chen </a>examines former autoworkers&#8212;perhaps the most iconic of blue-collar American jobs&#8212;and their experiences with long-term unemployment. Upon getting laid off from their jobs, these workers confront a completely different labor market from what they were used to. No longer can they succeed based solely on hard work&#8212;the idea of meritocracy that they have all embraced as an ideal. They learn about the higher education they need, the soft skills many jobs require, the social networks they lack, and the constant self-branding workers must now do. Believing in meritocracy, and in society&#8217;s widespread culture of judgment, these workers come to blame themselves for their shortcomings and failure to adapt to the realities of today&#8217;s economy. Their lives spiral downward as they cope with strained familial relationships, personal mental illness, and a society that has tossed them aside while simultaneously saying they are to blame for their own problems. Fascinatingly, Chen finds that these conditions and consequences mostly hold true for autoworkers in Canada, which is often lauded for its stronger and broader social safety net, as it does in the United States. With great empathy and astute analysis, Cut Loose shows the human side of economic transformations bereft of sound public policies and collectivist strategies<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0062390996/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Devoured: How What We Eat Defines Who We Are </a> (William Morrow Books, 2017), food writer and Culinary Institute of America program director Sophie Egan takes readers on an eye-opening journey through the American food psyche, examining the connections between the values that define our national character&#8212;work, freedom, and progress&#8212;and our eating habits, the good and the bad. Egan explores why these values make for such an unstable, and often unhealthy, food culture and, paradoxically, why they also make Americas cuisine so great.<br />
Egan raises a host of intriguing questions: Why does McDonalds have 107 items on its menu? Why are breakfast sandwiches, protein bars, and gluten-free anything so popular? Will bland, soulless meal replacements like Soylent revolutionize our definition of a meal? The search for answers takes her across the culinary landscape, from the prioritization of convenience over health to the unintended consequences of perks like free meals for employees; from the American obsession with having it our way to the surge of Starbucks, Chipotle, and other chains individualizing the eating experience; from high culture&#8212;artisan and organic and what exactly &#8220;natural&#8221; means&#8212;to low culture&#8212;the sale of 100 million Taco Bell Doritos Locos Tacos in ten weeks. She also looks at how America&#8217;s cuisine&#8212;like the nation itself&#8212;has been shaped by diverse influences from across the globe.<br />
Devoured weaves together insights from the fields of psychology, anthropology, food science, and behavioral economics as well as myriad examples from daily life to create a powerful and unique look at food in America.<br />

Converse Distinguished University Professor at the University of Michigan. Neither Liberal or Conservative looks straightly at what we have known in the past about ideology and the formation of ideology.<br />
Kalmoe and Kinder take up the seminal research of Phillip Converse on &#8220;ideological innocence.&#8221; What they find largely supports this historic finding that Americans are not that ideological. Several decades later, most of the country remains innocent of ideology. With the exception of some highly engaged and informed individuals, partisanship remains the central organizing feature of political life and identification for most Americans.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.lemoyne.edu/Learn/Our-Faculty/History/Leigh-Fought" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leigh Fought</a> is an assistant professor of history at Le Moyne College. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199782377/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women in the World of Frederick Douglass</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017) offers a detailed and rich portrait of Frederick Douglass&#8217; private and public life and his many relationships with women. From his enslaved mother Harriet, Sophia Auld the slave mistress that sparked his interest in reading, to his wife of forty-four years Anna Murray, daughter Rosetta and his white second wife Helen Pitts; these were the women who populated his private world. From each he learned lessons about the workings of race, gender and class in America and prepared him to collaborate with many antislavery women including Julia Griffiths, Maria Weston Chapman and Amy Post. He saw his fight for abolition as part of &#8220;woman&#8217;s cause&#8221; bringing him into contact with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Seeing himself as &#8220;woman&#8217;s rights man,&#8221; who had attended the Seneca Falls Woman&#8217;s Rights Convention in 1848, he was perplexed by the betrayal of many woman&#8217;s rights advocates. Fought fills in much of what is lacking in the female &#8220;empty space&#8221; in the study of Douglass allowing a fuller understanding of his life and ideas. This is an invaluable contribution to Douglass studies.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In her new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0825308437/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Playboy Laughs: The Comedy, Comedians, and Cartoons of Playboy</a> (Beaufort Books, 2017), <a href="http://patty-farmer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patty Farmer</a> examines the relationship between Hugh Hefner&#8217;s Playboy empire and some of the most influential comedians and cartoonists of the past 50 years. Farmer explores the ways in which the Playboy Clubs and Resorts of the 1960s and 1970s established spaces for comedians to hone their acts, get paid, and started the careers for many comedians and musicians. She looks at the savvy business decisions of Hefner that led to clubs which have influenced popular culture and society in a variety of ways. Farmer describes how establishing these clubs challenged racial barriers as desegregated comedy clubs in the 1960s as well as gender barriers, giving a performance space to many rising female comedians such as Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers. Farmer also looks at the role Playboy magazine played in launching the careers of many cartoonists such as Shel Silverstein and Al Jaffe and the meticulous attention to detail that Hefner paid to all cartoons and artists used throughout the magazine. Using interviews and oral histories, Farmer presents inside experiences from comedians and cartoonists who owe much of their career to Playboy magazine and Playboy Clubs.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469626756/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Texas: The Making of a Multiracial Democratic Coalition in the Civil Rights Era</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469626758/blue-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016) is about the &#8220;other&#8221; Texas, not the state known for its cowboy conservatism, but a mid-twentieth-century hotbed of community organizing, liberal politics, and civil rights activism. Beginning in the 1930s, the author tells the story of the decades-long struggle for democracy in Texas, when African American, Mexican American, and white labor and community activists gradually came together to empower the states marginalized minorities. At the ballot box and in the streets, these diverse activists demanded not only integration but economic justice, labor rights, and real political power for all. Their efforts gave rise to the Democratic Coalition of the 1960s, a militant, multiracial alliance that would take on and eventually overthrow both Jim Crow and Juan Crow.<br />
Using rare archival sources and original oral history interviews, historian <a href="https://professormax.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Krochmal </a>reveals the often-overlooked democratic foundations and liberal tradition of one of our nation&#8217;s most conservative states. Blue Texas recalls the many forgotten activists who, by crossing racial lines and building coalitions, democratized their cities and state to a degree that would have been unimaginable just a decade earlier and shows why their story still matters today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There are as many New Deals as there are books on the subject. Yet only recently have historians begun to dig into the international dimensions of the New Deal. <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.patel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiran Klaus Patel</a> is one of those historians, and his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691149127/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Deal: A Global History</a> (Princeton University Press, 2016), is an impressive crack at showing the transnational intertwinements and comparisons that made up the New Deal&#8217;s moment. Patel locates the United States in a vast network of modernizing states who experienced a shared crisis in the years after 1929, developed national policies to address the crisis, and looked to other states in search of inspiration or out of fear. As late as 1938, for instance, Roosevelt was requesting Nazi labor statistics to help refine his own administrations planning. Patel shows how the New Deal shaped the world and, more importantly, was shaped by the world.<br />
The book provides fresh contributions to a range of different topics, such as the global Great Depression, the Good Neighbor Policy, the development of the welfare state, interwar international relations, and American post-WWII globalism. Kiran Klaus Patel, Professor of European and Global History at Maastricht University, achieves this with a knowledge of secondary literature in a variety of languages and rich archival evidence. The result of Patel&#8217;s work is a New Deal that looks a lot less exceptional, yet no less important to global history.<br />

At the start of the war the newly-formed West Gulf squadron was faced with the task of patrolling hundreds of miles of coastline, from the Florida port of Pensacola to the Rio Grande River. Initially composed of just a handful of ships, the squadron would often spend months stationed off the coast, attempting to interdict the blockade runners that aided the Confederate war effort by bringing in the supplies the Confederates could not produce themselves. As the war went on the squadron took on the formidable task of capturing the major Confederate ports, and under the command of David Farragut it was instrumental to the capture of New Orleans and Mobile, as well as the occupation of the lower Mississippi River. It was through such efforts that the navy helped the Union win the war, and sooner than might otherwise have been possible.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In May, a tunnel filled with radioactive waste collapsed at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state, making international news. This incident highlighted the costs and challenges of cleaning up this deactivated nuclear facility, once America&#8217;s largest producer of plutonium for atomic weapons, including the Nagasaki bomb. The U.S. government spends around $2 billion a year on cleanup efforts at Hanford, which have been the sole focus at the site since its reactors were shut down at the end of the Cold War. Melvin R. Adams was one of the first environmental engineers hired at Hanford as part of a small team focused on environmental issues. Beginning in 1979, his 24-year career at Hanford progressed alongside increasing government investment in more responsible management of nuclear waste and its disposal. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0874223415/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomic Geography: A Personal History of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation</a> (Washington State University Press, 2016) Adams recounts engineering efforts to mitigate and control radioactive contamination and offers amusing anecdotes of the characters tasked with cleaning up the most contaminated nuclear waste site in the U.S. He also captures the paradox of Hanford, an artifact of the atomic age surrounded (and sometimes invaded by) wild terrain, natural beauty, and flourishing biodiversity. Atomic Geography offers personal and poetic insight into a complex, contested landscape.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.utk.edu/people/william-mercer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Davenport Mercer</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0806156023/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diminishing the Bill of Rights: Barron v. Baltimore and the Foundations of American Liberty</a> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2017) argues that if we want to understand how Americans in the early Republic viewed the sources of their rights, we need look no further than the mud at the bottom of Baltimore harbor. In the early nineteenth century, two men, John Barron, Jr. and John Craig, decided to buy a Baltimore wharf on credit. They were hoping to capitalize on rapidly-expanding commercial growth in city in the wake of the War of 1812. Instead, the city diverted water into the harbor, leaving Barron and Craig&#8217;s wharf silted up and the pair with a pile of debt. The men sued, and eventually their case was argued before the Supreme Court. The decision in Barron v. Baltimore, as William Davenport Mercer shows, marked a key development in the history of American constitutionalism. In arguing that the Bill of Rights (and thus, the Fifth Amendment) applied only at the Federal level, the court rejected a multi-sourced view of liberties. The contentious politics of the era, Dr. Mercer argues, precipitated our modern turn toward locating the sources of rights exclusively in documents. Dr. Mercer teaches history and law at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[This week on the podcast we have a true political science legend. <a href="http://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/david-mayhew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David R. Mayhew</a> is the author of such political science greats as Congress: The Electoral Connection, Divided We Govern, and Partisan Balance. He is the Sterling Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Yale University.<br />
In his recent book, Mayhew examines the job America&#8217;s most routinely disparaged branch of government has actually done? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300215703/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Imprint of Congress</a> (Yale University Press, 2017) gives a deep historical analysis of the U.S. Congress&#8217;s performance since the late eighteenth century. He tracks major policy challenges addressed by Congress. In the end, Mayhew argues that Congress has actually accomplished a lot and, in doing so, balanced the presidency in a surprising variety of ways. In the podcast, Mayhew also discusses our current debate on polarization and the early Trump administration.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What better way to explore the history of media regulation than to go on a journey with the former chief economist of the FCC? Prior to introduction of the Federal Radio Commission in 1927, the radio spectrum was in chaos. Broadcasters were attempting to drown out their rivals with powerful signals and the detrimental effect on the public interest was profound. Or was it?<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0300210507/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Political Spectrum: The Tumultuous Liberation of Wireless Technology, from Herbert Hoover to the Smartphone</a> (Yale University Press, 2017), distinguished legal and economic scholar <a href="https://www.thomashazlett.com/buy-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Hazlett</a> challenges the notion that U.S. government intervention was vital to protect and save the industry. Hazlett argues that, for nearly a century, disruptive technologies, competition and alternative viewpoints have been quashed, by special interest groups claiming to know better. Hazlett blends his discussion on legislation with the rise of new technologies in a way that in accessible to everyone, even if you have no prior knowledge of media policy and the current landscape. This entertaining and fascinating read argues that, if you really want to achieve what is best for the public, you need to open the market to more competition.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

As with other industrial cities throughout the Rust Belt, Lawrence encountered an urban crisis via the processes of deindustrialization, disinvestment, and suburbanization in the decades following World War II. During this period, the city also experienced a continuous influx of imperial migrants from Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Interweaving the narratives of urban crisis and Latina/o migration from the Caribbean, Barber examines the experience of Latinas/os in Lawrence through the lenses of imperialism, displacement, and exclusion. Whereas existent scholarship on the urban crisis has primarily focused on the 1960s and 1970s, Latino City pushes this discussion into the 1980s and 1990s, while also illuminating its effects on second tier cities like Lawrence. As she details the similarities and differences between African American and Latina/o experiences during the crisis era, Barber adeptly explains how Latinas/os revitalized Lawrence&#8217;s failing social, economic, and political institutions, and in the process, saved the city from the abandonment of white residents and capital.<br />

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107186994/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Afterlife of John Fitzgerald Kennedy: A Biography </a>(Cambridge University Press, 2017), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hogan_(academic)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael J. Hogan</a> describes how Kennedy came to enjoy such an enduring stature for so many Americans. He traces the origins of this to Kennedy&#8217;s efforts as president to create what Hogan terms a &#8220;Kennedy brand,&#8221; an image of charm, culture, and youthful optimism that appealed to millions of people. In this he was aided by his wife Jacqueline, who as first lady cultivated an aura of style and taste. With her husband&#8217;s death she quickly emerged as the foremost protector of his image by staging his funeral in such a way as to link him to his illustrious predecessors Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. This soon proved only the first of a series of memorials and publications generated in tribute to America&#8217;s 35th president, much of it supervised or controlled by the Kennedy family and their circle of friends. Their success in managing his public image is evident today in the esteem in which Kennedy continues to be held by so many people, even with the emergence of a more nuanced assessment of his time in office.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:subtitle>Mitchell Stephens‘s new book, The Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th Century Journalism (St. Martins Press, 2017), could be described, in part, as an entertaining book of stories about a legendary American storyteller. Stephens,</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://journalism.nyu.edu/about-us/profile/mitchell-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mitchell Stephens</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137279826/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Voice of America: Lowell Thomas and the Invention of 20th Century Journalism</a> (St. Martins Press, 2017), could be described, in part, as an entertaining book of stories about a legendary American storyteller.<br />
Stephens, professor of journalism at New York University, traces Lowell Thomas&#8217;s long career from his early days in the rough and tumble world of Chicago newspapers to his later fame as one of America&#8217;s earliest and longest-running radio newscasters and its first TV news host.<br />
Stephens tells how Thomas documented the First World War, weaving together photos, films and his own remarkable gift for oratory in multimedia presentations that he delivered live to two million people in theaters all over the world. It was Lowell Thomas who first reported the war exploits of Lawrence of Arabia, making both T.E. Lawrence and Thomas himself household names.<br />
As a journalism historian and author of the previous book, A History of News, Mitchell Stephens argues that Lowell Thomas helped invent the fact-based, authoritative and non-partisan style that characterized American journalism in the 20th century. In this interview with the New Books Network, Stephens talks about how Lowell Thomas forged a path as a broadcast celebrity that was later followed by his CBS colleague Edward R. Murrow and such TV anchors as Walter Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley and Tom Brokaw.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1479804924/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Islamophobia and Racism in America </a>(New York University Press, 2017), Sociologist <a href="http://eriklove.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erik Love</a> provides a historical and current snapshot of civil rights issues surrounding people from the &#8220;middle east&#8221; in America. Much like other racial and ethnic categorizations, Middle Eastern is a term that does not fit quite right and is also so broad it is vague, but the concept is used widely in the mainstream media and literature and so Love uses it here to help the reader connect to current events and the language used to talk about this particular demographic group. Love starts off by providing the reader with a clear understanding of the social construction of race and how we see and do not see race as tied to Islamophobia.<br />
Relying on sociological concepts and theory, Love uses historical information and examples from other racial groups to shine a light on the civil rights issues for people from the middle east in America, as well as those who are categorized as Middle Eastern even when they are not. The discussion in chapter three would be an excellent excerpt to use in any Sociology classroom to learn and talk more about the social construction of race. In his interview with advocates, Love learns about the strategies and history of these organizations and speaks about the struggles and successes they have had. Through the voices of the advocates, we learn more about the links between other civil rights issues and Islamophobia. This book is clearly written and provides the reader with a solid Sociological understanding of the issues surrounding race and Islamophobia in America. This book will be enjoyed by Sociologists broadly, but especially those studying Race, Ethnicity, or Religion, as well as Civil Rights advocates. This book would be well suited for a sociology of race or religion graduate course, especially at the beginning of the semester because it does a through and clear job of defining concepts and uses clear language to connect ideas.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://twitter.com/ellenwaylands?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen Wayland-Smith</a>, a descendent of the Oneida community, teaches writing at the University of Southern California. Her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1250043085/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oneida: From Free Love Utopia to the Well-set Table</a> (Picador Press, 2016) is an insightful and beautifully written history of the nineteenth-century Oneida community. Begun in 1848 by the religious visionary John Humphrey Noyes and his followers, Oneida became an experiment in biblical communism, complex marriage, gender equality, non-procreative sex and socialized child rearing as a symbol of universal fellowship. Noyes&#8217; practice of eugenics attempted to produce a generation of spiritual giants and created painful situations for those accused of &#8220;sticky love,&#8221; having preference for lovers and children. Internal conflicts, outside legal and social pressure brought its demise as an religious community in 1879. A remnant of entrepreneurial descendants built the secular Oneida Community Limited on new industrial and marketing methods. Rejecting the radical sexual ethics of their elders, the younger generation sought to provide a business model of brotherly love through innovative labor relations. The Oneida brand thrived in the America market place until its bankruptcy in 2006. The legacy of the Oneida community continues to fire the imagination for its alternative social arrangements and business innovation.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the inaugural podcast of Arguing History, historians <a href="http://neiberg102.wixsite.com/michael-neiberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael S. Neiberg</a> and <a href="http://www.history.army.mil/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Neumann</a> address the question of Americas decision in 1917 to declare war against Germany. Together they discuss the factors involved in it, such as Germanys wartime provocations and the economic impact the war was having upon the nation. Yet it was more than just a product of the events of the conflict, as it came at a time when the role of the United States in the world was being redefined by its emergence as a major economic and financial power on the international scene. How Americans perceived this also played a role both in the decision to go to war, even though there was no consensus as to how the nation should respond to the consequences of their choice once they made it.<br />
Michael S. Neiberg is the Stimson Chair of the Department of National Security and Strategy at the U.S. Army War College and the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/067472593X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dance of the Furies: Europe and the Outbreak of World War I</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014).

Gygax&#8217;s story and the tale of D and D&#8217;s genesis is ideally suited to the graphic novel format, and Kushner &#8212; who met and even gamed with Gygax &#8212; conveys these twin narratives well. Shadmi&#8217;s illustrations blend the mundane with the fantastical, and the striking cover art alone is sure to win Rise of the Dungeon Master a place on many comic collectors&#8217; shelves. I happily recommend it to anyone looking for a short overview of the subject, and certainly anyone with a love of both comic books and D and D.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1617756156/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In Search of the Lost Chord: 1967 and the Hippie Idea</a> (Akashic Books, 2017), <a href="http://goldve.com/danny-goldberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Danny Goldberg</a> explores the political, social, and cultural influences of 1967&#8211;a pivotal year in American history. Goldberg, who graduated from high school in 1967 and was influenced by the cultural of the1960s, presents a subjective history on what he sees as the legacy of 1967 fifty years later. In In Search of the Lost Chord, Goldberg examines not only the music scene of 1967, but the role of psychedelics, hippies, protest culture, Eastern religions and spirituality, politics, the Black Power movement, and activists such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Muhammad Ali, Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Cora Weiss, and Tom Hayden. Goldberg&#8217;s book is well researched and informed by interviews of some of the most influential participants during 1967, giving readers a greater understanding of the complexities of this influential time in American culture.<br />

They left in the middle of the night, often carrying little more than the knowledge to follow the North Star. Between 1830 and the end of the Civil War in 1865, an estimated one hundred thousand slaves became passengers on the Underground Railroad, a journey of untold hardship, in search of freedom. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1616895659/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Through Darkness to Light: Photographs Along the Underground Railroad</a> (<a href="https://www.papress.com/html/product.details.dna?isbn=9781616895655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Princeton Architectural Press</a>, 2017) presents a remarkable series of images following a route from the cotton plantations of central Louisiana, through the cypress swamps of Mississippi and the plains of Indiana, north to the Canadian border a path of nearly fourteen hundred miles.<br />
The culmination of a ten-year research quest, Through Darkness to Light imagines a journey along the Underground Railroad as it might have appeared to any freedom seeker. A person who explores her photography in this work may get the feeling they were actually there during this tumultuous time in American history. Framing the powerful visual narrative is an introduction by the author; a foreword by noted politician, pastor, and civil rights activist Andrew J. Young; and essays by noted historian Fergus M. Bordewich, journalism professor Robert F. Darden, and black studies scholar Eric R. Jackson.<br />
Author <a href="https://www.jmbalesphotography.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeanine Michna-Bales</a> is a Dallas-based photographer. Her work explores the relationships between what has occurred, or is occurring, in a society and how people react to those events. She meticulously researches each topic considering different viewpoints, causes, and effects and political climates and often incorporates found or archival text and audio into her projects. Images from her Underground Railroad series have been exhibited throughout the United States and have appeared in numerous online and print publications. Her next book-length work will focus on the images and architecture of Cold War era nuclear fallout shelters in the United States.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822363232/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Afro-Atlantic Flight: Speculative Returns and the Black Fantastic</a> (Duke University Press, 2017), <a href="https://english.utk.edu/people/michelle-commander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle D. Commander</a> examines the (im)possibility of literal and figurative returns to Africa of African-descended peoples throughout the diaspora. Using analysis inspired by &#8220;the ways in which the enslaved and their descendants took and have continued to take back control over their bodies&#8221;, and focusing on cultural production, Commander traces the points of intersection and divergence between the two modes of return, rather than dealing with them as mutually exclusive.<br />
