It's his mission to turn people away from their minds, and towards their true selves. </p><p>After working with thousands of people from the rich and the powerful, to orphans in the poor world, Philip is convinced that our struggles and depressions can be healed if we would just stop and listen to our intuition.</p><p>We live a life running away from our feelings, but the sad truth is, according to Philip, they catch up with us eventually. </p><p>The question is not what we think about money, relationships, family and work. The real question is how do they make us feel?</p><p>It’s the story behind those feelings that holds the key to living a more fulfilled life. But as Philip says, it’s that very story we are doing our best to avoid.</p><p>As he tells me in the course of our amazing discussion, when we give up trying to be who we think we should be, and allow ourselves to be who we really are, then we can start to build lasting happiness and self-worth. </p><p>For most of us, who we are is tied up in what we do, and that's what Philip is trying to steer us away from. </p><p>Can you define yourself outside the work you do? </p><p>Philip’s message is powerful, and he doesn’t waste words. This week’s interview is packed with ideas and practical advice on making the leap from what Philip calls ‘mindset’ to ‘soulset’.</p><p>Just listening to Philip Mckernan is gonna make you feel like you are doing serious and fulfilling inner work. </p><p>00:00 Trailer.</p><p>01:30 Brian’s Introduction.</p><p>05:16 Stop making the journey all about you, get in touch with what your gift is, use it to benefit others.</p><p>07:10 Philip’s own continuing journey and vision.</p><p>08:50 We lie to ourselves.</p><p>11:53 Living life intuitively not intellectually led.</p><p>13:29 The Best Man’s speech, causing carnage by how and what he said.</p><p>20:03 Moving self-belief from the head to an inner feeling of self-worth.</p><p>22:53 Lack of self-value inhibits everything.</p><p>25:20 An identity crisis, it is who you are, not what you do. Suppression of identity within relationships.</p><p>28:51 You can be incredibly lonely within your own skin.</p><p>29:57 Saddest thing is people not seeing their greatness and even sadder, not wanting to see it.</p><p>30:34 Giving your last talk before you die.</p><p>35:14 Never undervalue your story.

Krauss is an internationally known theoretical physicist with wide research interests, including the interface between elementary particle physics and cosmology, where his studies include the early universe, the nature of dark matter, general relativity and neutrino astrophysics. He has investigated questions ranging from the nature of exploding stars to issues of the origin of all mass in the universe. He was born in New York City and moved shortly thereafter to Toronto, Canada, where he grew up. He received undergraduate degrees in both Mathematics and Physics at Carleton University. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1982), then joined the Harvard Society of Fellows (1982-85). He joined the faculty of the departments of Physics and Astronomy at Yale University as assistant professor in 1985, and associate professor in 1988. In 1993 he was named the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, Professor of Astronomy, and Chairman of the department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University. He served in the latter position for 12 years, until 2005. During this period he built up the department, which was ranked among the top 20 Physics Graduate Research Programs in the country in a 2005 national ranking. </p><p>He has been involved for some time in issues of science and society and has helped spearhead national efforts to educate the public about science, ensure sound public policy , and defend science against attacks at a variety of levels. He has helped lead a national effort to defend the teaching of evolution in the public schools. His piece in the New York Times followed by a public letter to Pope Benedict helped to prompt a reevaluation of the Catholic Church's position on evolution. He led the creation of an organization in Ohio which recruited and supported pro-science candidates to run for State School Board against creationist candidates, and spoke out and wrote extensively during the election campaign. All candidates recruited by this group, Help Ohio Public Education, were elected, sometimes defeated candidates who outspent them by huge margins. In Dec 2007, he wrote in the Wall St. Journal proposing a Presidential Debate on Science, and serves on the steering committee of ScienceDebate2008. Their call for such a debate has now been cosponsored by the American Assoc. for the Advancement of Science and the Council on Competitiveness, as well as being endorsed by 20 Nobel Laureates, various Congresspeople, business leaders, and 12,000 scientists. In March 2008, Krauss and Richard Dawkins engaged in a public conversation at Stanford University on science and science education, and the video of their conversation and his video on the current state of cosmology presented at the AAI conference in October 2009 and produced by the Dawkins Foundation have become among most watched on Youtube since it appeared in April. In 2012, he was awarded the National Science Board's Public Service Medal.</p><p>Krauss is one of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture. For example, besides his radio and television work, Krauss has performed with the Cleveland Orchestra, narrating Gustav Holst's The Planets at the Blossom Music Center in the most highly attended concert at that venue, and was nominated for a Grammy award for his liner notes for a Telarc CD of music from Star Trek. In 2005 he also served as a jury member at the Sundance Film Festival.</p><p>In 2013, Krauss starred in a new full length feature film documentary called The Unbelievers, which follows Krauss and colleague Richard Dawkins around the world as they discuss science and reason.  The film had its world premiere at the Hot Docs International Film Festival in Toronto in April 2013. A number of celebrities including Woody Allen, Werner Herzog, Cameron Diaz, Ricky Gervais, Ian McEwan, Cormac McCarthy, Sarah Silverman and others appear in the film, for which Krauss was the executive producer.</p><p>Lawrence Krauss' website: http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/<br />Lawrence Krauss on Twitter: http://twitter.com/lkrauss1</p><p>BUILD THE BEST YOU:<br />http://londonrealacademy.com</p><p>TURN YOUR PASSION INTO A BUSINESS: <br />http://londonrealacademy.com/the-business-accelerator</p><p>SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE: <br />http://bit.ly/SubscribeToLondonReal</p><p>Music by 2pas0s - Vertov<br />https://www.facebook.com/2Pas0s<br />https://soundcloud.com/2pas0s</p>]]></description><author>Brian Rose</author><pubDate>Sat, 23 Apr 2016 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">df7b2f1e-d190-4f05-b795-ceca98a72f00</guid><itunes:author>Brian Rose</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Lawrence Krauss - A Godless UniverseFREE FULL EPISODE: http://londonrealacademy.com/episodesLawrence Maxwell Krauss is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona S</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Lawrence Krauss - A Godless Universe <br />FREE FULL EPISODE: http://londonrealacademy.com/episodes<br />Lawrence Maxwell Krauss is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, and director of its Origins Project.</p><p>Prof. Lawrence M.

He joined the faculty of the departments of Physics and Astronomy at Yale University as assistant professor in 1985, and associate professor in 1988. In 1993 he was named the Ambrose Swasey Professor of Physics, Professor of Astronomy, and Chairman of the department of Physics at Case Western Reserve University. He served in the latter position for 12 years, until 2005. During this period he built up the department, which was ranked among the top 20 Physics Graduate Research Programs in the country in a 2005 national ranking. </p><p>He has been involved for some time in issues of science and society and has helped spearhead national efforts to educate the public about science, ensure sound public policy , and defend science against attacks at a variety of levels. He has helped lead a national effort to defend the teaching of evolution in the public schools. His piece in the New York Times followed by a public letter to Pope Benedict helped to prompt a reevaluation of the Catholic Church's position on evolution. He led the creation of an organization in Ohio which recruited and supported pro-science candidates to run for State School Board against creationist candidates, and spoke out and wrote extensively during the election campaign. All candidates recruited by this group, Help Ohio Public Education, were elected, sometimes defeated candidates who outspent them by huge margins. In Dec 2007, he wrote in the Wall St. Journal proposing a Presidential Debate on Science, and serves on the steering committee of ScienceDebate2008. Their call for such a debate has now been cosponsored by the American Assoc. for the Advancement of Science and the Council on Competitiveness, as well as being endorsed by 20 Nobel Laureates, various Congresspeople, business leaders, and 12,000 scientists. In March 2008, Krauss and Richard Dawkins engaged in a public conversation at Stanford University on science and science education, and the video of their conversation and his video on the current state of cosmology presented at the AAI conference in October 2009 and produced by the Dawkins Foundation have become among most watched on Youtube since it appeared in April. In 2012, he was awarded the National Science Board's Public Service Medal.</p><p>Krauss is one of the few prominent scientists today to have actively crossed the chasm between science and popular culture. For example, besides his radio and television work, Krauss has performed with the Cleveland Orchestra, narrating Gustav Holst's The Planets at the Blossom Music Center in the most highly attended concert at that venue, and was nominated for a Grammy award for his liner notes for a Telarc CD of music from Star Trek. In 2005 he also served as a jury member at the Sundance Film Festival.</p><p>In 2013, Krauss starred in a new full length feature film documentary called The Unbelievers, which follows Krauss and colleague Richard Dawkins around the world as they discuss science and reason.  The film had its world premiere at the Hot Docs International Film Festival in Toronto in April 2013. A number of celebrities including Woody Allen, Werner Herzog, Cameron Diaz, Ricky Gervais, Ian McEwan, Cormac McCarthy, Sarah Silverman and others appear in the film, for which Krauss was the executive producer.</p><p>Lawrence Krauss' website: http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/<br />Lawrence Krauss on Twitter: http://twitter.com/lkrauss1</p><p>BUILD THE BEST YOU:<br />http://londonrealacademy.com</p><p>TURN YOUR PASSION INTO A BUSINESS: <br />http://londonrealacademy.com/the-business-accelerator</p><p>SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE: <br />http://bit.ly/SubscribeToLondonReal</p><p>Music by 2pas0s - Vertov<br />https://www.facebook.com/2Pas0s<br />https://soundcloud.com/2pas0s</p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>1:27:58</itunes:duration><link>http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0363-lawrence-krauss-a-godless-universe-18628.mp3</link><enclosure length="84998190" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0363-lawrence-krauss-a-godless-universe-18628.mp3" /><media:content length="84998190" medium="audio" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0363-lawrence-krauss-a-godless-universe-18628.mp3" /></item><item><title>Lawrence Krauss - A Godless Universe - TRAILER</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Lawrence Maxwell Krauss is an American theoretical physicist and cosmologist who is Foundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, and director of its Origins Project. </p><p><span style="font-size:1em;

An engineer and former Royal Canadian Air Force fighter pilot, Chris Hadfield has flown two space shuttle missions and served as commander of the International Space Station.</p><p>Chris, who was raised on a farm in southern Ontario, was inspired as a child when he watched the Apollo 11 Moon landing on TV. He attended high school in Oakville and Milton and earned his glider pilot licence as a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. He joined the Canadian Armed Forces and earned an engineering degree at Royal Military College. While in the military he learned to fly various types of aircraft and eventually became a test pilot and flew several experimental planes. As part of an exchange program with the United States Navy and United States Air Force, he obtained a master's degree in aviation systems at the University of Tennessee Space Institute.</p><p>In 1992, he was accepted into the Canadian astronaut program by the Canadian Space Agency. He first flew in space aboard STS-74 in November 1995 as a mission specialist. During the mission he visited the Russian space station Mir. In April 2001 he flew again on STS-100 and visited the International Space Station (ISS), where he walked in space and helped to install the Canadarm2. In December 2012 he flew for a third time aboard Soyuz TMA-07M and joined Expedition 34 on the ISS. He was a member of this expedition until March 2013 when he became the commander of the ISS as part of Expedition 35. He was responsible for a crew of five astronauts and helped to run dozens of scientific experiments dealing with the impact of low gravity on human biology. During the mission he also gained popularity by chronicling life aboard the space station and taking pictures of the earth and posting them through Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and Tumblr to a large following of people around the world. He was a guest on television news and talk shows and gained popularity by playing the International Space Station's guitar in space. His mission ended in May 2013 when he returned to earth. Shortly after returning, he announced his retirement, capping a 35-year career as a military pilot and an astronaut.</p><p>Chris Hadfield's website: http://chrishadfield.ca/<br />Chris Hadfield on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield </p><p>SUBSCRIBE ON YOUTUBE: <br />http://bit.ly/SubscribeToLondonReal</p><p>LONDON REAL TV: <br />http://www.londonreal.tv</p><p>MUSIC: <br />A revised version of David Bowie's Space Oddity, recorded by Commander Chris Hadfield on board the International Space Station.<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo</p><p>Composition: “SPACE ODDITY”<br />Written by David Bowie<br />Published by Onward Music Limited</p><p>From the album “Space Sessions: Songs From a Tin Can.” Available everywhere now.<br />CD/LP: http://www.smarturl.it/SpaceSessionsPhys<br />Download: http://www.smarturl.it/SpaceSessionsDL<br />Stream: http://www.smarturl.it/SpaceSesionsStrm</p><p>David Bowie's Original Space Oddity:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYMCLz5PQVw</p>]]></description><author>Brian Rose</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">61dc25e4-02c4-44de-8133-53f7faea59c6</guid><itunes:author>Brian Rose</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Chris Hadfield - Lessons From An Astronaut - Part 1 of 2.FREE FULL EPISODE: http://londonrealacademy.com/episodes/Chris Hadfield is a retired Canadian astronaut who was the first Canadian to walk in space.

Collectively his five TED talks on various aspects of sound and communication have been viewed an estimated 20 million times. His latest talk, How to speak so that people want to listen, is in the rare group that has over 9 million views on TED.com alone, putting it in the top 25 TED talks of all time.</p><p>Julian’s book Sound Business is the seminal work on creating intentional, effective business sound, now in its second edition and also published in Japanese. He has been widely featured as a sound and communication expert in the world’s media, including TIME Magazine; The Economist; The Times; TV and radio in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and Netherlands, as well as many international trade and business magazines and websites.</p><p>Julian is founder and chairman of The Sound Agency, a UK-based consultancy that asks and answers the question: “How does your brand sound?”. TSA helps clients such as Harrods, Nokia, BP, Marks &amp; Spencer, Helm Bank (Colombia), Waldorf Astoria and many major shopping malls across Europe to grow their business by optimising the sounds they make. The agency specialises in creating effective and appropriate organic soundscapes for branded spaces.</p><p>Julian now draws on his 10 years of experience in optimising sound for brands to deliver memorable and transformative keynotes and workshops on personal communication and sound branding. His topics include: the hidden effects of sound and noise on us all; how to improve your conscious listening; how to master powerful speaking (including public speaking); how to optimise sound for a brand or business; and how to design sound environments for health, productivity and better relationships. His talks can transform business communication effectiveness, yet they also profoundly engage audiences at a personal level. The innovative use of sound in his talks makes them visceral and potent experiences that are always very highly rated by delegates.</p><p>Julian’s vision is to make the world sound beautiful, by helping individuals to make and receive sound consciously, and companies to discover that good sound is good business – which is fortunately true, as The Sound Agency has shown. TSA has installed innovative generative soundscapes in Harrods’ new Toy Kingdom (winning the Gold Audio Branding Award in 2012 for this work), made the front page of the Wall Street Journal with a crime-reducing urban soundscape in Lancaster, California, and has proved that sound can increase retail sales, customer satisfaction and brand value.

Collectively his five TED talks on various aspects of sound and communication have been viewed an estimated 20 million times. His latest talk, How to speak so that people want to listen, is in the rare group that has over 9 million views on TED.com alone, putting it in the top 25 TED talks of all time.</p><p>Julian’s book Sound Business is the seminal work on creating intentional, effective business sound, now in its second edition and also published in Japanese. He has been widely featured as a sound and communication expert in the world’s media, including TIME Magazine; The Economist; The Times; TV and radio in the UK, US, Canada, Australia and Netherlands, as well as many international trade and business magazines and websites.</p><p>Julian is founder and chairman of The Sound Agency, a UK-based consultancy that asks and answers the question: “How does your brand sound?”. TSA helps clients such as Harrods, Nokia, BP, Marks &amp; Spencer, Helm Bank (Colombia), Waldorf Astoria and many major shopping malls across Europe to grow their business by optimising the sounds they make. The agency specialises in creating effective and appropriate organic soundscapes for branded spaces.</p><p>Julian now draws on his 10 years of experience in optimising sound for brands to deliver memorable and transformative keynotes and workshops on personal communication and sound branding. His topics include: the hidden effects of sound and noise on us all; how to improve your conscious listening; how to master powerful speaking (including public speaking); how to optimise sound for a brand or business; and how to design sound environments for health, productivity and better relationships. His talks can transform business communication effectiveness, yet they also profoundly engage audiences at a personal level. The innovative use of sound in his talks makes them visceral and potent experiences that are always very highly rated by delegates.</p><p>Julian’s vision is to make the world sound beautiful, by helping individuals to make and receive sound consciously, and companies to discover that good sound is good business – which is fortunately true, as The Sound Agency has shown. TSA has installed innovative generative soundscapes in Harrods’ new Toy Kingdom (winning the Gold Audio Branding Award in 2012 for this work), made the front page of the Wall Street Journal with a crime-reducing urban soundscape in Lancaster, California, and has proved that sound can increase retail sales, customer satisfaction and brand value.

If we are willing to take a jab for polio, to embrace medical science for every-day diseases, then the logic, for Istvan, is no different. In his words it’s ‘common sense’.</p><p>So where’s the line?

What could appear as an erratic career path has seen him work as a performing magician, travel agent and even vitamin salesman. It was in the 80s, though, that David developed his model for increasing productivity and efficiency, one that can be applied on personal and corporate scales. Since then he’s become a leading thinker and author in the field, publishing the bestseller ‘Getting Things Done’ in 2001.</p><p>David has also invested and founded other businesses, such as Auctioneer and the David Allen Company.

Aside from being an internationally known management consultant and bestselling writer, David Allen has a keen interest in transcendental meditation and the importance of spiritual practices.</p><p>In the flurry that is the modern business world, David Allen’s methods have never been more popular or relevant. For those that struggle to bring order to their day or simply find it difficult to get things done, this episode is packed with essential wisdom.

It was in the 80s, though, that David developed his model for increasing productivity and efficiency, one that can be applied on personal and corporate scales.

If your first thought is “not me” then get your ass on Youtube and have a look at the hundreds of talks already there.

Find a place that will host you. </p><p> </p><p><strong>1. Throw your hat over the fence. </strong>Book yourself on the TED train and make it real. Setting things in motion will be the first step in a journey that will reward you on a thousand levels. Overcome the fear and step up.</p><p><strong>2. Craft your speech.</strong> Craft is the word. No great peace of writing, art or music dropped first time. Same stands for oration. Writing is rewriting - put the work in on the page. Preparation is more than just writing though. Practice in front of a camera but more importantly practice in front of real people. The greatest stand up comedians spend many shows refining wording that works differently on stage than on the page. Putting in the hard hours will set you apart on the day - your audience will know the difference.</p><p><strong>3. Eyes on you, not the Keynote. </strong>Less is more when it comes to visuals - your presentation should add to the story, not tell the story. People are turning up for the live experience not a commentated slide show. Guy Kawasaki recommends 10 slides for every 30 minutes of speaking…</p><p><strong>4. Get your own people there.</strong> Supporters in the crowd will pump your confidence and boost your hype. It’s about more than this though. When the people you know are there, you’ll throw it up a gear and work harder to perfect the speech. Strangers you can walk away from, fans and colleagues - not so easy. Align those cognitive bias, condition the environment so that you up your game.</p><p><strong>5. The journey continues when you walk back off stage. </strong>That’s right, it’s not completely about the talk. The video gets forgotten or lands out there in cyberspace. The question that will remain is what did you take away from the experience. Answer: personal growth and quantifiable evolution. You’ll have tested yourself in an enormous amount of ways. The philosophy at the very heart of London Real.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not about the video or the audience listening, it’s about the challenge of making it happen. It will change you. Do it - no half measures.</p>]]></description><author>Brian Rose</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">46dd49ab-7b21-47a0-935c-37c0ce2618e2</guid><itunes:author>Brian Rose</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Everyone has a TED talk in them.

Get your own people there.</strong> Supporters in the crowd will pump your confidence and boost your hype. It’s about more than this though. When the people you know are there, you’ll throw it up a gear and work harder to perfect the speech. Strangers you can walk away from, fans and colleagues - not so easy. Align those cognitive bias, condition the environment so that you up your game.</p><p><strong>5. The journey continues when you walk back off stage. </strong>That’s right, it’s not completely about the talk. The video gets forgotten or lands out there in cyberspace. The question that will remain is what did you take away from the experience. Answer: personal growth and quantifiable evolution. You’ll have tested yourself in an enormous amount of ways. The philosophy at the very heart of London Real.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not about the video or the audience listening, it’s about the challenge of making it happen. It will change you. Do it - no half measures.</p>]]></itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>no</itunes:explicit><itunes:duration>0:12:38</itunes:duration><link>http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0183-how-i-aced-my-ted-talk-why-you-will-too-6087.mp3</link><enclosure length="12592096" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0183-how-i-aced-my-ted-talk-why-you-will-too-6087.mp3" /><media:content length="12592096" medium="audio" type="audio/mpeg" url="http://shoutengine.com/LondonReal/LondonReal-0183-how-i-aced-my-ted-talk-why-you-will-too-6087.mp3" /></item><item><title>Steven Pinker - Too Much Morality REDUX</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Only this weekend Mr Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, announced in his new book club ‘A Year of Books’ that he’d be taking on Stephen Pinker’s ‘The Better Angel’s of Our Nature’.

Man</title><description><![CDATA[<p>As the high speed train wound its way up the English coast and onto the seas of Scotland I passed the hours by studying the man whom I would soon meet again, Dan Peña.  I perused his full dossier:  biography, newsletters, videos, and speeches looking for something that would tell me more about the man that I could not yet fully understand.  But was I studying my enemy or my future mentor?Six months earlier I had the dubious honour of welcoming the "50 Billion Dollar Man" into my studio in Shoreditch in East London for a two hour interview where I was both

again, Dan Peña.  I perused his full dossier:  biography, newsletters, videos, and speeches looking for something that would tell me more about the man that I could not yet fully understand.  But was I studying my enemy or my future mentor?Six months earlier I had the dubious honour of welcoming the "50 Billion Dollar Man" into my studio in Shoreditch in East London for a two hour interview where I was both repulsed and fascinated by his many accomplishments and accolades.  I declared on camera that the London Realers would either "Love him or Hate him" and the subsequent 50,000 views racked
