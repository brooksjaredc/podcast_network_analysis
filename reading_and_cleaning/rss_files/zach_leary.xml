Not much that hasn't been said before however, since this episode was recorded for the MAPS show it's focus is primarily on psychedelics.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The first episode of 2018 whirls in with pagan wisdom and Goddess power of Amanda Yates Garcia otherwise known as "The Oracle of Los Angeles." Amanda is a witch by birth, profession and soul. She's out to bring light, healing and knowledge to all those that seek her expertise. We did this podcast in person at the kitchen table and I'll confirm that her force field is powerful, seductive and extremely thought provoking. Our conversation dove into many mystical nooks and crannies surrounding the world today coupled with practical witchy suggestions for applying magic into ones own life. Amanda's perspective into how society and consciousness fuse together with the elements of the physical world is truly remarkable. I learned so much from this one, there must be a part 2 someday. If you're at all curious about how a modern day witch operates and thrives in today's world look no further.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - New Year, New Everything</p> <p><strong>Amanda Yates Garcia -</strong> Growing up in a pagan household my magical education started young; I learned to read the tarot and made my own set of runes before I entered my teens; my great grandmother read palms and tea leaves, and I share the same family tree as <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a>.</p> <p>Today I draw from a broad range of esoteric strategies including the Western Mystery Traditions of tarot, alchemy and Hermeticism; shamanic healing practices; positive magic and witchcraft; herbalism; energy work (Reiki, tantra and other yogas); psychomagic and more.</p> <p>Throughout my years as a magical practitioner, I’ve given countless tarot readings; spent months at Zen monasteries; given lectures on <a href= "http://esmoa.org/program/real-world-witch-an-evening-with-amanda-yates-garcia-oracle-of-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Witchcraft at ESMOA,</a> UC Irvine, Cal State Pomona and UCLA; received my Reiki Master initiation from Tibetan monk Tenzin Lama Sherpa; studied Holotropic Breathwork with Michael Stone and have received a certification in breathwork by David Elliott; and trained in shamanic healing techniques with Amanda Foulger of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. I also have a BFA in Dance Theatre from University College of London, and an MFA in Writing/Critical Theory and Film/Video from California Institute of the Arts.</p>]]></description>

If you're at all curious about how a modern day witch operates and thrives in today's world look no further.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - New Year, New Everything</p> <p>Amanda Yates Garcia - Growing up in a pagan household my magical education started young; I learned to read the tarot and made my own set of runes before I entered my teens; my great grandmother read palms and tea leaves, and I share the same family tree as <a href= "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a>.</p> <p>Today I draw from a broad range of esoteric strategies including the Western Mystery Traditions of tarot, alchemy and Hermeticism; shamanic healing practices; positive magic and witchcraft; herbalism; energy work (Reiki, tantra and other yogas); psychomagic and more.</p> <p>Throughout my years as a magical practitioner, I’ve given countless tarot readings; spent months at Zen monasteries; given lectures on <a href= "http://esmoa.org/program/real-world-witch-an-evening-with-amanda-yates-garcia-oracle-of-los-angeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Witchcraft at ESMOA,</a> UC Irvine, Cal State Pomona and UCLA; received my Reiki Master initiation from Tibetan monk Tenzin Lama Sherpa; studied Holotropic Breathwork with Michael Stone and have received a certification in breathwork by David Elliott; and trained in shamanic healing techniques with Amanda Foulger of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies. I also have a BFA in Dance Theatre from University College of London, and an MFA in Writing/Critical Theory and Film/Video from California Institute of the Arts.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing quite like tripping the light fantastic with David Silver. Episode 110 of the podcast brings David back to the show in the form of an exploration into our world today that only David can present. Our talk did dance in the political arena for a bit solely out of the desire to examine the surrealist schism that it is. We also talked about the passing of Siddhi Ma, our changing relationship with media, the success of the 60's, the protest movement and rock and roll. David is one of the finest minds on the planet today. Enjoy.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - Remembering Siddhi Ma</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href= "https://www.etsy.com/shop/bellesantebeauty">Belle Sante Beauty</a></p> <p><strong>David Silver</strong> started his innovative media career in the late sixties hosting WGBH-TV’s “What’s Happening Mr. Silver?” David’s 1979 Warner Brothers feature “No Nukes” helped start the whole trend of music/activism feature documentaries.</p> <p>He also wrote the Billboard #1 MGM film, “The Compleat Beatles” the biopic movie of choice about history’s most famous band. David has worked with Bruce Springsteen, Bob Marley, Ringo Starr, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Roger Waters and many others. He has created dozens of CD’s and movies, including pairing Allen Ginsberg with Paul McCartney, and producing the film biography of Timothy Leary. In 2009, David was the consultant to Ang Lee, the Academy Award-winning director, on his Universal/Focus Features release, “Taking Woodstock.” Since 2006, he has also been writing, directing and consulting with Ram Dass’s Love Serve Remember Foundation and, in 2012, directed the “Cultivating Loving Awareness” documentary.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For 50 years Bruce Margolin has been leading the charge for the reform of marijuana laws in California through this law practice and policy stewardship. To say he is a legend in the world of counter culture criminal defense law is an understatement. He is truly one of the great personalities, thinkers and leaders of our time. Our conversation covered so much of the rich tapestry of his life, journey, the state of cannabis laws and a very special detour. That detour comes in the form of this: in 1972 Bruce was the attorney for Tim Leary in his prison escape case. The time he spent with Timothy and the stories he tells are essential in forming a complete picture of the Leary saga. You can't make this stuff up. Tune into this episode to go on a journey into one of the most fascinating lives and front row seats that you'll ever come across.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - Net Neutrality</p> <p>This episode is sponsored by <a href= "https://www.etsy.com/shop/bellesantebeauty">Belle Sante Beauty</a></p> <p><strong>Bruce M. Margolin</strong> has over 40 years experience in defending the rights of his clients. He is equally as passionate at working to reform laws he believes to be unjust.

Because of all the recent ugly examples that have bubbled up in America lately I wanted to dicsect the issue from a solution oriented perspective but also from a place that identifies the root level issue and not the superficial one. DJ's intelligence, rational objectivity, education and passion was able to guide me through a landscape that I know only so little about.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Neal Goldsmith beams into the kitchen table via the wonders of cyberspace to discuss his exhaustively evolved perspective on the psychedelic experience. Neal's background as a psychotherapist provides a unique perspective into the individuals relationship with the psychedelic journey and how it can alter your life in a constructive and healthy way. Our conversation surfed the many angles of his thinking in particular a breakdown of "psychospiritual development and resistance to change." For me, the juxtaposition of mysticism, psychology and spirituality into a uniformed discussion is one that few people can speak eloquently on - Neal is at the top of this list. Enjoy the podcast!</p> <p>Intro Rant - The Importance of Hugh Hefner</p> <p><strong>Neal M. Goldsmith, Ph.D.</strong> is a psychotherapist specializing in psychospiritual development and resistance to change.  Seeing “neurosis” as the natural unfolding of human maturation, he views psychology as the science of personal emergence and spiritual maturity.  With the exception of biologically-based diseases, such as schizophrenia, psychology is not about “mental illness” and so Dr. Goldsmith treats “neurosis” as spiritual immaturity, not pathology.  In fact, he believes the “sick” label itself tightens and distorts, actually slowing healthy realignment.</p> <p>Neal is also the founder of the Horizons: Perspectives on Psychedelics conference in NYC which is coming up on Oct 6-8. <a href="http://www.horizonsnyc.org">Click here to buy tickets </a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 102 of the It's All Happening podcast features the divine creatrix behind PhenoVibe, Ariane Labyrinth. Ariane is a dear friend and soul sister, we recorded the episode in the quiet vibey confines of the post midnight witching hour. Yes, Ariane and her <a href="http://phenovibe.com/events/?v=f24485ae434a">next Cosmic Cabaret event (Rites of Passage)  </a>goes down on September 29th but our conversation had very little do with that. We surfed the sonic sugary frequencies of metaphysical practice, energy, light space and a whole host of psychedelic sacredness that's almost impossible to talk about, but we did! This episode is not like any other that IAH has done, I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p><strong>Ariane Labyrinth - </strong>is the chief creatrix and inspiration behind PhenoVIbe. The focus of our practice is Cosmic Alchemy, a unique type of experience allowing us to directly connect to and immerse ourselves in source energy and light -the most empowering and transformative force of the universe. Her roots are in dance, metaphysical meditation and light work.</p> <p><a href="http://phenovibe.com/events/?v=f24485ae434a">CLICK HERE for tickets to Rites of Passage on September 29th</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>On August 2, 2017, Gary Baum of the Hollywood Reporter published what is now <a href= "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/angelyne-la-billboard-diva-30-years-1025678"> a legendary piece</a> on the real identity of LA cult icon Angelyne. It was so spell binding that nearly everyone in LA who is over a certain age participated in the chatter of what it all meant. I was so blown away that I had to track Gary down to see if he would do the podcast. Sure enough he was most gracious and sat down with me at The Hollywood Reporter office. For about an hour we discussed all the ins and outs and what-have-yous surrounding the development of the article and it's whodunit caper qualities. Two years prior, Gary wrote another article on the enduring legend of Angelyne and began to chip away at her razor sharp fabricated image. He's spent a lot of face time with Angelyne and has a wonderfully curious point of view on the deeper meaning behind not just her but also on the nature of reinvention, identity and life in the modern media-sphere. This is episode 101 of the It's All Happening podcast. I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p><strong>Gary Baum</strong> is a Senior writer at The Hollywood Reporter, covering the circus.</p> <p>@garymbaum</p> <p><img style= "display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src= "https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/69688/101_baum.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="266" /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>EPISODE 100 of the It's All Happening Podcast!!! Amazing. To celebrate this milestone I brought back two return guests to the fold - Taryn Southern and Jack Kornfield. Taryn is the main guest and takes us on a wonderfully informative and inspirational journey into the emerging worlds of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. Taryn just <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUs6CznN8pw">released a new single</a> that has AI as her band! And of course, Jack Kornfield's heartfelt wisdom grounds us in a dharma talk centered around making friends with our practice in these complex times. This episode truly embodies my passions of bringing technology and spirituality into one conversation.</p> <p>I am beyond moved, grateful and blown away that 100 episodes has been reached. It seemed so far away! With the love and support of you guys we'll certainly have 100 more! Thank you everyone who's been riding along with me on the adventure these past two years. You've taught me more than you'll ever know.</p> <p><strong>Taryn Southern</strong> - I love to make stuff online. Here’s some music stuff. Some comedy stuff. Some VR stuff. Some TV and filmstuff. I’m the founder of Happy Cat Media, which has produced 1500+ videos for brands like Marriott, MovieTickets, and Today Show, and is now focused on immersive storytelling and consulting. My hobbies include adventure travel, margaritas, and irreverent comedy.</p> <p><a href= "http://tarynsouthern.com">http://tarynsouthern.com</a></p> <p><strong>Jack Kornfield</strong> - Jack Kornfield trained as a Buddhist monk in the monasteries of Thailand, India and Burma. He has taught meditation internationally since 1974 and is one of the key teachers to introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to the West. After graduating from Dartmouth College in Asian Studies in 1967 he joined the Peace Corps and worked on tropical medicine teams in the Mekong River valley. He met and studied as a monk under the Buddhist master Ven. Ajahn Chah, as well as the Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Episode 98 of the It's All Happening with Zach Leary podcast features the lightening rod that is Amarna Miller. For quite awhile I've been wanting to do have an adult film star on the podcast with the hopes of being able to dig into the controversy and philosophy around sexuality in America. Amarna is very bright and articulate and you'll see that the talk covered a wide variety of topics including her experience doing what she does, healthy sexuality around the world, why there is so much controversy on the issue, gender roles and feminism. I know this podcast will be a turn off for some and might strike a chord. My intention was to have a level headed reasonably non biased look into the topic. Like it or not it's a huge part of our culture and dialogue around it is a good thing.</p> <p class="font_9"><strong>Amarna Miller</strong> is porn actress and director, entrepreneur and graduated in Fine Arts. I am 24, bisexual and I love sex in all its forms, I consider it something natural that should not be hidden. I like BDSM, antique things, photography and art. And I just won the Ninfa award for best actress of the year! My life is based in travel around the world shooting for different producers. In this blog I will write my experiences, the ideas that I have, and also I'll post videos and exclusive photo shoots. I hope that by this way you could know me a little more</p> <p>www.amarnamiller.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The IAH podcast returns with Episode 97! This one features the bhakti-infused heart of financial wizard, Jason Rotman. I wanted Jason on the podcast for awhile because I know of so few people who embody consciously infused capitalism in such an inspiring way. He lives in both the material world and the spiritual world with grace and ease. By day he's a trading expert/analyst while also being a kirtan wallah, poet and lover of bliss.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The IAH podcast returns with Episode 97! This one features the bhakti-infused heart of financial wizard, Jason Rotman. I wanted Jason on the podcast for awhile because I know of so few people who embody consciously infused capitalism in such an inspiring way. He lives in both the material world and the spiritual world with grace and ease. By day he's a trading expert/analyst while also being a kirtan wallah, poet and lover of bliss.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This all new episode of the IAH podcast features the wise, smart and razor sharp funny local LA comedian, Vanessa Johnston. I ran into Vanessa after scouring the scorched earth of the Internet looking for comedians to come and brighten up the fabric of the podcast. Vanessa was good enough to come by to talk about her roots in comedy, her youth in Minnesota, making fun of my tulsi beads and why her first goal in life was to be president of the US. I really enjoyed this one!</p> <p>Vanessa Johnston is a Los Angeles based stand-up comedian originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota. She has been featured as a regular on Kill Tony at the Comedy Store Hollywood - the number one live comedy podcast in the world - where she wrote and performed a new minute of standup every week for 60 weeks straight. Vanessa performs at some of LA's favorite clubs, including The Comedy Store, The Ice House, and The Improv. She made her TV debut on Emmy-award winning sitcom How I Met Your Mother. In 2014, she starred in Netflix movie Jurassic City. Johnston has written and performed skits for talk shows such as The Doctors on CBS.</p> <p>www.vanessajohnston.com</p>]]></description>

Ani spent years as a public school teacher mainly focussing on special needs students and her experience into the system, the children and how our society is broken in this area made for a fascinating podcast. We talked about that, the future of public schools and new models for education. We also shifted the talk to sex ed and why we need to stop calling people stupid because "Donald Trump is a genius!"</p> <p>Ani Easton Baker - For twelve years I worked as a teacher, credentialed to work with primary grade students who have mild-moderate disabilities, which taught me most of the most important things about being alive. Last year, four years after being granted tenure, I took a leap and a leave of absence to make my <em>first</em> documentary film about the public education system, a system I have a lot of feelings and input about. I am beyond fortunate to have earned the support of VeryApe productions in New York, a company run by my absolute favorite documentary filmmaker of all time, Sean Dunne. With his support and the support of a small team of filmmakers in Los Angeles, I am making this long-held desire a tangible entity that exists in the world.</p> <p>www.anieastonbaker.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Govind Das returns to the podcast for Episode 90! We talk a lot about the path of yoga and it's integration from the mat into the world. So much happens within ones personal practice that we must learn how to take those experiences and incorporate them into our daily lives. The podcast also covers our current state of collective confusion and what can be done about that, raising yogi children in LA, living from the non-ego state and living ones dharma. Week in and week out, Govind Das is one of the pre-eminent yogis who is living in a world beyond just teaching - it's as if you are watching someone living their purpose and experiencing a total surrender right before your very eyes.</p> <p>Of course this episode also talks about the loss and impact of the great Chris Cornell.</p> <p>This is episode is brought to you by Siddhi Herbals - the best in CBD Technology. <a href="http://www.siddhiherbals.com">Visit their site for more info</a>.</p> <p><strong>Govind Das</strong> (Ira Jeffrey Rosen) first came to yoga while living in Los Angeles in 1994 because of health concerns- specifically ulcerative colitis/crohn's/inflammatory bowel disease... After years of many different practices with the intention of healing(hatha yoga, ayurveda, buddhist meditation etc), Ira Rosen found his yogic "home' in the path of Bhakti Yoga... the aspect of yoga frequently described as the "yoga of the heart" or "the yoga of love and devotion". Not by avoiding or denying our life and health challenges, but only by accepting and courageously moving through and forward, the flower of our full appreciation and devotion to Life blooms.</p> <p><a href= "http://www.bhaktiyogashala.com">www.bhaktiyogashala.com</a></p>]]></description>

This is a dual podcast swap with <a href="http://mapspodcast.libsyn.com">The MAPS Podcast</a> and features Shane Mauss, Lex Pelger and Berra Yazar-Klosinski. It was recorded live as a panel format and took place at the very tail end of the Psychedelic Science conference in Oakland, CA. Because it was the end of the conference we collectively reminisced and riffed in a loose, funny and free conversational feel about where psychedelic research is headed. We also spoke of our culture outside of our own echo chamber and how the rest of America is keeping up. I was so honored that these guys spent some time with me on stage and it took a lot for me to keep up with their brilliance and accomplishments. The intro was recorded live in India about two hours after the one-two punch of darshan at Kaishi-Vishwanath and the burning ghats of Varanasi. If you don't know what that means have a listen then book a plane flight.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There are many great stories of the Eastern spiritual renaissance taking hold in the West. There's Richard Alpert to Ram Dass, Yogananda's revolution in Los Angeles, Swami Vivekananda bringing Vedanta to the States. And then there's the story of Srila Prabhuphad and the Hare Krishna movement. It's one of the most extraordinary stories of human manifestation in the 20th Century. Really. He arrived in America in 1965 at age 69 with $20, a type writer and a mantra. That's it. And in the front row for the entire phenomena was Shyamasundar Das who was "the Swami's" private secretary for seven years. His new book "Chasing Rhinos with The Swami" chronicles his life, times and adventures with him from 1967 until 1975. Our podcast talked a lot about the early days of the movement, how it took hold in the Haight Ashbury in the Summer of Love, what Krishna Consciousness is and a few amazingly intimate stories of life with A. C. BHAKTIVEDANTA SWAMI. No matter what you may think of the Hare Krishna movement, I urge you to put all that aside and listen with an open heart and mind. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, I hung on every word!</p> <p>About Shyamasundar Das:</p> <p>I was born in the body of Samuel Speerstra, in Salem, Oregon in May,1942. From early childhood I thrived on adventure and risk. After graduating from Reed College in 1965, I met Bhaktivedanta Swami in San Francisco in January 1967, and immediately became his disciple Shyamasundar Das. The Swami wed me to my girlfriend Melanie (Malati Devi Dasi) in a smoke-filled storefront in Haight-Ashbury we called the Radha-Krishna Temple.</p> <p>In 1968, to please Swamiji, I traveled with five chosen devotees to London. There, we witnessed firsthand Krishna's magic display; we befriended the Beatles and, courtesy of Apple Records, spread Hare Krishna Mantra around the world. In October 1970, the Swami took twenty of his Western disciples to India, and together-as Prabhupad and his Dancing White Elephants--we barnstormed the country. In June 1971, Prabhupad accepted me as his Personal Secretary. I was by Prabhupad's side, day and night, in Europe, USA, Africa, Asia, Australia-even behind Brezhnev's Iron Curtain. I never saw him sleep, I never saw him make an error of any kind. How did I get this lucky, to observe close-up the life of the Perfect Person? Srila Prabhupad, the Magic Man himself!</p> <p><a href= "http://chasingrhinos.com/index.php/product/chasing-rhinos-with-the-swami/"> To buy the book click here or visit chashingrhinos.com</a></p> <p> </p> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2410" src= "http://zachleary.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/shyamasundar2.png" alt="" width="204" height="306" /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Human sexuality and the extremely fascinating yet complex rabbit hole that encompasses is one of the most fascinating topics to explore. My good friend Zoë Kors and I spent an hour barely scratching the surface of our cultures relationship to sex, our hang ups, the politics around it and most specifically women's issues and why they are so important. Zoë is an expert in helping women to get in touch with their core divinity that allows them to be the most potent manifestations of their incarnations. I really enjoyed this topic and wonder why I don't talk about it more on IAH, so I'll be sure to have Zoë back on.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human sexuality and the extremely fascinating yet complex rabbit hole that encompasses is one of the most fascinating topics to explore. My good friend Zoë Kors and I spent an hour barely scratching the surface of our cultures relationship to sex, our hang ups, the politics around it and most specifically women's issues and why they are so important. Zoë is an expert in helping women to get in touch with their core divinity that allows them to be the most potent manifestations of their incarnations. I really enjoyed this topic and wonder why I don't talk about it more on IAH, so I'll be sure to have Zoë back on.

Really, we sat on wooden chairs talking about the pitfalls of spiritual materialism and how western influences can make for strange bedfellows with eastern modalities. The other guys on the stage are wonderfully sharp and thoughtful and are all great podcast hosts in and of their own right. I highly recommend you check them all out.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>There are many great teachers and musicians who have come on the IAH podcast but I have to say that the magic, wisdom and love that Jai Uttal brought to the kitchen table was like nothing else. Jai effortlessly weaves together stories, knowledge and devotion into one voice like few others can do. We talked about his early days studying with Ali Akbar Khan, the landscape of spirituality and the 1960s, his passion for Indian classical music and kirtan and of course Neem Karoli Baba. Hearing Jai tell these stories had me forgetting that I was supposed to be on the other side of the table guiding the conversation. It was as if I was I was floating down the Ganga yearning for more of the unique musical magic that Jai creates. <a href="https://lnk.to/rootsrockrama">His new album "Roots, Rock, Rama!" is out now. </a></p> <div class="page" title="Page 1"> <div class="layoutArea"> <div class="column"> <p>Jai Uttal has been rightly hailed as a world music pioneer. Singer, multi-instrumentalist and producer, he was among the first to hear the universal heartbeat in the variegated rhythms of the globe. But his powerful, plangent voice and panoramic musical vision have also long been at the core of the yoga community’s tradition of call-and response devotional chanting known as kirtan. While his music is deeply rooted in Indian classical tradition—he studied long and hard under the Indian sarod master Ali Akbar Khan—it is also plentifully imbued with echoes of reggae, rock, folk, Brazilian music, Bollywood and other sounds from across the musical universe. All of these diverse and colorful strands are woven together beautifully on <em>Roots, Rock, Rama!</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.jaiuttal.com">www.jaiuttal.com</a></p> </div> </div> </div>]]></description>

I got so much out of this one.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode grew out of my desire to take a focussed look at race in America. Through all the chaos of the talking heads, Obamas mixed departure and Trump's inexplicable rise it felt like a good time to examine this crucial issue in a way that felt more human and community based.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We are all DEVO! This episode stops by the famous Mutato Studios on the Sunset Strip to sit down with the legendary Mark Mothersbaugh. For over an hour I took part in one of the most brilliant, though provoking, inspiring and wacky conversations that I've ever been a part of. First and foremost, I'm a fan of Mark's and of DEVO. They were one of the most influential bands of my youth through their ahead of their time use of multi media and music. Mark was so generous with his telling of the story behind the de-evolutionary roots of the band as well as his journey into being a soundtrack composer. Mark's view of how technology, media, culture and music fits into one cohesive narrative is unparalleled. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.</p> <p>Mark Mothersbaugh is an American singer, songwriter, composer, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, author and visual artist.</p> <p>Mothersbaugh's music career spans more than 40 years. He came to prominence in the late 1970s as co-founder, lead singer and keyboardist of the new wave band Devo, which released a Top 20 hit in 1980 with the single "Whip It". The band has maintained a cult following throughout its existence. Mothersbaugh is one of the main composers of Devo's music and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. He is one of only two members (along with bass player Gerald Casale) who have been with Devo throughout its entire history.</p> <p>In addition to his work with Devo, Mothersbaugh has made music for television series, films and video games via his production company, Mutato Muzika, most notably as the composer for the popular long-running animated series <em>Rugrats</em> for its entire 13-year run, as well as all three theatrical films. He also has had a solo career which has included four studio albums: <em>Muzik for Insomniaks</em>, <em>Muzik for the Gallery</em>, <em>Joyeux Mutato</em> and <em>The Most Powerful Healing Muzik in the Entire World</em>. In 2004, he was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the BMI Film and TV Awards for his significant contributions to film and television music. Additionally, Mothersbaugh was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Kent State University in 2008.</p>]]></description>

We talked about that, bending the universe, the nature of space and time, black holes and why we must continue to look to the stars for our very survival. This was taped away from the cozy confines of the kitchen table in LA. It was taped live in Miami from her kitchen table! It was a wonderful, provocative and thought provoking interview.

Basking in the love of Maharaj-ji in the three years that followed, KD’s heart was drawn to the practice of Bhakthi Yoga – the yoga of devotion and after two and a half years with Maharaj-ji, he returned to USA – alas, six months after his return, word came that Maharaj-ji had died.</p> <p>krishnadas.com</p>]]></description>

Of course, we also talked about Neem Karoli Baba and what being a seeker was like in the early 70's for a young doctor from Detroit. I can't say enough how much I enjoyed this one - Larry is an endless well of knowledge, wisdom and love. </p> <p>INTRO RANT - The nature of change</p> <p>Larry Brilliant is an American physician, epidemiologist, technologist, author and the former director of Google's philanthropic arm Google.org. Brilliant, a technology patent holder, has been CEO of two public companies and other venture backed start- ups.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This week the transcendental divinity in the form of Juan Ruiz Naupari stopped by the kitchen table to take the IAH podcast on a new journey. He was joined by his translator Eric Baumgartner who beautifully weaved together the language barrier in what proved to be an amazing journey through practical spirituality, discovering ones own true nature, the roots of conflict and suffering and the role consciousness plays in our daily life. At first I was resistant to the idea of doing a foreign language podcast but thank you to my dear brother David Watts, who brought Juan to me, I was able to let go of that and settle into something new and worthwhile for both myself and the show. Juan is truly a potent being that is clearly on the path of something amazing. Being around him immediately makes you relax, open and tune into his frequency. I hope some of this joy is experienced in the audio you're about to experience.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - The need to shorten the election season from here on out. This can be done through legislation.</p> <p>Juan Ruiz Naupari is the creator of <em>Pneuma System</em>, a new Transpersonal perspective based in the comparative study of the ancient spiritual traditions of the planet. This system of self-knowledge, includes Pneuma Breathwork, a powerful, safe and simple practice which opens the way to Amplified States of Consciousness.</p> <p>For more than thirty years he has studied transpersonal states and their application within both a therapeutic and human developmental context through imparting seminars and supporting the inner process of his students across Europe, Asia and the Americas.</p> <p>Currently, he dedicates more than 500 hours a year to giving workshops, seminars and conferences internationally. Among the topics he investigates, the following stand out: Alchemy and Sexuality, The Vedas, elements of Egyptian religion, Greek philosophy, the Gnostic manuscripts of Nag Hammadi, and the history and philosophy of the first Christian Masters.</p> <p>http://www.inkarri.us</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Leah Pearlman joins the IAH podcast to share the story of her life's journey which is truly worth taking note of. It's one of those stories that you perhaps hear a little something about but then forget to follow up on how it turned out. A bright, creative young woman leaves a dream job as an early employee at Facebook to set out on a spiritual journey that was inspired by death, addiction, Burning Man, self love and an overall desire to share the path of the heart with everyone! The manifestation of her journey and intention took form in the wonderfully profound and simple Dharmacomics.com - talking to Leah about this, her journey and all it's twists and turns inspired me and forced me to step back and take a look at my own journey. I hope everyone who listens to this finds something here that will inspire a little time to reflect and admire your own brilliance and to possibly make changes where possible. Leah is a wonderful shining light.</p> <p>Leah Pearlman drew her first comic in 2010 when her dad’s cancer went into remission. She drew a comic announcing the good news and posted it on Facebook.</p> <p>A week later, after encouraging a friend to “follow his heart,” an image of someone literally following his heart popped into her mind. She laughed, and then <a class="link" href= "http://dharmacomics.com/comic/follow-your-heart/">put it on paper</a>.</p> <p>And so it goes. About once a week, ever since, she’s been moved by something or someone in her life. She illustrates the moment to celebrate it and the person who inspired her and posts the image online for anyone else it may touch. People often reflect that Dharma Comics have a deeply personal feel; that is because each one is deeply personal. They all have a story.</p> <p>“Dharma” is a Sanskrit word, often used in Buddhism to refer to the teachings that offer us guidance in life. Dharma can also refer to one’s own purpose or path. Your “Dharma” is what you are meant to do.  Leah often says the name is twofold: Dharma Comics are comics about Dharma, but they have also proven to be her dharma, what she is meant to do.</p> <p><a href="http://dharmacomics.com">www.dharmacomics.com</a></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Trevor stopped by the kitchen table for this truly inspiring episode of IAH. Trevor's gift to the world is his song but what transpires through his music, being and soul is so much more. Like so many of the great artists who came before him, Trevor is thoughtful, smart, intuitive, aware and you get the feeling when talking to him that he's seeing the world in the way that others are not. Our conversation ranged from his early days and upbringing, spirituality in life and music, why love really does heal all wounds and the quest to constantly explore and be a seeker. I'm somewhat of a late convert to Trevor's music and am so grateful that I get to discover this well of brilliance at this point in life.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - When did anti-intellcualism and the celebration of ignorance become the norm?</p> <p>From trevorhallmusic.com:</p> <p>As an eleven year old, playing harmonica beside his father in South Carolina, music quickly became Trevor’s most intimate companion, guide and creative outlet. In his elementary years, he began to write his own songs and perform them locally. At sixteen he recorded his first record, and the following year he left South Carolina to study classical guitar at <strong>Idyllwild Arts Academy</strong>, an international boarding school east of Los Angeles. There, Trevor was introduced to yoga and certain spiritual practices found in India, which greatly influenced his music and his life journey. During his senior year, Trevor signed a record deal with <strong>Geffen Records</strong> and his career as a musician formally began.</p> <p>Trevor quickly broke through the music scene, with such early accomplishments in his career as having a song recorded on the Shrek the Third soundtrack, as well as joining a series of sold-out tours with artists such as <strong>Steel Pulse, The Wailers, Jimmy Cliff, Matisyahu, Michael Franti, SOJA, Brett Dennen </strong>and<strong> Colbie Callait.</strong> Trevor’s quick rise on the scene, however, was ripe with challenges that conflicted with his spiritual life and devotional practice. In order to parallel his life’s path with the messages in his music, Trevor moved into a traditional Hindu ashram in Southern California in 2008. When not on tour, he lived as a monk and devoted his days to spiritual practice and service. His involvement with the temple affected his music and his music quickly became his practice.</p> <p><a href= "http://www.trevorhallmusic.com">www.trevorhallmusic.com</a></p>]]></description>

We spent about an hour talking about the wheel of life, why none of it is permanent, bhakti and buddhism and their relationship and so much more.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The mysterious, wondrous, fastidious and prolific David Jay Brown stops by the IAH podcast to discuss his new book "Dreaming Wide Awake" which deals with the very real phenomena of lucid dreaming. In the true spirit of Davids long standing role as one of the great psychedelic gnostic wunderkinds we cover much more than that. I've known David for the better part of 30 years and our conversation took on many twists and turns starting with a sort of nostalgic but necessary recap of the modern expansion of consciousness movement and all it's players since the 60's. We talked about all the great notables that we had the honor of knowing and why looking deeper is just as important in 2016 as ever before. Also, David's new book helped shine much needed light on a lot of the floatation tank work that I've been doing as of late.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mysterious, wondrous, fastidious and prolific David Jay Brown stops by the IAH podcast to discuss his new book "Dreaming Wide Awake" which deals with the very real phenomena of lucid dreaming. In the true spirit of Davids long standing role as one of the great psychedelic gnostic wunderkinds we cover much more than that. I've known David for the better part of 30 years and our conversation took on many twists and turns starting with a sort of nostalgic but necessary recap of the modern expansion of consciousness movement and all it's players since the 60's. We talked about all the great notables that we had the honor of knowing and why looking deeper is just as important in 2016 as ever before. Also, David's new book helped shine much needed light on a lot of the floatation tank work that I've been doing as of late. This was truly a pleasure and I hope there will be more in the future.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - (long) a trip down memory lane in LA and a look at the new anti-intellectualism movement that is unfortunately gaining steam</p> <p>David Jay Brown (born 1961) is an American writer, interviewer and <a title="Consciousness" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">consciousness</a> researcher.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite combinations within the multi-verse is to take visionary work and combine it with the urban realities that make up real life for most people. It's a necessary exercise to, now and then, step away from the elevated way nature of visionary experience and come back to the inclusionary bond that is all life. Tony Moss stops by the kitchen table to beautifully articulate how his 22 years of entheogenic work has led to profound realizations on the systemic problems of our culture and how to address them with grace. He's not coming to the table with dogmatic firm answers but rather with wonderfully poetic points of view that will open your heart up to asking the right questions. Tony is a wonderful ambassador for the shamanic arts, musicians and entheogen advocates.</p> <p>INTRO RANT - The Landscape of Being on Team Human</p> <p><em>From Tonymoss.me</em></p> <p>"I am a artist, recording artist, and event producer influenced by 20 years of entheogenic study. My work is a synthesis of my interests in art, spirituality, and science, with passionate emphasis & interest in the evolution of human consciousness and greater under-standing and reverance for nature.</p> <p class="font_7"> I've been called a mystic and a rationalist.</p> <p class="font_7"> I marvel at the very presence of our being.

Our one hour conversation wove it's away around the topics of craftsmanship within music, finding ones role in life, what the culture of mid 60's UK and our overall shared love for music. We journeyed through his career somewhat chronologically to cover his work with Robert Fripp, his jazz albums and of course The Police. If you're a fan of music of any kind this episode is for you.

Our one hour conversation wove it's away around the topics of craftsmanship within music, finding ones role in life, what the culture of mid 60's UK and our overall shared love for music. We journeyed through his career somewhat chronologically to cover his work with Robert Fripp, his jazz albums and of course The Police. If you're a fan of music of any kind this episode is for you. Andy is truly a remarkable mind, kind soul and unreal talent. </p> <p>Andy Summers is known as the guitarist for the rock band <a title="The Police" href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Police">The Police</a>, he has also recorded twelve solo albums, collaborated with many other artists, toured extensively under his own name, published several books, and composed several film scores. </p> <p>http://andysummers.com</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a new type of episode of the It's All Happening podcast, no guests here - just me. Now and then I'm going to bring you more in depth thoughts around specific issues that I've blogged on, touched upon in podcasts/talks or that have come up in and around my day to day life. </p> <p>These episodes will take on two or more issues with each one being it's own self-contained segment. Please note that these episodes will be short - they will be anywhere from 20-40 minutes in length. So think of these as verbal blog posts or more structured podcast intro segments. I hope you enjoy it. </p> <p>This episode focusses on two issues:</p> <p>1.) Creating Value in the 21st Century - digging into new systems that can define value beyond antiquarian methods like the GDP</p> <p>2.) Institutionalized racism - I'm no race relations expert or even a community leader but I did want to share my view of Institutional Racism from the lens of growing up an Angeleno in the 1980's and 90s.</p> <p>For more visit..</p> <p>www.zachleary.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My dear friend, brother, teacher and all around inspiration Govind Das stops by the kitchen table to talk with me about what yoga means in a 21st Century application, the path of bhakti, how to combat the Maya, embracing ones dharma and finding compassion in these troubling times. Govind Das is truly one of the great American yoga teachers and you should check out his classes and offerings whenever possible.</p> <p>INTRO TOPIC - my confusion around the new age community and the recent police brutality events.</p> <p><strong>Govind Das</strong> first came to yoga while living in Los Angeles in 1994 because of health concerns- specifically ulcerative colitis/crohn's/inflammatory bowel disease... After years of many different practices with the intention of healing(hatha yoga, ayurveda, buddhist meditation etc), Ira Rosen found his yogic "home' in the path of Bhakti Yoga... the aspect of yoga frequently described as the "yoga of the heart" or "the yoga of love and devotion". Not by avoiding or denying our life and health challenges, but only by accepting and courageously moving through and forward, the flower of our full appreciation and devotion to Life blooms. It is in this tradition of "Bhakti/Devotion" where Ira was given his spiritual name- Govind Das or simply "Govindas" which means "servant of the Divine"... This path of service is at the root of his spiritual life- to serve the Love and Spirit that lives in the hearts of all. His journey has led him to India on 5 different occasions to immerse himself in the ways of the yoga tradition at the Ashram of his "Guru" or main spirtual teacher- Neem Karoli Baba, as well as spending time in holy yogic places like Vrindavan, Varanasi, Rishikesh and many more... Through his journeys to the "motherland of yoga"- India, Govindas has been blessed to enjoy the "darshan" or be in the company of many yogic saints, sadhus, and wise teachers- It is from these transmissions that Govindas shares the authenticity of the Bhakti path... As well Govindas would like to express heartfelt gratitude to his yoga teachers here in California - <em>Bryan Kest, Saul David Raye, Shiva Rea,</em> and <em>Mark Whitwell</em>... and bow to his Bhakti and Kirtan teachers <em>Ram Dass</em>, <em>Jai Uttal</em>, <em>Bhagavan Das, Krishna Das, Shyam Das, Raghu Markus</em>and many many more...</p> <p><a href= "http://www.bhaktiyogashala.com">www.bhaktiyogashala.com</a></p>]]></description>

Extending beyond that I also found our talk to be very inspirational into looking at my own health and complete physiological package. She is brilliant, articulate, thoughtful, very well educated, gorgeous and has a life force to aspire to. I'd love to have Molly be a regular health contributor on the podcast and hopefully this is just the first of many episodes together.</p> <p>INTRO TOPIC - the quest for equanimity.</p> <p>Dr. Molly Maloof's goal is to maximize human potential by dramatically extending human healthspan through scientific wellness, technology, & educational media. When she saw the digital revolution transforming medicine she knew she had to be a part of it. Since 2012 she has worked as an independent advisor and strategy consultant to over 18 technology companies in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. Her fascination with innovation has transferred into her private medical practice, which is focused on providing health optimization and personalized medicine to entrepreneurs, investors, and executives. Her iterative programs take the quantified self to the extreme through comprehensive testing of clinical chemistry, metabolomics, microbiome, biometrics, and genomic markers. She favors the use of food over pharmacology and believes the next frontier in health tech is the exploration of our “inner media.”</p> <p>www.mollymaloofmd.com</p>]]></description>

Elliot Mintz stands as of one of those greats who, in my opinion, is one of the most astute cultural anthropologists of our time. This podcast was done in his living room as we waxed poetic about the early days of celebrity culture in 1963, the innocence that surrounded that time, spiritual integrity, John Lennon, Bob Dylan and so much more. I found this interview to be one of the most fascinating and engrossing I've ever done. Also, note that Elliot has one of the great voices and most articulate delivery systems ever. Enjoy.</p> <p>NOTE - very long into rant about Brexit and the illusion of separation. </p> <p>Elliot Mintz is an American media consultant and publicist. In the 1960s and early 1970s Mintz was an underground radio DJ and host. In the 1970s he became a spokesperson for John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and took on other musicians and actors as clients as a publicist ranging from Bob Dylan to Diana Ross.</p> <p>www.elliotmintz.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>While hundreds are practicing yoga and singing kirtan, Sridhar and I find a quiet place to sit down and do a podcast in the middle of the annual Shakti Fest festival in Joshua Tree, California. Our conversation takes on a wide biographical tone in that I used Sridhar's amazing life as the backdrop for a discussion on the practice of yoga, the wisdom of Bhakti and the complicated nature behind this whole guru thing. Sridhar has one of the most colorful lives I've ever come across and I can say without any ego, that's saying a lot. </p> <p>While many people may know him as the Godfather of Bhakti Fest, Sridhar Silberfein has a long and storied history in the spirituality and health and wellness communities. He arranged to have Swami Satchidananda on stage at Woodstock to lead the Western world’s first mass Sanskrit chanting. And since the 1970s, one of the first stops in the US for many great spiritual teachers has been the Center for Spiritual Studies, a nonprofit organization Sridhar founded. Sridhar’s mission for everyone he meets or influences is to provide assistance to go deeper into Sadhana (or spiritual practice)—even if it requires a dose of tough love.</p> <p>www.bhaktifest.com</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Rick and I explore the multi-verse, MAPS 30th Anniversary and the complicated, rewarding and revolutionary road that psychedelics has seen over the course of the last 50 years. Recorded off site at the University of Pennsylvania where Rick and I were both panelists at the BioEthics Film Conference. This is a podcast that I've been wanting to do since Day 1 and I'm happy we made it work! </p>
<p>Rick Doblin, Ph.D., is the founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). He received his doctorate in Public Policy from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, where he wrote his <a href="http://maps.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5402">dissertation</a> on the regulation of the medical uses of psychedelics and marijuana and his <a href="http://maps.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5403">Master's thesis</a> on a survey of oncologists about smoked marijuana vs. the oral THC pill in nausea control for cancer patients. His <a href="http://www.maps.org/research-archive/cluster/psilo-lsd/goodfriday.pdf">undergraduate thesis</a> at New College of Florida was a 25-year follow-up to the classic Good Friday Experiment, which evaluated the potential of psychedelic drugs to catalyze religious experiences. He also conducted a thirty-four year <a href="http://www.maps.org/research-archive/1998_Doblin_ConcordPrisonFollow-up.pdf">follow-up study</a> to Timothy Leary’s Concord Prison Experiment. Rick studied with Dr. Stanislav Grof and was among the first to be certified as a Holotropic Breathwork practitioner. His professional goal is to help develop legal contexts for the beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana, primarily as prescription medicines but also for personal growth for otherwise healthy people, and eventually to become a legally licensed psychedelic therapist. He founded MAPS in 1986, and currently resides in Boston with his wife and three children.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was so honored to have Snatam Kaur join the podcast! She is one of the most angelic and potent spiritual masters in the West. Her music has been such a blessing in my life as it has so many thousands of others. On this episode we talk about establishing a practice, the history of mantra music, the science and metaphysical properties of chanting, optimism and her new book "Original Light: The Morning Practice of Kundalini Yoga."</p>
<p>Snatam Kaur is an American singer, peace activist and author raised in the Sikh and Kundalini Yoga tradition. She has an amazing ability to transform traditional Sikh chants of India into a contemporary sound that appeals to the modern ear and awakens an ancient yearning in the soul. For over thirty years, she studied with and grew up in the presence of her spiritual teacher, Yogi Bhajan, while he was in his physical form, learning the essence of Naad Yoga, a form of yoga focusing on sacred sound. At the core of this practice is an essential experience of peace and healing which has helped her music to be accessible to people of all walks of life. She has taught and shared Naad Yoga and Kundalini Yoga and meditation through her recorded CDs, concerts, and workshops for the past sixteen years as a part of her commitment to give people tools for a daily experience of inner peace. Her new book Original Light; the Morning Practice of Kundalini Yoga is a compassionate and supportive guide to creating a personal daily spiritual practice.  To find out more about her concerts and workshops, her book and her online course, Life Guided By Light, visit snatamkaur.com.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The mayor of all things great, my good friend, rock and roll master shaman and Bhakti legend Shiva Baum comes by to do an episode of IAH. We explore friendship, kirtan and The Church of Rock and Roll and why it still matters.</p>
<p>NOTE - a very long Amanda Chantal Bacon intro rant. Jump to 10:22 if you want skip it.</p>
<p>Shiva Baum has enjoyed a lifelong love affair with music. When he was 19 he began an internship at New York's Sony Music Studios followed by a summer at Columbia Records under the mentorship of then head of A&R David Khane and has never looked back from there. Shiva went on to discover and develop 90's alt rock band VAST who then signed with Elektra Records. Under the tutelage of Raghu Markus, Shiva then transitioned to influential world music label Triloka Records which was a division of Mercury/Polygram. Eventually Shiva became head of A&R working closely with Krishna Das, Jai Uttal and Bhagavan Das as well other world music artists including the Native American gospel group Walela and southern Cuban salsa phenoms Bio Ritmo. Shiva then headed over to Gold Circle records as VP of A&R developing new artists in tandem with working on new releases by seasoned 80's superstars John Waite and Pat Benatar. He has been mentored by industry luminaries Rick Rubin, Danny Goldberg, Jeff Ayeroff, and David Silver. Currently, Shiva is an artist manager, producer and "A&R coach" working closely with new artists BIRA, Brightside, and Clark Graham amongst others following his passion to discover and develop new talent. In addition, he is the main stage MC and head of music programming at the "Coachella of Kirtan" known as Bhakti Fest in Joshua Tree, CA. Shiva is very looking forward to the launch of a sacred music focussed podcast which he'll be hosting this year.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The amazing and inspirational Ashley Booth stops by the kitchen table to discuss her own transformational face to face experience with God, the founding of the Aware Project and following your heart even when it seems impossible.</p>
<p>Ashley is the founder of the Aware Project that produces educational events in Los Angeles, California. She is balancing the conversation about psychoactive compounds in order to have intelligent, level-headed conversations on the responsible uses of psychedelics for both clinical and therapeutic purposes. Through her own inner work, she has developed a passion for removing the stigma and fear surrounding psychedelics. Her strength comes from combining a background in the sciences with a bigger and deeper view of humanity and the world. She inspires audiences to question what they’ve been told, do their homework, and form their own opinions.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mirabai is the author of the new book "Caravan of No Despair - A memoir of Loss And Transformation". She stops my IAH to talk about her new book, the power of attachment, the lessons that come from loss and finding beauty even in the darkest times.</p>
<p>Mirabai Starr writes, speaks and leads retreats on the inter-spiritual teachings of the mystics.</p>
<p>Known for her revolutionary translations of John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, and Julian of Norwich, Mirabai renders mystical masterpieces accessible, beautiful, and relevant to a contemporary circle of seekers. Her commentaries on the interconnected wisdom of all traditions are lyrical and evocative.</p>
<p>Mirabai builds bridges not only between religious traditions, but also between contemplative life and compassionate service, between cultivating an inner relationship with the Beloved and expressing that intimacy in community, between the transformational power of loss and longing for the sacred.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>A new and different episode of It's All Happening! This one is called the "Community Podcast Vol. 1." The general idea is to bring you a few different guests who are doing amazing works in the community. Arjuna O'Neal, Raja Michelle and Kelsea Rea are, respectively, doing some cool things in and around LA that help promote wellness, helping the underserved and bringing awareness to where our great city is lacking. </p>
<p>Also, I'm fresh of the Open Your Heart in Paradise retreat with Ram Dass, Krishna Das and friends. So I took this opportunity to go on a little rant about how this was the best OYHIP yet and how I'm still trying to make sense of the love portal that can be experienced there. </p>
