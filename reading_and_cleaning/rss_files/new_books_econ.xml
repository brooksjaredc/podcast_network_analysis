		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlO2OkrcRtkJ5pD1vaQjQu4AAAFjWpRkSAEAAAFKAUCdB3M/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1612509673/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1612509673&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=wLtta.YWKwSjS-Aj8hh6Hg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Future of University Credentials: New Developments at the Intersection of Higher Education and Hiring</a> (Harvard Education Press, 2016) offers a thorough and urgently needed overview of the burgeoning world of university degrees and credentials. At a time of heightened attention to how universities and colleges are preparing young people for the working world, questions about the meaning and value of university credentials have become especially prominent. <a href="https://cps.northeastern.edu/faculty/sean-gallagher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean R. Gallagher</a>, EdD, guides us through this fast-changing terrain, providing much-needed context, details, and insights.<br />
The book casts a wide net, focusing on traditional higher education degrees and on the myriad certificates and other postsecondary awards that universities and other institutions now issue. He describes the entire ecosystem of credentials, including universities and colleges, employers, government agencies, policy makers and influencers—and, not least, the students whose futures are profoundly affected by these certifications. And he looks intently at where university credentials might be headed, as educational institutions seek to best serve students and employers in a rapidly changing world.<br />

When Austria was the first interwar country in Europe to suffer a hyperinflation the League of Nations stepped in to offer financial support and advice. But a total collapse of the financial system in 1931 couldn’t be avoided. Nathan Marcus offers a new perspective on the already well researched subject and an individual approach not only with regards to content but also on a methodological level by interlacing multiple perspectives and sources (such as journals and caricatures, literature, anecdotes etc.) with each other to create a wider understanding for the events.<br />
Nathan Marcus is an Assistant Professor of Modern European History at the Higher School of Economics, National Research University, Saint Petersburg, Russia.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today I was joined by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Seamus_Grimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seamus Grimes</a> from Ireland where he is Emeritus Professor at the National University of Ireland, Galway. With <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yutao_Sun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yutao Sun</a> (Dalian University of Technology), he just published a very interesting and timely book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkY4uaMADg3mMsotY6slLxkAAAFjELrlhgEAAAFKAU6NZqQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138289078/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1138289078&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=M10Tfnp2bEGw6TwTKTZZKw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China and Global Value Chains: Globalization and the Information and Communications Technology Sector</a> (Routledge, 2018).<br />
President Trump has raised the intriguing question of bringing the manufacturing of companies like Apple back from China to the U.S. This book, however, argues that in this age of the knowledge-based economy and increased globalization, that value creation and distribution based on knowledge and innovation activities are at the core of economic development. The double-edged sword of globalization has transformed China’s economic development in the past few decades. Although China has benefitted from globalization and is now the second largest economy in the world, having become a global manufacturing power and the biggest exporter of high-tech products, it continues to be highly dependent on foreign sources of capital and technology.<br />
The book explores the core of the Chinese economy from the perspective of the global value chain, combining analysis of inward investment, international trade, science and technology and innovation and economic development. Specifically, it investigates China’s evolving role with some innovative Chinese companies emerging in the global market and China’s ongoing efforts to become an innovation-driven economy.<br />
This is a very interesting book on the complexity of the global industrial systems that are behind the production of the electronic goods that we use daily. Beside China and this specific sector, it is a timely warning for those that argue in favour of raising barriers or regulating otherwise the current flow of goods and components worldwide.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I met in Rome, at Sapienza University, with two of the three editors of a great new book in economics. <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/MarcellaCorsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marcella Corsi</a> is professor of economics at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, and editor of the International Review of Sociology. <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/cdippoliti" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlo D’Ippoliti</a> is associate professor of economics at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, and editor of PSL Quarterly Review. He is also one of the hosts of this channel. The third editor is <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/scholars/jan-kregel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan Kregel</a>, director of research at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, USA, and professor of development finance at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia. He is also co-editor of the Journal of Post-Keynesian Economics.<br />
<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qh5zQ-mE5aObtadfFyB0PRIAAAFiykHXXgEAAAFKAXCokow/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1783087501/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1783087501&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=V.I3wIizVJi84W57IqF-ww&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Classical Economics Today</a> (Anthem Press, 2018) is a collection of essays in honour of Alessandro Roncaglia. It provides an overview on his contributions and on the Classical tradition in Economics. It is a history of ideas in Economics but also an attempt to discuss their contemporary relevance to economic policy and economic theory.<br />
The contributors to the volume, like all classical economists in general, regard history as a useful tool of analysis rather than a specialist object of investigation. By denying that a single, all-encompassing mathematical model can explain everything we are interested in, Classical political economy necessarily requires a comparison and integration of several pieces of theory as the only way to discuss economics and economic policy. Economists inspired by the Classical approach believe that economic theory is historically conditioned: as social systems evolve, the appropriate theory to represent a certain phenomenon must evolve too. Therefore, plurality in methods, including the history of economic thought, must be a deliberate choice, as evidenced by the essays in Classical Economics Today: Essays in Honor of Alessandro Roncaglia.<br />
The book is a tribute to Alessandro Roncaglia, to his personality and his research interests. Roncaglia’s research is based on Schumpeter’s dictum that good economics must encompass history, economic theory and statistics, and therefore does not generally take the form of elegant formal models that are applicable to all and everything. In this direction, Roncaglia is inspired by the Classical economists of the past, and becomes a model for present-day Classical economists.<br />
This is a book for economists, particularly for those who regard history of economic thought as a useful tool of analysis rather than a specialist object of investigation. But the book is approachable by students and non-economists too. The non-expert reader would be delighted to discover that economics is different to what they expected.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today I was joined by <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/arts/political_economy/staff/profiles/martijn.konings.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martijn Konings</a> from Australia where he is Associate Professor of Political Economy at the University of Sydney. We had a conversation on his most recent book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QkcGyGchCgCFsr1uKHGF6ZAAAAFiXZC26QEAAAFKAdn--Vk/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1503604438/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1503604438&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=i1MguhzryzyUIitGXiru-Q&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capital and Time: For a New Critique of Neoliberal Reason</a> (Stanford University Press, 2018).<br />
Its main contribution is to offer an original point of view on the issue of speculation. Critics of capitalist finance tend to focus on its speculative character. Our financial markets, they lament, encourage irresponsible bets on the future that reflect no real underlying value. Why is it, then, that opportunities for speculative investment continue to proliferate in the wake of major economic crises? To make sense of this, Capital and Time offers an understanding of economy as a process whereby patterns of order emerge out of the interaction of speculative investments. Speculation, he argues, is an essential intrinsic feature of capitalism and not just a negative spillover or a collateral behavior.<br />
The book also provides an original view on the role of the State. Progressive critics have assumed that the state occupies a neutral, external position from which it can step in to constrain speculative behaviors. On the contrary, Konings argues, the state has always been deeply implicated in the speculative dynamics of economic life. Through these insights, he offers a new interpretation of both the economic problems that emerged during the 1970s and the way that neoliberalism responded to them. Neoliberalism&#8217;s strength derives from its intuition that there is no position that transcends the secular logic of risk, and from its insistence that individuals actively engage that logic.<br />
The book concludes that the current critique of speculation is misleading and incapable of recognizing how American capitalism has come to embrace speculation and has thus been able to generate new kinds of order and governance. This is a very interesting book, written in an accessible way despite the complexity of the topic.<br />

Utilizing over a decade of community engagement and research, Meiu expertly engages in intense anthropological study without exploitation and judgment. Rather he succeeds in humanizing his subjects as he explores the creation and development of a new economy, that of engaging with white, largely Western European women, in romantic relationships in exchange for money, goods and, eventually, higher economic and social status in their home rural communities. But with this new economy comes challenges to traditional social structures, as sexuality and wealth intersect with traditional land tenure and power. Meiu, with his deep understanding of the Samburu people, rituals and culture, explores how power dynamics change, and how new money is challenged and reconciled. This book is highly readable, without skimping on academic literature and theoretical context, resulting in a book that will engage everyone from first year anthropology students through seasoned academics.<br />

Why do we omit or misrepresent important features of the work of Adam Smith, Max Weber or Frederick Winslow Taylor? What is the forgotten origin of Harvard Business School case method?<br />
I was joined by two of the authors&#8212;<a href="https://twitter.com/strategybuild">Stephen Cummings</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ToddBridgman">Todd Bridgman</a>&#8212; of<a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QrGwQp4AoXs5Mm7qUUFv7OkAAAFiONIAzwEAAAFKAftZgT8/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1316502902/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1316502902&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=IIqywvxmI0iT55At9R1YvQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A New History of Management</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2016), a great new book that answers those and many more questions. The book is a very important contribution to critical management studies that uncovers the inaccuracies and simplifications (if not actual inventions) that populate management and organization textbooks. A New History of Management is not a conspiracy theory, but rather it is the result of rigorous historical research on how the field of management studies was constructed in the past century. The authors argue that the existing narratives about how we should organize are built upon, and reinforce, a concept of &#8220;good management&#8221; derived from what is assumed to be a fundamental need to increase efficiency. But this assumption is based on a presentist, monocultural, and generally limited view of management&#8217;s past. This book is for both scholars and practitioners, tutors and students. Academics will be able to reflect critically on the nature of business education and on conformism in teaching and research. Practitioners and students will be able to challenge what they have been taught as a scientific rather than ideological artifact.<br />
Both students and scholars will be able to discuss alternative approaches for managing and organizing in the twenty-first century. Animated videos on the book are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTvua598jsA0PPeGK4FnSg">here</a>.<br />

In her new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QpjzdnSmHg2Co74lVITPTKIAAAFh0jXQZQEAAAFKAfx09EM/http://www.amazon.com/dp/3319617648/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=3319617648&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=5xGrXff2IybSVH6XMwBvJg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banking on Health: The World Bank and Health Sector Reform in Latin America</a> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), <a href="http://www.shirinoy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiri Noy</a> explores this question and more using mixed methods, including interviews, quantitative analysis, and review of policy documents and archives. The book starts off by providing readers a history of the World Bank and its role in health reform. Even though it may seem as if the World Bank would have a similar solution across countries, Noy finds that involvement and plans are more variable due to the systems already in place within these countries. Noy then moves on to an analysis of health expenditures, finding surprising results that further drove her research project and curiosity. The book then explores three countries in turn: Argentina, Peru, and Costa Rica. This book provides rich analysis of a complex social issue and set of systems, sending the reader away with both empirical and theoretical findings.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by sociologists broadly but particularly by historical sociologists or those studying Latin America specifically. This book will be of interest to political scientists and health scholars as well. Graduate level courses in health and stratification could utilize this book not only for understanding health reform and the role of the World Bank, but also in terms of the fascinating case studies of the three countries contained here.<br />

Late Imperial and Republican China (1860-1949) was dominated of Neo-Confucian social hierarchies, under which advanced age and generational seniority were the primary determinants of sociopolitical status. This allowed many poor but senior individuals to possess status and political authority highly disproportionate to their wealth. In comparison, in the more individualistic early modern England (1500-1700) landed wealth was a fairly strict prerequisite for high status and authority. This essentially excluded low-income individuals from secular positions of prestige and leadership. Zhang argues that this social difference had major consequences for property institutions and agricultural production.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the last few weeks, minimum wage workers in 18 states saw their wages go up; in Maine a full dollar increase. Why states have taken the lead on raising the minimum wage is the topic of the new book from <a href="https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/our-people/faculty-staff/witko_christopher.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Witko</a> and <a href="http://community.wvu.edu/~wwf0002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">William Franko</a>, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QjitLBN4ymypbbnrQCHs_rIAAAFhrmlOuAEAAAFKARi14oY/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190671017/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0190671017&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=gjPdmbvH-unQDmVZm3uDcw&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Economic Populism: How States Respond to Economic Inequality</a> (Oxford University Press, 2017). Witko is associate professor of political science at the University of South Carolina; Franko is assistant professor of political science at West Virginia University.<br />
In the book, they argue, despite rising inequality, the federal government has been unable to muster the will to address the problem. Instead, we are seeing many states actively addressing economic inequality, often through direct democracy. Franko and Witko show that the states that address inequality are not necessarily those with the greatest levels of inequality, but instead are those states where citizens are aware and concerned with growing inequality. They examine how various factors have shaped state policies that boost incomes at the bottom (the minimum wage and the Earned Income Tax Credit) and reduce incomes at the top (with top marginal tax rates) between 1987 and 2010.<br />

In the media and popular imagination, the wealthy are often presented as self-serving people who single-mindedly accrue and display social advantages for themselves and their children. Sherman&#8217;s findings destroy this stereotype. Instead, she found that the wealthy believed in diversity and meritocracy. They were often reluctant to talk about their wealth and were conflicted about their position in a class-based society. The rich wanted to see themselves as hard working people who give back and raise children with good values. They longed to be considered morally worthy and generally depicted themselves as productive and prudent.<br />

Fridman begins his investigation by looking into a best-selling book in what he calls financial self-help, an ascendant genre of self-help that tries to teach its readers how they should think about the economy today and what their goals and ethics ought to be as actors in that new economy. Using ethnographic and interview methods, Fridman gets to know the people who practice the advice of these books, participating in their various seminars and fascinating financially-focused board-game meet-ups. Fridman unpacks the core ideas that animate this world and shows that, far from being an isolated ideology, the worldview posited by financial self-help can teach us a lot about how people are remaking themselves as economic actors in the world today. Adding another level of analysis, the book also has a comparative component as Fridman tracks these groups and ideas as they play out across different cultures in the United States and in Argentina. This book will excite anyone interesting in making sense of the profound human changes that come attendant with our rapidly changing economy.<br />

The shift of world populations into cities and the increasing concentration of activities in urban areas have generated new debates about cities as well as rejuvenating old debates, turning them into global concerns. The economics of cities and regions has, therefore, attained a particularly important status in the twenty-first century. Yet many writers on urban economic issues have never formally studied the subject. Many are mainstream economists who apply their general (equilibrium) economics to cities, but most of them have very little appreciation of the political economy of cities and much less understanding of the built environment, its history, complexities, and peculiarities. The result is the rise of a highly mathematical, mystical urban economics abstracted from critical political, institutional, and social processes at a time when real-world urban economics is urgently needed. This book seeks to offer a corrective to this state of affairs, and to generate further interest in critical real-world urban economics. Through the analysis, exposition, and critique of the urban world in which we live, the book shows fundamental contradictions in the wisdom that more mainstream urban economists have offered over the years. It offers clear alternatives that show that another urban world is possible.<br />

The book considers whether capitalism or government policies are to blame. Cohen considers the historical changes that have taken place in America, including the post WWII economy, globalization, and technological advances. Rather than focus on individual spending, Cohen argues that we need to take a structural approach and also do some cross-country comparison to truly understand the financial reality of American households. This book also provides interesting discussion around how we even measure financial well-being and hardship, for instance the distinction between officially poor according to federal government limits versus relative poverty. Overall, using clear examples and data illustrations, Cohen presents a comprehensive and historical overview of the financial states of American households and provides readers with some important takeaways and questions that we must ask ourselves if we want to build a better America.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by sociologists, but also those interested in economics and public policy. It would be good for any social inequality or stratification class. It provides clear examples and typologies, which would be useful for any higher level undergraduate sociology class.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/political-science/assistant-professor-emily-nacol">Emily C. Nacol</a> has written a fascinating interrogation of the idea of risk, the concept of vulnerability, and the evolution of probabilistic thinking as conceived of and explored by four of the preeminent British thinkers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Nacol&#8217;s book, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/10891.html">An Age of Risk: Politics and Economy in Early Modern Britain</a>, (Princeton University Press, 2016) examines the political, economic, and epistemological works of Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, David Hume, and Adam Smith. Each thinker&#8217;s ideas are explored in regard to the way they consider risk, which itself was a fairly new concept and had grown out of maritime concerns. An Age of Risk traces the concept itself within political thinking, and why it grows into an important dimension of the works by these theorists. Nacol explains that Hobbes, Locke, Hume, and Smith thought differently about risk and, as a result, structured their theories in distinct ways. She examines how Hobbes and Locke are generally concerned with minimizing risk, and their thinking is designed to more directly try to limit risk or alleviate the potential within political society and the economy. In the analysis of Hume&#8217;s work and of Smith&#8217;s work, Nacol finds a different approach to risk especially in Hume&#8217;s estimation that humans will inevitably have to contend with risk and uncertainty, and this leads to the consideration of political emotions like anxiety and fear. Smith, Nacol notes, moves into the realm of probabilistic thinking in his work as he integrates considerations of risk and uncertainty into his political and economic thought. All four thinkers provide lenses through which to consider this concept of vulnerability and what it means to an individual, and to political and economic orders.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Every young generation inspires a host of comparisons&#8212;usually negative ones&#8212;with older generations. Whether preceding a criticism or punctuating one, &#8220;kids these days&#8221; is a common utterance. Perhaps because of the ubiquity of the internet and their heavy presence on it, Millennials have been the most parsed and monitored generation as its members are still in the process of coming of age in history. Stereotypes abound in the media and popular culture: Millennials are lazy, entitled, narcissistic, and immature. Synthesizing an array of social science research that has been conducted not just on this cohort but on the society they find themselves struggling to navigate, writer <a href="https://www.littlebrown.com/contributor/malcolm-harris/">Malcolm Harris</a> in <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qgpbb4EVEl3x6ZSIy2CoNzUAAAFg5ZgxzQEAAAFKAaQb3rg/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0316510866/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0316510866&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=r3TlNOnFL-tlUlEGtf9l0g&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials</a> (Little, Brown and Company, 2017) aims to get readers to question these stereotypes and myths and instead think about how Millennials are trying to survive within today&#8217;s shifting social structures and conditions. More than any other generation, Millennials have been raised to think of everything they do as a way to build human capital and invest in their own future. And they do so at time in American history when higher education is becoming increasingly expensive as wages are declining, work is becoming more precarious and less stable, and the future of the social safety net is showing signs of either eroding or at least completely transforming in the future. In short, the book refreshingly considers the forces that have helped shape who Millennials are and why they behave and think as they do. With luck, it will encourage a discussion of the root causes behind serious problems that this young cohort confronts (precarity, youth poverty, over-medication, and over-work) and their possible solutions instead of the same tired stereotypes.<br />

Situated in Colorado Springs she reconstructs the life of her shrewd and ambitious grandfather Walter Davis, who emerged from virtually nowhere to become a small town finance man running the City Savings Building and Loan Association. He gained and betrayed the trust of hundreds of depositors who invested their life savings to secure the American dream of homeownership and financial security. They found their lives destroyed by an unregulated industry and Davis&#8217;s dishonest practices. Shortfall is both the story of American capitalism told from the bottom up and of Echols uncovering her own family secrets of ill-gotten gain, decadence, scandal, loss, and ultimate despair that reflected the lives of millions across the nation. Shortfall offers lessons in the dangers associated with small-town finance men, land speculators, depositors in denial, ill-equipped investigators, inexperienced judges and an unregulated financial marketplace.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I was joined by <a href="http://haifa.academia.edu/EliCook" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eli Cook</a> from Israel to talk about his amazing new book <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qjroxeey0JGmhBOL7hW-ryYAAAFf9DW7kQEAAAFKAeX4nW8/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674976282/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0674976282&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=Fg5QqUvv-E2K-JxZX2fyoQ&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pricing of Progress: Economic Indicators and the Capitalization of American Life</a> (Harvard University Press, 2017). While economists and politicians are busy discussing alternative measures of progress, Eli Cook traces the long history that brought us to use the GDP as a measure of growth, success, power, wellbeing. This is not only the history of technical metrics, this is the history of ideas and of a dominant paradigm. According to the author the invention of GDP was the final step not only in the pricing of progress but also the capitalization of American life.<br />
How did Americans come to quantify their society&#8217;s progress and well-being in units of money? In today&#8217;s GDP-run world, prices are the standard measure of not only our goods and commodities but our environment, our communities, our nation, even our self-worth.The Pricing of Progress traces the long history of how and why we moderns adopted the monetizing values and valuations of capitalism as an indicator of human prosperity while losing sight of earlier social and moral metrics that did not put a price on everyday life.<br />
Eli Cook roots the rise of economic indicators in the emergence of modern capitalism and the contested history of English enclosure, Caribbean slavery, American industrialization, economic thought, and corporate power. He explores how the maximization of market production became the chief objective of American economic and social policy.<br />
As economic elites quantified the nation as a for-profit, capitalized investment, the progress of its inhabitants, free or enslaved, came to be valued according to their moneymaking abilities. The book is a beautiful and enjoyable account of how capitalism shaped our societies: not only introducing a new social order of production and consumption but also through a new way of measuring the value of our economies, of our societies and, eventually, of ourselves.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I was joined by <a href="http://host.uniroma3.it/centri/jeanmonnet/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pasquale Tridico</a>, Professor of Political Economy at Roma Tre University in Italy. His latest book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qg2ITd6-8qXkmVYIforDhakAAAFf9CARMQEAAAFKAV5iKfQ/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138944122/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1138944122&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=zV3E.J.7ccEysUKXiAxlTg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inequality in Financial Capitalism</a>, was published by Routledge in 2017. The issue of inequality has regained attention in the economic and political debate. This is due to both an increase in income inequality, in particular among rich countries but not only, and an increasing interest in this topic by researchers, policy makers and political movements. In this book, the author presents figures and insights on several possible causes of inequality but focuses on the role of financial capitalism, characterised by the strong dependency of economies on the financial sector, by the intensification of international trade and capital mobility, and by the flexibilisation of labour markets, the reduction of wage shares and a declining welfare redistribution. A conversation on such a complex topic was also the opportunity to briefly mention collateral issues such as the financial crisis, the failure of the Occupy Wall Street protests, and Brexit.<br />

In the post-WWII period of decolonization, experts and state planners in the Global North tested in the real-world the hypotheses of Demographic Transition Theory (industrialization leads to few births which leads to &#8220;better&#8221; lives). In doing so, they repackaged the racist logic of earlier eugenicist definitions of population in the postwar period by harnessing the concept of population, not to environmental limits, but to economic optimization. Murphy show how this postwar &#8220;regime of valuation&#8221; played out on the ground through an extended study of population management and family planning projects in Bangladesh. Murphy&#8217;s work&#8212;which combines a new history of the population concept with an original study of lives lived (and not lived) in Bangladesh&#8212;demonstrates her broader point: namely that seemingly abstract, large scale elements of late-capitalist infrastructures of industrial production depend upon emotional, affective sensibilities about sex and reproduction.<br />
By telling a history of expert concepts of population, the infrastructures that perform it, the affects that pulse through it, and forms of life it continues to produce and prevent, Michelle Murphy invites readers to speculate towards other worlds&#8212;and other words. Murphy teaches us why population is an &#8220;intolerable concept&#8221; and she does the work of imagining other, more just, more apt words we might use in place of &#8220;population.&#8221; She suggests that her term &#8220;distributed reproduction&#8221; might help shift our attention, our thinking, and our practices towards more emancipatory collective responses and responsibilities&#8212;given our own existence as part of infrastructures of racism and violence.<br />

Laura&#8217;s first book, <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo12182576.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behind Closed Doors: IRBs and the Making of Ethical Research</a>, was published in 2012 by University of Chicago Press. Her current research explores how a market for healthy civilian &#8220;human subjects&#8221; emerged in law, science, and popular imagination in the post-World War Two period. It is based on a vernacular archive she created with more than 100 &#8220;normal control&#8221; research subjects and scientists who took part in postwar experiments at the US National Institutes of Health, now archived at Countway Library for the History of Medicine. Overall, Stark&#8217;s work uses social theory to map the intersections of science, morality and the modern state in a global context.<br />

As he explains, consolidation was a trend throughout America during this era. Big business was at the forefront of this, as Wall Street provided the financing necessary for numerous industries to form dominant corporate combinations through mergers and takeovers. The enormous wealth controlled by these titans was prominent throughout the city, both in the new skyscrapers rising to dominate the city&#8217;s skyline and in the cultural and educational institutions that flourished with infusions of their capital. Similar mergers took place in many sectors and aspects of city life, from entertainment to labor, with even the criminal underworld consolidating in a reflection of the times. Wallace&#8217;s book chronicles all of this, as well as the developments in the many communities of a richly diverse city that during these years experienced dramatic growth and changes wrought by a global war.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book provides an exhaustive account of post-Keynesian economics and of the developments that have occurred in post-Keynesian theory and in the world economy over the last twenty years. Topics covered include open-economy issues, the methodological foundations of heterodox economics, consumer theory, firms and pricing, money and credit, effective demand and employment, inflation theory, and growth theories. The interview focuses on the introductory chapter, making the conversation accessible also to an audience of non-economists. The book has been awarded the 2017 Myrdal Prize by EAEPE, the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy, ex aequo with Wolfram Elsner, Torsten Heinrich, Henning Schwardt, The Microeconomics of Complex Economies, Evolutionary, Institutional, Neoclassical, and Complexity Perspectives.<br />

In short, violence on the job has a history. The shift from violence committed by management against striking workers to individualized violence in the form of shootings and assaults among workers occurred as labor unions lost power and splintered into radical and more mainstream factions. By examining the often hyper-masculine heyday of the mid-twentieth-century auto industry, Milloy makes a strong case for a broader definition of what constitutes violence at work under capitalism. In the words of one attorney reflecting on a workplace shooting in a Detroit Chrysler factory, &#8220;Chrysler pulled the trigger.&#8221; The structure of auto manufacturing work itself bred a culture of violence on the factory floor. In both Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario, race, gender, and labor dynamics mediated the relationships between employees in the sprawling auto factories that straddled the Canadian-American border. Blood, Sweat, and Fear tells the stark story of life and death within those plants as the nature of work and labor changed in the late twentieth century.<br />
Jeremy Milloy earned his PhD at Simon Fraser University and is a SSHRC postdoctoral fellow at Trent University.<br />

This formal, accessible treatment of complexity goes beyond the scopes of neoclassical and mainstream economics. The Microeconomics of Complex Economies uses game theory, modeling approaches, formal techniques, and computer simulations to teach useful, accessible approaches to real modern economies. It covers topics of information and innovation, including national and regional systems of innovation; clustered and networked firms; and open-source/open-innovation production and use. This interview, as the final chapter on policy perspectives and decisions, explains the value of the toolset as the highly interdependent economy of the 21st century demands a reconsideration of economic theories. The book has been awarded the 2017 Myrdal Prize by EAEPE, the European Association for Evolutionary Political Economy, Ex aequo with Marc Lavoie for his book on Post-Keynesian Economics: New Foundations (Edward Elgar, 2014).<br />

Swett argues that advertisements played a much greater role in normalizing the Third Reich then previously thought. She highlights how advertisers at all levels enjoyed a great deal of freedom to sell their products, while using the National Socialist message not because they were forced, but because consumers were attuned to it. Swett&#8217;s book is a fascinating look at the advertising and consumer industries during the Third Reich.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Marriage is the foundation of a successful society,&#8221; proclaimed the Clinton-era welfare reform bill. Since then, national and state governments have spent nearly a billion dollars on programs designed to encourage poor and low-income Americans to get married and to remain married. But do any of these initiatives achieve their stated goals?

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There may not be a more ubiquitous presence on American highways than the truck. The images are iconic: eighteen-wheelers with muddy steel and chrome, and a driver in aviator sunglasses and a mesh hat. But as <a href="https://www.steveviscelli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Viscelli</a>, political sociologist and lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania, shows in his new book, <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QsF_U8zkHT0IBNEGImgs4_gAAAFfpuvFNwEAAAFKAS47Tzo/http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520278127/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=0520278127&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=iFivyRc7uGpHc3Yqzry0PA&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Big Rig: Trucking and the Decline of the American Dream</a> (<a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520278127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of California Press</a>, 2016), the romantic idea of the hardworking, solitary truck driver making a decent, honest living for his family must be laid to rest. Once among the best blue-collar jobs in the country with one of the strongest labor unions, the deregulation and subsequent greedy practices of the trucking industry turned it into a &#8220;bad&#8221; one, with very low pay, very long and unpredictable hours, and awful work conditions. Aware of these realities, the trucking industry does a masterful job of creating and maintaining the illusion that being a truck driver is still a path toward upward mobility, an honest and true working-class version of the American Dream. They structure work so that workers play a &#8220;miles game&#8221; of always trying to maximize time for a little extra pay, and push the allure of becoming an independent contractor, which only indebts them to their company. Becoming a trucker himself, Viscelli vividly shows his own frustrations in training and out on the road, caught up in the game and hearing stories of workers who haven&#8217;t seen their families in weeks and are still struggling to make ends meet. Through an illuminating case, Viscelli addresses the timeless questions: &#8220;Why do people work bad jobs?&#8221; and &#8220;Why do they stay in them for as long as they do?&#8221; His answers get at the heart not just of a single occupation and industry, but also of work in today&#8217;s economy.<br />

In this interview, <a href="http://carlodippoliti.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlo D&#8217;Ippoliti</a>, one of the three co-editors, discusses with us why a handbook of heterodox economics was needed. Contributions throughout the handbook explore different theoretical perspectives including: Marxian-radical political economics; Post Keynesian-Sraffian economics; institutionalist-evolutionary economics; feminist economics; social economics; Regulation theory; the Social Structure of Accumulation approach; and ecological economics. Several contributions explain the structural properties and dynamics of capitalism, as well as propose economic and social policies for the benefit of the majority of the population. This book aims, firstly, to provide realistic and coherent theoretical frameworks to understand the capitalist economy in a constructive and forward-looking manner. Secondly, it delineates the future directions, as well as the current state, of heterodox economics. Both graduate students and academics will enjoy reading it. The interview ends with Carlo D&#8217;Ippoliti arguing in favour of a more pluralist approach to economics in research, teaching and policymaking.<br />

As Briski explains in this podcast, while beer has been consumed since at least as early as Sumerian times, it wasn&#8217;t until the addition of hops as a preservative by brewers in Europe during the Middle Ages that beer became commercially viable. The development of the industry reflected more general trends, from the economies of scale that took place during the Industrial Revolution to the impact of television on small brewers in the United States in the mid-20th century. Today the industry is characterized both by a few multinational conglomerates and numerous craft brewers whose products provide a diverse counterpoint from the mass-produced lagers of the large companies. Briski reveals how these products reflect the different trends of consumption throughout the world, from the increased focus upon quality consumption in the United States and western Europe to the rapid expansion of beer consumption in places like Russia, China, and Brazil.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The government of the Philippines has for decades encouraged its citizens to seek work abroad and send money back to the country in remittances. But in recent years it has increasingly sought to entice Filipinos who have settled abroad to come home, not only for tourism but also for retirement.

Pido</a> travels with Filipino Americans as they try to reimagine their lives and lifestyles in the gated communities and malls of Manila, and beyond. Along the way he encounters real estate agents, bureaucrats, investors and family members of returnees, or balikbayan, all in one way or another participating in attempts at selling an idea of home, one that for balikbayan from the US in particular evokes feelings both of homecoming and of a homeliness that they associate with their years spent on the other side of the Pacific.<br />
Eric J. Pido joins <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/southeast-asian-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in Southeast Asian Studies</a> to talk about histories of departing from and returning to the Philippines, segregated suburbs and walled megacities, the balikbayan economy, returning migrants&#8217; anxieties and hopes, medical tourism, and 1950s nostalgia.<br />

This book marries together important questions within political theory, feminist theory, and economics with specific focus on the idea of subject and how an individual subject may be poised towards action, particularly in context of moving towards a more equitable political and economic system. Leeb&#8217;s book, which theorizes about the contested nature of the political subject, explores the concept of the political subject in outline as she has titled this theory. This reinterpretation of the political subject is as an incomplete political subject, given the contested interpretations of this concept in political theory, feminist theory, and psychological theory.<br />
The text goes on to examine key political and feminist theorists in framing the positioning of the political subject, putting Marx, Adorno, and Lacan and other Frankfurt School theorists into conversation with feminist theorists. Leeb, as a result of theorizing the capacity for action by the political subject in outline, explores the tension between theory and practice, noting this mediated relationship, and delving into why there is such tension between theory and practice, especially within the academe. The issue of transformative agency, especially a kind of intersectional transformative agency that integrates both feminist and economic impulses, is at the center of Leeb&#8217;s analysis and presses on some of the limits of theory as disconnected from the practice of politics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

It&#8217;s about how, in the 1930s and 40s, a group of reformers in the US and in Mexico undertook projects to transform the rural worlds of their respective countries in the name of social justice and agrarian productivity. Olsson demonstrates how closely the histories of Mexico and the American South in particular paralleled one another, and how parallel histories yielded parallel problems, including mass rural poverty, landlessness, and economic deprivation. Whether in Mississippi or Michoacan, Tennessee or Tabasco, the rural masses saw few tangible benefits in the economic miracle heralded by boosters in Atlanta and Mexico City, Professor Olsson writes. And so in that decade historians sometimes like to call the long 1930s, Mexican and US reformers crossed the border again and again, to share models and ideas, and to undertake projects of rural revitalization through varying methods and with varying results. Olsson&#8217;s book recovers a world in which like-minded Mexicans and Americans worked together, toward what they hoped would be a more just world, in concert and in solidarity. Tore C. Olsson is Assistant Professor of History at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On September 3, 1991, a fire erupted at the Imperial Foods factory in the small town of Hamlet, North Carolina. Twenty-five people died behind the factory&#8217;s locked doors that morning. Most of the victims were women, and about half of them were black. In <a href="http://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QlV-p9JaxyayflyhWFhd4VUAAAFe8fNJogEAAAFKAczbFG4/http://www.amazon.com/dp/1620972387/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1620972387&amp;linkCode=w61&amp;imprToken=NxUsBoyGVlGVQ6685-r1Mg&amp;slotNum=0&amp;tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hamlet Fire: A Tragic Story of Cheap Food, Cheap Government, and Cheap Lives</a> (<a href="http://thenewpress.com/books/hamlet-fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Press</a>, 2017), Temple University history professor <a href="http://www.cla.temple.edu/history/faculty/bryant-simon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bryant Simon</a> lays out the structural failures in the American and global economic systems which killed those workers. As economic growth slowed and inflation rose in the 1970s, many Americans grew disillusioned with the New Deal era promise of high wages and a robust regulatory state. Instead, Simon argues, Americans began to embrace a culture of cheap, ready-made, products and government policies which benefitted business owners, rather than employees. Food sat high atop the list of cheap items Americans craved, particularly chicken which, just before the Hamlet fire, surpassed beef as the meat most commonly consumed by American diners. It was no coincidence that the Imperial plant in Hamlet processed chicken strips and tenders for sale at national chain grocery stores. Nor was it a coincidence that Imperial relocated to North Carolina in the 1980s, as the state defunded regulatory systems and opened its doors to businesses looking for any edge in a hyper competitive market. The Hamlet Fire is a remarkable and ultimately sad story about the hidden costs of American consumption and global systems of production at the end of the twentieth century.<br />

Focusing on the workers of the Pilbara, Ellem argues that despite the region&#8217;s history of unionism, the significant power-grab by companies in the 1980s meant that the great mining boom of the early 21st century favored company profits over union prophets.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

With British industry facing growing competition abroad, successive governments in the 1960s and 1970s sought investment capital in order to maintain that sector&#8217;s viability. Efforts were made to encourage institutional investors such as pension and insurance funds to devote more of their industrial investment to long-term development rather than short-term profit, while many on the left of the Labour Party in the 1970s advocated nationalizing the banks as a means of channeling resources into the sector. Such proposals, however, were countered with calls to liberalize and deregulate the financial sector, many of which were advanced by trade associations and other bodies within the financial sector whose growing influence reflected the increasing importance of the City both as a part of the economy and within national politics. Their success in resisting intervention, Davies concludes, presaged the market-driven approach pursued by Margaret Thatcher&#8217;s Conservative government after 1979, one which continues to define British policy down to the present day.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

With the rising global demand for cotton &#8211; and thus, slaves &#8211; in the 1840s and 1850s, the need for white laborers in the American South was drastically reduced, creating a large underclass who were unemployed or underemployed. These poor whites could not compete &#8211; for jobs or living wages &#8211; with profitable slave labor. Though impoverished whites were never subjected to the daily violence and degrading humiliations of racial slavery, they did suffer tangible socio-economic consequences as a result of living in a slave society. The author examines how these &#8216;masterless&#8217; men and women threatened the existing Southern hierarchy and ultimately helped push Southern slaveholders toward secession and civil war.<br />
<a href="http://www.kerileighmerritt.com">Keri Leigh Merritt</a> is an independent scholar from Atlanta, Georgia. She received her B.A. in History and Political Science from Emory University, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in History from the University of Georgia. Her research generally focuses on race and class in American history. Merritt&#8217;s work on poverty and inequality has garnered multiple awards, and she also writes historical pieces for the public, with letters and essays appearing in Aeon, on <a href="http://www.billmoyers.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BillMoyers.com</a>, and in The New York Times.<br />
In addition to Masterless Men, Merritt has a forthcoming co-edited book on southern labor history with University of West Georgia historian Matthew Hild tentatively titled Reviving Southern Labor History: Race, Class, and Power. She is also currently conducting research for two additional book-length projects; the first is on black resistance in the vastly understudied Reconstruction era, and the second project examines the changing role of law enforcement in the mid-nineteenth century south. Masterless Men: Poor Whites in the Antebellum South is her first book.<br />

In the wake of increased insecurity due to the rise of anti-Muslim sentiments and policy, Islamic-branded products have become an essential means for shaping and expressing social identities. The commodification of a religious orientation has produced a halal consumerism that pervades the branding and marketing logic of several industries. In our conversation we discuss the corporatization of the halal food industry, Islamic products and non-Muslim publics, the politics of slaughtering animals, Islamic branded toys, such as hijabi dolls, cosmetic and toiletry products, and the Muslim fashion industry.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The relationship between religion and economic activity has attracted generations of scholars working in myriad settings. In recent years, many have turned to questions of how Islamic ideas are generative of economic activity, to Islamic finance and capital, and to the relationship between contemporary Islam and capitalism more broadly. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Islam-Sharia-Modern-Workplace/dp/1107184320/">Corporate Islam: Sharia and the Modern Workplace</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2017), <a href="http://sites.udel.edu/sloanewhite/">Patricia Sloane-White</a> builds on this work by asking &#8220;not only how the spread of global capitalism transforms the lives of Muslims&#8230; but how capitalism empowers the spread of Islam.&#8221; Drawing from interviews and ethnographic fieldwork over a seven-year period, and a wealth of knowledge from over two decades of research in Malaysia, Sloane-White argues that the &#8220;sharia space&#8221; of the today&#8217;s corporate Islamic workplace is a third domain between the public and the private in which employees must submit to the guidance of their professional and personal lives by men who insist that their businesses can and must be both profitable and pious.<br />
Patricia Sloane-White joins <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/southeast-asian-studies/">New Books in Southeast Asian Studies</a> to talk about Malaysia&#8217;s self-styled men of the mosque and the market; the new nexus between Islamic scholars and CEOs; the decline of the bumiputera generation; sexuality, gendered divisions of labour, and the problem of patriarchy in the capitalist workplace everywhere.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[To remember Nathaniel Bowditch today primarily for his famous navigational textbook is to acknowledge only one of his many achievements. As <a href="http://history.buffalo.edu/faculty/thornton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara Plakins Thornton</a> demonstrates in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469626934/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathaniel Bowditch and the Power of Numbers: How a Nineteenth-Century Man of Business, Science, and the Sea Changed American Life</a> (<a href="https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469626932/nathaniel-bowditch-and-the-power-of-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of North Carolina Press</a>, 2016), Bowditch&#8217;s legacy is one that endures in a surprising range of fields. The son of a luckless merchant captain, Bowditch grew up in the early years of the new republic. At an early age he was apprenticed at a young age to a ship&#8217;s chandler, which introduced him to the world of maritime commerce. His aptitude for mathematics led him to identify numerous errors in the standard navigational text he used while on commercial voyages, and his revisions established the book colloquially known by his name today. Yet this was only at the beginning of a long and prosperous career in business, as he moved from commerce to insurance and banking. As Thornton explains, Bowditch&#8217;s mathematically-honed passion for order and precision was employed to systematize traditionally irregular business practices in ways that are reflected in the modern workplace, while his use of trusts to preserve family fortunes ensured the perpetuation of an entire New England social class. Such was his success that Bowditch became one of the Brahmin elite of nineteenth-century Boston society, while his achievements in mathematics and astronomy helped to make him a national icon by the time of his death.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The new German Democratic Republic, known as East Germany, faced many challenges when it was founded in 1949. Not least of which was convincing its citizens that they should be loyal to the new state and mobilizing the population towards its ideological goals. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0472119133/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The People&#8217;s Own Landscape: Nature, Tourism and Dictatorship in East Germany</a> (<a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/4573218/peoples_own_landscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Michigan Press</a>, 2014), <a href="http://www2.cortland.edu/departments/history/faculty-staff-detail.dot?fsid=%20263197" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scott Moranda</a> explores how the Socialist Unity Party (SED) attempted to use tourism and landscape planning to reshape East Germans&#8217; definition of their homeland. He also demonstrates the messy boundaries between state and society, in which East Germans refused to change patterns of pre-World War II nature activities such as hiking and camping; conservationists and the regime found common ground on concepts of landscape management; and environmentalism resulted in a fundamental break between society and the state. The People&#8217;s Landscape contributes to our understanding of East Germany&#8217;s environmental history as well as to our understanding of the nuances of the relationship between state and society under dictatorships.<br />

The core of the book is the idea of aspirational labour, which captures the demands of trying to get in and get on in this precarious form of work. Aspirational labour is theorised in conjunction with gender and the broader inequalities of production and consumption in consumer culture. The book then uses this frame to explore the big winners of the social media economy, alongside detailing the hidden costs to being authentic and effortless online, as well as reflecting on the impact of aspirational labour on many other areas of economy and society. The book is packed with rich and detailed interview data, and is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand contemporary consumer culture.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Is Marx still relevant? Any social scientist will answer with a resounding yes! In what he refers to as a thought experiment, <a href="https://uwm.edu/political-science/people/ascher-ivan/">Ivan Ascher</a> uses Marx to understand the financial market. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1935408747/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portfolio Society: A Capitalist Mode of Prediction </a>(Zone Books, 2016), Ascher focuses on the arc and narratives found in Capital, using them to analyze risk, credit, and the financial market downfall of 2008. Ascher encourages the reader to explore how we might be able to understand what is going on today by looking back at Marx&#8217;s understanding of capitalism. The reader will come across familiar characters, like moneybags and vampires, and familiar concepts from Marx, like fetishism and co-dependence within the market. The nice thing about this book is that you do not need prior knowledge of Marx or financial markets, though those who have knowledge of either or both will still find great pleasure in this thought experiment.<br />
This book would be enjoyed by sociologists or political scientists in general, alongside those interested in financial markets. It would be especially useful in a theory course where students could make connections between Marx and Ascher&#8217;s narratives.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Dominant social norms and expectations shape how individuals and their public activities are understood. In Roman antiquity, various shifts influenced the production and dissolution of prejudices towards certain types of occupations. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0472130080/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trade and Taboo: Disreputable Professions in the Roman Mediterranean</a> (University of Michigan Press, 2016), <a href="https://sarahemilybond.com/">Sarah Bond</a>, Assistant Professor of Classics at the University of Iowa, explores the legal, social, and literary modes of persecution and stigmatization of unseemly occupations and voluntary associations. One&#8217;s membership in Roman society was often regulated through reputation and social position. Criers, funerary workers, and tanners were among the many trades that were viewed as unwholesome, marginalizing these individuals from the broader community. Over time there were shifts in social perceptions of certain types of work, often catalyzed by religious communities. In our discussion we talked about taboos as an analytical category, reading soundscapes in ancient texts, views of death, corpses, and pollution, the social context of tanners and their odors, mint workers and state labor, bakers and sensual trades, gladiators, archeological topography, the role of Christian and Jewish communities in shaping social norms, and maybe surprisingly, rednecks, the field of Classics, blogging, how to do good public scholarship, the Women of Ancient History database, and how walls embody emotions of fear.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Labor markets are not what they used to be, as <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~anthro/people/faculty/igershon.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ilana Gershon</a> argues in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022645214X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Down and Out in the New Economy: How People Find (or Don&#8217;t Find) Work Today </a>(<a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo25799564.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Chicago Press</a>, 2017). Job seekers are increasingly being taught that they need to sell themselves as if they were their own business, and what will set them apart from other applicants is not their skills or their experience, but the distinctiveness of their brand. Join us for a provocative discussion about how workers are being taught to position themselves to employers, and how modern labor markets, as a consequence, differ from those in the past &#8212; and why that matters.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We are accustomed to the thought that individuals facing dire circumstances may rightfully take use of others&#8217; property in order to save their own lives. For example, one thinks it obvious that in order to avoid freezing to death, a lost mountain hiker may rightfully break into and make use of a heated cabin that is not his property. But what justifies this idea? And what are its implications for a world where millions are subjected to sustained and systematic depravation?

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822363283/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Space of Boredom: Homelessness in the Slowing Global Order </a>(Duke University Press, 2017) <a href="http://slu.academia.edu/BruceONeill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bruce O&#8217;Neill</a> explores how people cast aside by globalism deal with an intractable symptom of downward mobility: an unshakeable and immense boredom. Focusing on Bucharest, Romania, where the 2008 financial crisis compounded the failures of the postsocialist state to deliver on the promises of liberalism, O&#8217;Neill shows how the city&#8217;s homeless are unable to fully participate in a society that is increasingly organized around practices of consumption. Without a job to work, a home to make, or money to spend, the homeless&#8212;who include pensioners abandoned by their families and the state&#8212;struggle daily with the slow deterioration of their lives. O&#8217;Neill moves between homeless shelters and squatter camps, black labor markets and transit stations, detailing the lives of men and women who manage boredom by seeking stimulation, from conversation and coffee to sex in public restrooms or going to the mall or IKEA. Showing how boredom correlates with the downward mobility of Bucharest&#8217;s homeless, O&#8217;Neill theorizes boredom as an enduring affect of globalization in order to provide a foundation from which to rethink the politics of alienation and displacement.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[We are nearly a decade removed from the start of the Great Recession, and many indicators show that the economy is doing relatively well. But during this economic catastrophe, a significant number of people faced long-term unemployment, especially in the manufacturing sector. Jobs that were once the picture of stability and security, and that helped form a vibrant post-war middle class in the United States, disappeared as companies downsized, outsourced, and retooled.<br />
In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520283015/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cut Loose: Jobless and Hopeless in an Unfair Economy </a>(University of California Press, 2015), Assistant Professor of Sociology <a href="https://victortanchen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Tan Chen </a>examines former autoworkers&#8212;perhaps the most iconic of blue-collar American jobs&#8212;and their experiences with long-term unemployment. Upon getting laid off from their jobs, these workers confront a completely different labor market from what they were used to. No longer can they succeed based solely on hard work&#8212;the idea of meritocracy that they have all embraced as an ideal. They learn about the higher education they need, the soft skills many jobs require, the social networks they lack, and the constant self-branding workers must now do. Believing in meritocracy, and in society&#8217;s widespread culture of judgment, these workers come to blame themselves for their shortcomings and failure to adapt to the realities of today&#8217;s economy. Their lives spiral downward as they cope with strained familial relationships, personal mental illness, and a society that has tossed them aside while simultaneously saying they are to blame for their own problems. Fascinatingly, Chen finds that these conditions and consequences mostly hold true for autoworkers in Canada, which is often lauded for its stronger and broader social safety net, as it does in the United States. With great empathy and astute analysis, Cut Loose shows the human side of economic transformations bereft of sound public policies and collectivist strategies<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What comes to mind when you think of Paris in the nineteenth century? For me, its revolutionary politics, the circulation of increasing numbers of people and goods, a range of spectacular cultural displays and amusements, an emergent urban modernity including a host of negotiations between social classes, public and private, men and women, citizens and the state. And if I had to name one historical figure to stand for the transformation of the nineteenth-century capital? Haussmann. Hands down.<br />
<a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/alexia.yates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexia Yates</a>&#8216;s book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674088212/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Selling Paris: Property and Commercial Culture in the Fin-de-siecle</a> Capital (Harvard UP, 2015), opened my eyes to a whole other world of everyday urbanism and historical actors in the city during the first decades of the Third Republic. Acknowledging the undeniable impact of Haussmann and Haussmannization on the city that Paris became under and after the Second Empire, Selling Paris considers the activities, interests, and effects of a host of other figures who shaped the city&#8217;s property relations and commercial culture from the early years of the Third Republic to the First World War. In the books chapters, readers will find a social history of the business of French building during this period, from planning and production to use. Focused on the architects, private developers, municipal authorities, speculators, real estate agents, notaries, property owners, and tenants whose interactions and negotiations influenced the form, representation, and experience of Parisian real estate in purposeful ways, the book makes significant contributions to our understanding of the history of the capital and capitalism in France.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There are as many New Deals as there are books on the subject. Yet only recently have historians begun to dig into the international dimensions of the New Deal. <a href="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.patel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiran Klaus Patel</a> is one of those historians, and his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691149127/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New Deal: A Global History</a> (Princeton University Press, 2016), is an impressive crack at showing the transnational intertwinements and comparisons that made up the New Deal&#8217;s moment. Patel locates the United States in a vast network of modernizing states who experienced a shared crisis in the years after 1929, developed national policies to address the crisis, and looked to other states in search of inspiration or out of fear. As late as 1938, for instance, Roosevelt was requesting Nazi labor statistics to help refine his own administrations planning. Patel shows how the New Deal shaped the world and, more importantly, was shaped by the world.<br />
The book provides fresh contributions to a range of different topics, such as the global Great Depression, the Good Neighbor Policy, the development of the welfare state, interwar international relations, and American post-WWII globalism. Kiran Klaus Patel, Professor of European and Global History at Maastricht University, achieves this with a knowledge of secondary literature in a variety of languages and rich archival evidence. The result of Patel&#8217;s work is a New Deal that looks a lot less exceptional, yet no less important to global history.<br />

Dexter Fergie will be pursuing his PhD in US and Global history at Northwestern University in September 2017.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Now and then we feature a book on <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/southeast-asian-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in Southeast Asian Studies</a> whose author we ought to have had on the show some time ago. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0824836537/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Perfect Business? Anti-Trafficking and the Sex Trade Along the Mekong </a>(University of Hawaii Press, 2012) is one such book. <a href="https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/molland-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sverre Molland</a> wrote his tandem ethnography of traffickers and anti-traffickers while researching on the border of Thailand and Laos in the 2000s, after a stint in an anti-trafficking project in which the incongruities of identifying and criminalizing alleged human traffickers became all too obvious to him. Bringing an anthropological lens to the juridical and economic categories that are usually deployed both to explain and address the phenomenon of trafficking for sex, Molland shows that the premises on which anti-trafficking programs operate are unsound. The movement of women and girls in and out of the sex trade is deeply socially embedded. Only by attending to the many varied ways that recruitment into the trade occurs can it be understood. With that, moralizing and paternalistic projects for trafficking&#8217;s elimination, as well as indicator projects for its enumeration, might be set to one side, and replaced with other ways of knowing and dealing with the phenomenon that might be rather more sensible, if less aspirational.<br />
Sverre Molland joins <a href="http://newbooksnetwork.com/category/southeast-asian-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Books in Southeast Asian Studies</a> to talk about the many layers of deception and consent in sex work, bad faith among traffickers and anti-traffickers, the misguidance of the market metaphor, teens trading teens, agency, structural violence, and the trend towards privately funded anti-trafficking and anti-slavery projects in Southeast Asia.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[A big question in Sociology regarding work and gender is: which mothers opt out of the labor force to take care of children? Popularly known as &#8220;opting out,&#8221; this trend is often seen as a mother&#8217;s personal choice rather than a decision made within a set of cultural and structural constraints in women&#8217;s everyday lives. Building upon previous work, <a href="https://www.popcenter.umd.edu/mprc-associates/lclandivar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liana Christin Landivar</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1626376417/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mothers at Work: Who Opts Out? </a>(Lynne Rienner Publishers, 2017) uses nationally representative data to inquire into who exactly is opting out and who is staying in the labor force. Most media coverage on the topic focuses on women who work in management or other professional level occupations, but Landivar&#8217;s book looks at a wide spectrum of occupations and finds that the question of who opts out is much more nuanced. She finds that investigating occupation is key for answering who is opting out. She also delves into the categorizations of work hours, giving consideration not only to part-time work and how that varies by occupation, but also women who scale back, or reduce work hours but not to part-time levels. Additionally, age of the mother, as well as the child, alongside race and educational attainment all help to better understand which mothers are opting out. Landivar gives careful consideration to the structural factors across and between occupations and how they may influence mothers opting out. Finally, this book provides some important methodological insights for the reader, including emphasizing the variations within work hours and the key importance of reference groups used to answer research questions.<br />
This book will be enjoyed by Sociologists broadly, but is key reading for work/family and gender scholars. Folks in gender studies as well as business leaders might enjoy this book and find important insights into which mothers opt out of the labor force. This book would be useful in a gender/work/family class as well as a graduate level methods course, with its careful explanation of modeling and fantastic graphics.<br />

If the thought of calculus makes you nervous, don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t need calculus to enjoy and appreciate this book. Its actually an intriguing way to introduce some of the precalculus topics that will later be needed in a calculus class, through the examination of some of the basic mathematical ideas that can be used to analyze the problems of how to attain relationship bliss, live long, and prosper and all without being a Vulcan.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

A provocative, fascinating and deeply detailed study, the book is sure the shake up existing scholarship on the topic.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Readers will want to grab a cocktail and charcuterie board when they sit down to read <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/faculty/richard-e-ocejo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Richard E. Ocejo</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691165491/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masters of Craft: Old Jobs in the New Urban Economy</a> (Princeton University Press, 2017). Ocejo explores the performance of culture through food and drink choices as well as the rejection of mass production in craft jobs. Working in the field, Ocejo provides readers with a glimpse into the working lives of bartenders, distillery workers, butchers and barbers. Highly educated and seeking meaning in their work, more young men are moving into these traditional jobs that have turned high end. Oceojo paints a sociological landscape of work and meaning in these jobs as well as understanding around &#8220;good jobs&#8221; in the new economy. Through technical skills as well as cultural understanding, we see how these workers not only support each other in each niche community, but also help teach the customers about these ways of life. Questioning our ideas about social mobility and what is a &#8220;good job,&#8221; Ocejo provides insight into stratification of tastes as well as the gentrification of jobs.<br />
This book would be useful in an upper level undergraduate or even graduate course in Work and Occupations, and will be enjoyed by sociologist, economists, and cocktail drinkers alike.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/146963189X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Goodwill to Grunge: A History of Secondhand Styles and Alternative Economies</a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2017), historian <a href="http://www.jenniferlezotte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Le Zotte</a> examines the movement of selling secondhand goods for profit and charity. Focusing on thrift stores, flea markets, and garage sales, Le Zotte traces the history of selling used goods and clothing, from its questionable start to becoming a multimillion dollar business. In From Goodwill to Grunge, Le Zotte traces the origins of secondhand style as a political, economic, and social act. She explores the ways in which both conservative and progressive activists used secondhand clothing for political and economic gains. Starting in the early 1900s and progressing through the 1990s grunge rock scene, Le Zotte shows how buying secondhand clothing was an act of rebellion and empowerment for drag queens and war protestors as well as the use of rummage sales for religious and political activism for church groups and civil rights organizations. Extensively researched, Le Zotte&#8217;s contribution to research into fashion and secondhand makes for enjoyable and informative reading that grounds secondhand markets in a variety of popular cultural spaces.<br />

In its aim to collect taxes and minimize tax faults, the Agency mediates the application of tax law to ensure compliance and maintain legitimacy in society. This volume follows one risk assessment project&#8217;s passage through the Agency, from its inception, through the research phase, in discussions with management to its final abandonment. With its fiscal anthropological approach, Shaping Taxpayers reveals how diverse knowledge claims&#8211;legal, economic, cultural&#8211;compete to shape taxpayer behaviour.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.fas.harvard.edu/people/lizabeth-cohen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lizabeth Cohen</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107431794/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making A New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919-1939 </a>was originally published in 1990, and recently re-published in 2014. In this book, Cohen explores how it was that Chicago workers, who could not overcome ethnic and racial divisions during a wave of failed strikes in 1919, came together in the mid to late-1930s across ethnic and racial lines &#8220;to make a New Deal&#8221; for themselves and their fellow laborers. They made that &#8220;New Deal&#8221; as members of national labor unions and a national Democratic Party. These successes were possible because of community and cultural changes that took place in the 1920s, Cohen argues. During that decade, ethnic and race-based community organizations, new institutions of mass culture like chain stores and movie theaters, and employers&#8217; &#8220;welfare capitalist&#8221; programs all vied for workers attention and loyalty. Paradoxically, the very programs employers hoped would prevent the growth of unions actually helped break down ethnic and racial barriers, building upon new experiences of shared consumerism. As the Great Depression unfolded, workers managed to form the cross-race and cross-ethnic alliances that had alluded them in 1919 and the early 1920s. Union organizers succeeded in building a new culture of unity and achieving new levels of organization and worker power. Industrial laborers and their unions challenged their employers to live up to the &#8220;welfare capitalism&#8221; they had promised in the years before the financial crisis. As their level of organization grew, Chicago workers also became New Deal Democrats invested in national politics. The new edition includes an updated preface by the author.<br />
Lizabeth Cohen serves as the Howard Mumford Jones Professor of American Studies at Harvard University, as well as the Dean of Harvard&#8217;s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[A profoundly humane look at an inhumane institution, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807047627/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Price for Their Pound of Flesh: The Value of the Enslaved, from Womb to Grave, in the Building of a Nation </a>(Beacon Press, 2017) will have a major impact how we think about slavery, reparations, capitalism, nineteenth-century medical education, and the value of life and death. Slaves were commodities, their monetary value assigned based on their age, gender, health, and the demands of the market. This is the first book to explore the economic value of enslaved people through every phase of their lives including preconception, infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, the senior years, and death in the early American domestic slave trade.<br />
Covering the full life cycle, <a href="http://www.drdainarameyberry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historian and author</a> <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/faculty/db27553" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daina Ramey Berry</a> shows the lengths to which enslavers would go to maximize profits and protect their investments. Illuminating ghost values or the prices placed on dead enslaved people, Berry also explores the little-known domestic cadaver trade and traces the illicit sales of dead bodies to medical schools. This book is the culmination of more than ten years of Berry&#8217;s exhaustive research on enslaved values, drawing on data unearthed from sources such as slave-trading records, insurance policies, cemetery records, and life insurance policies. Writing with sensitivity and depth, Ramey Berry resurrects the voices of the enslaved and provides a rare window into enslaved people&#8217;s experiences and thoughts, revealing how enslaved people recalled and responded to being appraised, bartered, and sold throughout the course of their lives.<br />
Daina Ramey Berry is an associate professor of history and African and African diaspora studies, and the Oliver H. Radkey Regents Fellow in History at the University of Texas at Austin. An award-winning historian, she is also a Distinguished Lecturer for the Organization of American Historians. Dr. Berry&#8217;s research interests include 19th century American History, Comparative Slavery, and Southern History, with a particular emphasis on the role of gender, labor, family, and economy among the enslaved. Her previous book-length works include Slavery and Freedom in Savannah, Enslaved Women in America: An Encyclopedia, and Swing the Sickle for the Harvest is Ripe: Gender and Slavery in Antebellum Georgia. Ramey Berry also appeared on the first season finale of the NBC series Who Do You Think You Are? she assisted Hollywood legend Spike Lee in tracing his family ancestry with some very surprising results.<br />

Balleisen is associate professor of history and public policy and vice provost of Interdisciplinary Studies at Duke University. Why is fraud committed so frequently in the United States? What about our political and legal institutions has created such an inviting environment for tricksters? And, what has government done to address it?

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://mord.mona.uwi.edu/staff/view.asp?pid=12131" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave Gosse&#8217;s</a> recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/9766402698/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abolition and Plantation Management in Jamaica, 1807-1838</a> (University of the West Indies Press, 2012), looks at a crucial period in Jamaican history. The time between the abolition of Britain&#8217;s slave trade in 1807 and the end of slavery and the apprenticeship system in 1838 saw dramatic attempts by plantation owners and managers to continue grinding profit out of their enslaved workers. Gosse takes on previous assumptions about the efficiency and success of those planters and overseers, by arguing that Jamaican management in this period was largely a failure. Not only did the business culture on plantations encourage negligence, and sometimes theft, but those supervising enslaved workers made little attempt to ameliorate their condition. This exacerbated illness, mortality, and encouraged enslaved Jamaicans to push back. The book brings new perspectives on the end of a brutal and exploitative period in Jamaican history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the forty years between 1881 and 1921, the United States Navy went from a small force focused on coastal defense to one of the world&#8217;s largest fleets. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1682470776/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Congress Buys a Navy: Politics, Economics, and the Rise of American Naval Power, 1881-1921</a> (Naval Institute Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.usni.org/author/paul-e-pedisich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paul Pedisich</a> describes the role that the legislative branch played in making this happen. At the start of the period, the Navy possessed a more decentralized organization than today, with the bureau chiefs who ran it more responsive to Congress than the executive branch. The legislators who played critical roles in shaping policy during this period were often driven more by local concerns than any overarching vision of what the Navy should become. Starting in the 1880s, however, successive presidential administrations gradually persuaded Congress to provide more funding to build modern ships. Over time, America&#8217;s growing engagement in global affairs led to the expansion of the navy, as the acquisition of an overseas empire brought the United States into competition with European powers, which required a naval force that could defend the increasing number of American interests abroad.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Rahman is assistant professor of law at Brooklyn Law School. Combining perspectives from legal studies, political theory, and political science, Democracy Against Domination reinterprets Progressive Era economic thought for the challenges of today. The book offers a new approach to regulation and governance rooted in democratic theory and the writing of Louis Brandeis and John Dewey. In order to oversee complex economic activities and financial markets, Rahman argues for more democracy, not less, more participation by citizens and more participatory institutions established to facilitate this aim.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://goldwaterinstitute.org/en/authors/timothy-sandefur/" target="_blank">Timothy Sandefur&#8217;s</a> new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1594038392/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Permission Society: How the Ruling Class Turns Our Freedoms into Privileges and What We Can Do About It</a> (Encounter Books, 2016) is an argument against the restrictions on individual liberty by local, state and federal governments. Sandefur, the Vice President of Litigation at the Goldwater Institute, contends that the politics of the Progressive Era in America resulted in a faith in experts and empirical data that held the promise of a well-managed society. But Sandefur contends that such a well-intentioned effort resulted in laws that actually mismanaged many aspects of society and resulted in injustices. For example, the Civil Rights Movement was not only hindered by racism, but also by laws and regulations, such as licensure laws that raised barriers to entry in new trades and zoning laws that restricted affordable housing stock. Sandefur also reviews the importance of courts in recognizing and protecting individual liberties against such laws. Sandefur seeks to persuade readers that liberty from the ability to engage in business without significant costs mandated by the government, to the freedom to try experimental drugs that have not yet gained federal approval should not be regarded as a privilege bestowed by the government. Instead, he contends that liberty is a right possessed by all people regardless of their political or economic power.<br />

His book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0252081897/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Making of Working-Class Religion</a> (University of Illinois Press, 2016), gives us a rich and deep study of working class religion in Detroit beginning with the growth of industrialization in the 1910s. He examines the religious consciousness and attitudes toward work and the workplace in a diverse population of ethnic Catholic immigrants, African American Protestants and southern-born evangelicals that migrated to the city. Across religious affiliation, working class religion featured emotional expressiveness, belief in supernatural forces, and held to the sacred nature of work in the face of dehumanizing industrial conditions. Religion as individual expression and a site of social solidarity was in a dynamic relationship with the rise of labor unions across race, ethnic, and religious lines. Pehl highlights the tensions between clergy, workers, industrialists and union leaders in the meaning of work and religion and the practical application of social justice. The New Deal and the decline of unions replaced class-conscious religion with a race-conscious religious culture.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/074566251X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Age of Sharing</a> (Polity Press, 2016), the sociologist and media scholar <a href="http://nicholasjohn.huji.ac.il" target="_blank">Nicholas A. John</a> documents the history and current meanings of the word sharing, which he argues, is a central keyword of contemporary media discourse. John interrogates the rhetorical work that sharing does as a practice, a form of communication and a business model. He argues that in the last decade, sharing has come to dominate the way we think about our online activities, and indeed, the way we live. He demonstrates, how the therapeutic culture that defined the twentieth century, now shapes how we perceive and discuss our personal and economic interactions both online and offline. Moreover, it was the therapeutic discourse that informed and energized the shift from sharing as a distributive practice of material objects to the ethos of sharing as caring. John combines a close analysis of social media sites such as Facebook and businesses such Airbnb with a linguistic analysis of the genealogy of the concept of sharing, the unknown history of Alcoholics Anonymous, and the subculture of hackers to explain the ascent of sharing as a daily practice and coveted social currency.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[One of the most interesting questions of modern history is this: Why is it that Communist China was able to make a successful transition to economic modernity (and with it prosperity) while the Communist Soviet Union was not? In his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1469630176/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Struggle to Save the Soviet Economy: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the USSR</a> (UNC Press, 2016), <a href="http://iss.yale.edu/people/christopher-miller">Chris Miller</a> offers a convincing explanation for the divergent paths of these two Marxist-Leninist powers. Miller shows that Mikhail Gorbachev knew well about the on-going Chinese experiment, and he modeled much of what he attempted to do on it. Yet, as Miller argues, Gorbachev faced much stiffer political and ideological opposition than the Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, did. In the USSR, the Party was stronger and there were powerful institutional-economic interests standing in his way. In addition, Soviet socialism had &#8220;worked&#8221; for masses of ordinary citizens in a way that Chinese socialism had not; many &#8220;Soviet people&#8221; believed in the Soviet system and were very skeptical about the idea of adopting a new economic order. Caught between powerful elites and relatively satisfied regular folks, both of whom were beholden to the old ways, Gorbachev&#8217;s reforms didn&#8217;t really stand a chance.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The question of how we should act when facing something gravely immoral is a difficult one. This is particularly true when that immorality touches upon our everyday life. Such was the issue that Quakers, and others, faced with the question of goods produced by slaves. Was consuming goods, such as sugar or cotton clothing manufactured by slaves incompatible with abolitionism? Could the refusal to consume such goods contribute to the liberation of slaves? In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0801452082/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moral Commerce: Quakers and the Transatlantic Boycott of the Slave Labor Economy</a> (Cornell University Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/Museum_Studies/index.php?id=93250" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Julie Holcomb</a> focuses on abolitionists who answered yes to both of these questions. In this carefully researched and fascinating study, Holcomb examines the boycott movement in the Atlantic world, focusing on Britain and the United States, and ties together various discourses on race, religion, culture, and the economy. This book is particularly well suited for those interested in the history of abolitionism, but because of the wide variety of subjects it covers, virtually every reader can find something useful in it.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Although defined throughout his professional career as a development economist, Albert O. Hirschman&#8217;s intellectual scope defied classification. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691163499/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldly Philosopher: The Odyssey of Albert O. Hirschman</a> (Princeton University Press, 2013) <a href="https://history.princeton.edu/people/jeremy-adelman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeremy Adelman</a> describes the course of a restless thinker whose life intersected with some of the most important events and developments of the twentieth century. Born to a family of assimilated Jews, Hirschman grew up in the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. After the Nazi regime came to power Hirschman began an itinerant existence, gaining an education in economics from universities in three different countries. A passionate anti-fascist, he fought for the Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War and France in the Second World War. With the fall of France in 1940 he helped many of Europe&#8217;s leading artists and intellectuals escape from Nazi rule before emigrating to the United States himself. After wartime service in the OSS, Hirschman worked in the U.S. government on the postwar reconstruction of the European economy before moving to Colombia to serve as an advisor to the government there. His experiences in Latin America proved key to his emergence as a pioneer in the new field of development economics, which led to a succession of prestigious academic appointments. Yet as Adelman shows his readers, Hirschman&#8217;s interests were never confined to any one discipline, and his wide-ranging investigations led to works which often transcended disciplinary boundaries in the process of contributing to the intellectual discourse.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

How are software engineers managed? What are their goals and aspirations? How are they perceived by their foreign clients? In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199461481/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Reengineering India: Work, Capital, and Class in an Offshore Economy</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.nias.res.in/professor/carol-upadhya" target="_blank">Carol Upadhya</a> tackles these questions and many more. Based on extensive research in Bangalore &#8211; the large southern Indian metropolis that has led the IT buzz &#8211; the book explores the way capital, work and class are remade within the &#8220;new India.&#8221; Combining deep, rich and detailed accounts of life within &#8220;software factories&#8221; with a theoretical eclecticism and clear writing style, the book is a truly wonderful anthropological account of an offshore economy.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/marc-steinberg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Steinberg</a> is a professor of sociology at Smith College. His latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022632981X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">England&#8217;s Great Transformation: Law, Labor, and the Industrial Revolution</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2016) is a response to Karl Polyani&#8217;s vision of an emerging modern labor market in The Great Transformation. Steinberg complicates our understanding of changing power relations by examining how workers were contracted to their employers. The book is centered around three case studies of employers using draconian master-servant laws to control the labor force. Historically rigorous and sociologically imaginative, Steinberg&#8217;s analysis does true justice to the stories of his subjects.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0801456584/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Depths of Russia: Oil, Power, and Culture after Socialism</a> (Cornell University Press, 2015), <a href="http://anthropology.yale.edu/people/douglas-rogers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Douglas Rogers</a> discusses the role which oil, the precious resource hidden in the depths of the Earth, played in Perm&#8217;s story.<br />
Conceptually innovative, this book invites the readers to think about the co-production of natural resources and culture and the role state and corporation structures play in this process. In the Perm region, the Lukoil company has been adept at the production of new cultural identity of Perm as a vibrant post-industrial capital, and became the lead sponsor of historical and cultural revival of the city through its high-profile corporate social responsibility work.<br />
Douglas argues that Lukoil&#8217;s cultural activities helped to recast the Soviet-era identity formation patterns and facilitated Perm&#8217;s regaining its cultural authenticity and belonging after the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[For Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we hear from <a href="http://www.albany.edu/rockefeller/faculty_joint_strach.shtml" target="_blank">Patricia Strach</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190606851/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Hiding Politics in Plain Sight: Cause Marketing, Corporate Influence, and Breast Cancer Policymaking</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016). Strach holds a dual appointment in the Departments of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Albany, State University of New York.<br />
Hiding Politics in Plain Sight examines the politics of market mechanisms&#8211;especially cause marketing&#8211;as a strategy for public policy change. Strach shows that market mechanisms, like corporate-sponsored walks or cause-marketing, shift issue definition away from the contentious processes in the political sphere to the market, where advertising campaigns portray complex issues along a single dimension with a straightforward solution: breast cancer research will discover a cure and Americans can support this by purchasing specially-marked products. This market competition privileges even more specialized actors with business connections.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[On the podcast this week is <a href="http://www.iac.gatech.edu/people/faculty/amsterdam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Amsterdam</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812248104/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roaring Metropolis: Businessmen&#8217;s Campaign for a Civic Welfare State </a>(Penn Press, 2016). He is assistant professor in the School of History and Sociology at Georgia Institute of Technology. Many have claimed that we are living in a second Gilded Age, marked by the same extreme wealth and high levels of inequality as the early part of the previous century. Amsterdam takes us back to this time period to investigate how the Gilded Age addressed poverty and the role of the business community. Roaring Metropolis describes the rise of urban capitalists at the turn of the last century. Far from anti-government zealots, Amsterdam shows that business leaders pushed for extensive government spending on social programs. They advocated for public schooling, public health, the construction of libraries, museums, parks, and playgrounds. As Amsterdam demonstrates, public spending soared in American cities, especially Detroit, Philadelphia, and Atlanta, during the period due in part to businessmen&#8217;s political activism.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[With the recent economic collapse and rising income inequality, lessons drawn from turn-of-the century capitalism have become frequent. Pundits, policymakers, and others have looked to the era to find precursors to an unregulated market, corrupt bankers, and severe economic inequality. The comparisons are often too simple, however. In their new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190211652/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cotton Kings: Capitalism and Corruption in Turn-of-the-Century New York and New Orleans</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015), Barbara Hahn and Bruce Baker examine capitalism at the turn of the century, telling a more nuanced story about the cotton market, politics, and regulation. The Cotton Kings examines the ups and downs of the cotton futures market, explaining how cotton brokers were able to keep cotton prices low by controlling information. This enriched the brokers, but impoverished farmers. A small group of brokers in New Orleans successfully cornered the market in the early 1900s, in effect, self-regulating the cotton market and raising prices for years. The Cotton Kings traces the exciting story of this turn of events and explains why such self-regulation was not enough in the long run. Ultimately, The Cotton Kings makes a strong argument in favor of federal regulation to control corruption and help farmers and manufacturers alike.<br />
In this episode of the podcast, Hahn and Baker explain this cotton futures market and its ups and downs around the turn-of-the century. They also discuss some of the heroes and dramatic episodes of the historical moment. Finally, they discuss the lessons from that time for our present moment.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[During the 18th century English country houses served an important function in their society as stages for the display of the status and power of the landed aristocracy. As <a href="https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/hpp/staff/profile/index.php?profile_id=1233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jon Stobart</a> and <a href="http://www.northampton.ac.uk/directories/people/mark-rothery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Rothery</a> demonstrate in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198726260/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumption and the Country House</a>(Oxford University Press, 2016), though, they also played a revealing role as centers of consumption. Using three aristocratic families from the Midlands as case studies, Stobart and Rothery survey their patterns of spending over several generations, revealing the factors that shaped them. This spending, they argue, was not constant but instead saw fluctuations that coincided with life events, such as deaths and inheritances. Such dramatic changes were followed by the acquisition of goods that often were then used to create venues for these families to display their elite identity, with pursuit of the fashionable often tempered by issues of taste, rank and lineage. Stobart and Rothery&#8217;s analysis is not confined to large expenditures, however, as they also examine the more mundane spending necessary to keep these large households functioning and the gendered spheres that often defined the roles played by husband and wife in purchasing goods and services. Their analysis of these activities helps to refine our understanding of country houses, demonstrating how they were not the static exhibits we know today but fluid environments in which families left an ever-changing imprint.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Accounts of late-nineteenth-century US expansionism commonly refer to an open-door empire and an imperialism spurred by belief in free trade.

Instead, he notes, American adherents to Richard Cobden&#8217;s free-trade philosophy faced off against and ultimately lost to a powerful version of protectionist economic nationalism inspired by German-American economic theorist Friedrich List. The success of Listian protectionism spurred closed-door, aggressive US expansionism and also challenged free-trade orthodoxies in Britain, where political-economic policy also shifted toward protectionism by the end of the nineteenth century.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Two Canadian political science professors contend that the grotesque inequities of the capitalist system feed hatred, nourish misogyny, promote chronic dispossession and wreak havoc on the environment. In their new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1552667839/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Servant State: Overseeing Capital Accumulation in Canada</a>, (Fernwood, 2015), Geoffrey McCormack and Thom Workman, add that [o]nly when humanity moves beyond this system of social and natural exploitation will the well-being of all improve. Their book suggests, however, that moving beyond capitalism in advanced, industrial countries will not be easy since such states are ruled by governments that consistently serve the interests of the capitalist business class, helping it accumulate the machinery and equipment that are the means of capitalist production. They argue that the capitalist state also reinforces the coercive nature of capitalism with labour market policies designed to force workers into accepting jobs even if they&#8217;re poorly paid and insecure.<br />
In The Servant State, McCormack and Workman focus on how Canada weathered the global financial crisis of 2008. The book examines why Canada fared better economically than the U.S. and outlines the steps the Canadian government took to serve and protect capitalism during its latest crisis. Drawing on Marxian theory, the authors seek to move beyond what they describe as the smooth and oftentimes complacent discourse about Canadian capitalism to focus instead on the essential nature of the capitalist system. They write, this study embraces the spirit of rejection rather than indignation, the spirit of repudiation rather than conciliation. <a href="http://www.wheelock.edu/academics/faculty-and-administration/mccormack-geoffrey" target="_blank">Geoffrey McCormack </a>is assistant professor of political science at Wheelock College in Boston while <a href="http://www.unb.ca/fredericton/arts/departments/politicalscience/people/wworkman.html" target="_blank">Thom Workman</a> teaches in the political science department at the University of New Brunswick, Fredericton.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://soc.jhu.edu/directory/ho-fung-hung/" target="_blank">Ho-fung Hung</a>&#8216;s new book has two main goals: to to outline the historical origins of Chinas capitalist boom and the social and political formations in the 1980s that gave rise to this boom, and to explore the global effects of Chinas capitalist boom and the limit of that boom. In doing so, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0231164181/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The China Boom: Why China Will Not Rule the World</a> (Columbia UP, 2016) offers a timely and provocative account of the emergence and transformations of capitalism in modern China, and of the consequences of its entanglements with the rest of the world for the global political economy. In addition to an in-depth assessment of the Chinese economy, readers will find fascinating discussions of Chinas relations with Africa and Latin America, as well as some thoughtful comparative considerations. Hung&#8217;s book traces the rise of capitalism in China from the seventeenth century through today, and uses this historical grounding to point to possible futures. The China boom, Hung maintains, is destined to collapse.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Resistance to the industrial food system has, over the past decades, led to the rise of alternative food movements. Debate about genetically modified food, sugar consumption, fast food and the obesity crisis (to name a few) is pervasive. Most often, this focuses on individual consumer choice. <a href="http://garrettbroad.webflow.io/#About">Garrett M.Broad</a> argues, however, for the importance of community level initiative. He maintains that the vote with your fork movement obscures the structural foundation of the corporate food system. The alternative food movements, as a whole, fail to recognize that the inequities in the food system are connected to histories of racial and economic discrimination.<br />
Broad&#8217;s book More <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520287457">Than Just Food: Food Justice and Community Change</a> (University of California Press, 2016) examines the work of community-based food justice groups operating in South Los Angeles, like Community Services Unlimited (CSU). Founded as an arm of the South California Black Panther Party, CSU organizes at a grassroots level to provide community access to food, while using food as a means to foster consciousness and promote a broader movement for social justice. More Than Just Food narrates the stories of these organizations, evaluates the pitfalls and possibilities of community-level initiative, and highlights the problematic position of local groups working with national non-profit organizations, and governmental and corporate agencies. Through his engaged scholarship and nuanced analysis, Broad offers us a study of specific movements in their local context and makes recommendations to help future movements organize and act effectively.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

They provide the starting point for <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/sociology/staff/lynnepettinger/" target="_blank">Lynne Pettinger</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137342773/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Work, Consumption and Capitalism</a> (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015). Pettinger, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Warwick, examines the interrelationships between work and consumption, bringing a global perspective to these intertwined areas of social life. The book introduces core theories of capitalism, work, bodies, emotions and markets, with key examples including the fashion industry and other &#8216;aesthetic&#8217; economies. The book has a profound concern with the ethics of work and consumption, challenging ideas of what a good job or good work may be. Well written, with accessible examples and easy to follow discussions of complex ideas, Work, Consumption and Capitalism will be of interest to a range of social science scholars and students.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1784780839/?tag=newbooinhis-20">No Such Thing as a Free Gift: The Gates Foundation and the Price of Philanthropy</a> (Verso Books, 2015), <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/sociology/staff/profile.aspx?ID=1954">Linsey McGoey</a> proposes a new way of discussing philanthropy and, in doing so, revives associated historical debates often overlooked at present: from the ethics of clinical trials to industrial labor organizing in the early 20th century to global financial regulation.<br />
Tracing theological and industrial origins, among others, of what is now the field of philanthropy, Dr. McGoey asks how these institutions fit into the larger global economy. More broadly, McGoey suggests that capitalism has become the bedrock of many philanthropic social change efforts, reflected in the terms philanthrocapitalism, impact investment, and social enterprise among others. What, then, are the most appropriate questions to ask about regulation, morality, well-being, accountability, and profitability? No Such Thing As A Free Gift starts by examining the industry in the language of monopolies, investments, regulation, taxes, and democratic participation.<br />
Political philosophy and economic justice bookend several of the book&#8217;s core arguments, aiming to revisit earlier debates on the relationship between private wealth and the public good, often insisting that these questions are not only relevant to the current philanthropic landscape, but dictate it. While the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the unapologetic focus of the book, its chapters frame an important set of questions about the role of transnational, largely undemocratic institutions, in local and global policy-making.<br />

Humphrey School and the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. King is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor of American Government at the University of Oxford and Professorial Fellow, Nuffield College, Oxford.<br />
Lawrence Jacobs and Desmond King&#8217;s Fed Power follows the Federal Reserve Banks historic development from the 19th century to its current position as the most important institution in the American economy, possessing considerable autonomy to intervene in private markets. Despite its power and considerable resources, Jacobs and King claim that the Fed was asleep at the wheel when the recent economic crisis hit. The Fed acted swiftly to contain the crisis, but in the process exposed its strong favoritism. The authors dissect how the Fed&#8217;s programs during the Great Recession funneled enormous sums to a select few in the finance industry while leaving Main Street businesses adrift and millions of homeowners underwater.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Labour consciousness is not just class-based; it also emerges out of cultural identities, as <a href="https://csumb.edu/directory/people/angie-tran" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tran Ngoc Angie</a> argues powerfully in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0877277621/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ties that Bind: Cultural Identity, Class, and Law in Vietnam&#8217;s Labor Resistance</a> (Cornell University Press, 2013). Vietnamese workers habitually form relationships based on native place, ethnicity, religion and gender. At critical class moments, as Tran calls them, these workers can also succeed in transcending or building on their cultural ties to form larger movements for labour rights. Through detailed study of 33 cases from French colonial Indochina to present day Vietnam, Tran tracks labour activism across a range of political and economic conditions, industries and sectors. Concentrating on the period since economic reform and liberalization from 1986 to the present, she compares worker agency in state-owned and equitized factories, factories with foreign-direct investment and domestic privately owned factories, to arrive at findings that speak to conditions not only in Vietnam today, but also to the lives and struggles of workers across much of Southeast and East Asia. Angie Tran joins New Books in Southeast Asian Studies to talk about trends in labour unrest in Vietnam, the importance of legal claims to workers rights, cicada factories, and time taken to read graffiti on toilet walls.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://as.vanderbilt.edu/history/bio/jefferson-cowie" target="_blank">Jefferson Cowie</a> is the James G. Stahlman professor of history at Vanderbilt University. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691143803/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Great Exception: The New Deal and the Limits of American Politics</a> (Princeton University Press, 2016) interprets the New Deal as a massive but unstable experiment from the main of American political culture. Against arguments that the New Deal was the product of the American penchant for reform, Cowie asserts that it was a remarkable historical detour. The Great Depression and WWII were specific historical circumstances that wrought a short-lived effort for central government intervention in securing collective economic rights. Unions flourished, industrial workers gained job security and good wages, and the country enjoyed a relative amount of political cohesion. Multiple legislative measures and the growth of unions offered a countervailing power against corporate wealth accumulation and promised a bright economic future. Several enduring fissures in political culture would all but undo the New Deal after the 1970s. The long tensions over immigration, religious and racial hostility, the frailty of unions, and the ideology of Jeffersonian individualism remained and assured that the new interventionist role for the state would not last. By examining the birth of New Deal and its decline, Cowie locates a legacy of individual rights that stood against its long-term viability. As the central government has continued to expand under free market ideology, collective initiatives are being led at the local and state level by a cross-class neo-progressivism organizing labor and advocating for immigrants and other minorities. While the New Deal gave way to free market ideology, the future may lie in a new imaginary rising from below.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://equitablegrowth.org/person/heather-boushey/" target="_blank">Heather Boushey</a> has written <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674660161/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Finding Time: The Economies of Work-Life Conflict</a> (Harvard University Press, 2016). Boushey is Executive Director and Chief Economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth.<br />
How should policy-makers respond to the fact that women now make at least a quarter of the earnings in more than two-thirds of families with children and, in many households, women bring in more than half of the earned income? In Finding Time, Boushey offers a round-map for policy-makers to adjust social policy for these positive changes in the economy and U.S. workforce. Paid sick days, paid family and medical leave, scheduling predictability, limiting overwork, and elder care are all options on the agenda that many states and localities have implemented. Boushey argues for a more comprehensive approach to social policy that draws on what has been learned about effective policy making and the reality of the 21st century economy.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The social sciences are about social entities &#8211; things like corporations and traffic jams, mobs and money, parents and war criminals. What is a social entity? What makes something a social entity? Traditional views hold that these things can be fully explained by facts about people &#8211; their bodies, their attitudes or some combination of these. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199381100/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Ant Trap: Rebuilding the Foundations of the Social Sciences</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015), <a href="https://epstein.org/" target="_blank">Brian Epstein</a> argues that such views of social facts are untenably anthropocentric: social facts supervene on much more than just people. His model distinguishes two kinds of questions that a theory of social ontology must answer. When are social categories realized, or what grounds a social fact (such as the fact that someone is a war criminal)? And what explains how these categories get established, or what anchors the category? Epstein, an assistant professor of philosophy at Tufts University, also uses his model to provide a new analysis of group action and group intention. On his view, group action is not exhausted by the actions of members, and group intention depends on more than member attitudes.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id(130d41b8-592a-41c4-ac22-940e6ff2a648).html" target="_blank">Christian Olaf Christiansen</a> is an associate professor in the history of ideas at Aarhus University, Denmark. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198701039/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Progressive Business: An Intellectual History of the Role of Business in American Society</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015) offers a compelling history of the idea of a gentler capitalism, or of the &#8220;soulful&#8221; self-regulating corporation, that can flourish economically while doing social good. The idea of &#8220;market reformism&#8221; against a pure laissez-faire has been an important concept in three distinct periods of U.S. history. In the late nineteenth century, the nation experienced the first economic transformation toward large-scale industrial capitalism engendering &#8220;paternalistic market reformism&#8221; to alleviate the harshest elements of laissez-faire. The second period of change was the decades of the New Deal in which &#8220;political reformism&#8221; took hold. Advocates for self-regulation promoted a &#8220;managerial market reformism&#8221; in which professional managers were to play a key role in negotiating the needs of the corporation and multiple stakeholders. The third period is the most recent era of globalization in which neo-liberal ascendancy was met by a complimentary &#8220;entrepreneurial market reformism&#8221; in which capitalism is promoted as democratic, cool, revolutionary and egalitarian. All forms of self-regulation, as a third way that rejects both pure capitalism and state intervention, have been met with criticism. Some have held to the idea that the business of business is to maximize shareholder profits, not social engineering. Others advocating for political reform were skeptical of business acting against its own best interest and called for the countervailing power of government. Christiansen has provided a valuable roadmap for understanding the claims of corporate social responsibility in a neoliberal age.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Chances are that at this very moment, you are either looking at a computer screen, holding a digital device, or listening to my voice through plastic earphones. Our computers and these other devices are constructed out of materials that have their origins in lands across the globe. And oil plays a central and early role in the causal story of how we came into possession of them. Oil also plays a leading role in the major global conflicts of our day. Much of the world&#8217;s oil is sold to us by brutal tyrants who use the monetary proceeds to strengthen their tyranny. But it is arguable that tyrants who control a territory have no legitimate claim to ownership of the territory&#8217;s resources; the oil belongs to the people, not to the tyrant. So the oil that goes into creating the objects that we now possess and use is likely stolen. How is it then that your computer, which is made of oil in the form of plastic, is your property? And what can be done about the fact that out ordinary consumption habits so directly place large sums of money into the pockets of the world&#8217;s most brutal men?<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190262923/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Blood Oil: Tyranny, Violence, and the Rules that Run the World</a> (Oxford University Press, 2016), <a href="http://www.wenar.info/#first">Leif Wenar</a> examines the history, sociology, and politics of the global oil trade. Although the reality depicted in the book is bleak and disturbing, Wenar&#8217;s message is ultimately uplifting. He argues that, despite all of the prevailing injustices in the world, the tools of radical reform are close at hand.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Levine teaches in the Department of Government at Cornell University.<br />
If we have learned anything about American politics over the last several months, it is that there are a lot of people who are angry about the present and fearful about the future. American Insecurity demonstrates why it is difficult to channel these sentiments into political action. Using a series of lab and field experiments, we learn in American Insecurity that those who feel economically insecure may be de-mobilized if reminded about their insecurity. There are numerous implications of Levine&#8217;s findings for how we understand the psychology of insecurity and the ways interest groups might hone mobilization strategies.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The Canadian author and journalist <a href="http://www.naomiklein.org/main">Naomi Klein</a> says right-wing conservatives who deny the reality of global warming are correct about the revolutionary implications of climate change.<br />
In her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1451697392/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate </a>(Simon and Schuster, 2014) Klein quotes Thomas J. Donohue, President of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who says that the steps being proposed to radically reduce carbon emissions would change the American way of life and put large segments of the economy out of business.<br />
Klein agrees, but argues that transforming global capitalism into a more humane economic system would be a good thing. In her book, she urges progressives who care about the environment to show that the steps needed to avert catastrophic climate change &#8220;are also our best hope of building a much more stable and equitable economic system, one that strengthens and transforms the public sphere, generates plentiful, dignified work, and radically reins in corporate greed.&#8221;<br />
Klein also argues that the imperatives of growth and consumption that drive global capitalism are incompatible with what we need to do to avert catastrophic warming.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.colby.edu/directory/profile/prjoseph/">Paul R. Josephson</a>&#8216;s new book explores everyday technologies &#8211; fish sticks, sports bras, sugar, bananas, aluminum cans, potatoes, fructose, and more &#8211; as technological systems that embody vast social, political, cultural histories within relatively small packages. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421417839/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Fish Sticks, Sports Bras, and Aluminum Cans: The Politics of Everyday Technologies</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2015) traces some major themes through a series of fascinating and engagingly written case studies. As readers explore the chapters, we learn that fish sticks (the &#8220;ocean&#8217;s hot dog&#8221;) were created less as a result of consumer demand, and more as a result of over-production thanks to new technologies related to fishing, refrigeration, materials science, the postwar kitchen, and more. We learn about the invention of the sports bra as a story of &#8220;reverse gender engineering&#8221; that involved the transformation of jock straps. We learn of the colonial and postcolonial histories &#8211; of slavery, exploitation, technological innovation &#8211; staring back at us every time we look at a banana or an aluminum can. We learn to see French fries and high fructose corn syrup as &#8220;self-augmenting technologies.&#8221; We learn that there&#8217;s nothing strictly &#8220;natural&#8221; about natural disasters. And we are offered a glimpse into the use of large-scale technologies as symbols of state power in Russia. The book concludes with two more stories &#8211; of books and bicycles &#8211; that leave us with important lessons to take away from the book after we put it down. Enjoy!<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190216409/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Rigging The Game: How Inequality is Reproduced in Everyday Life</a> (Oxford University Press, 2014), <a href="http://socant.chass.ncsu.edu/faculty_staff/duckpond">Michael Schwalbe</a> identifies the roots of inequality in the appearance of economic surplus as human societies transitioned from communal hunting and gathering societies to forms of sedentary agricultural production that enabled a few to live off the surplus produced by the many. This immanently historical and human development of a class-stratified society was subsequently reified by the exploiting few, and made to appear to others as being the result of divine or natural forces that could not be altered. Schwalbe then reveals the present-day forms of reification used by the wealthy (the American 1%) to justify their privilege to keep poor and working class from imagining a better world and the way to reach it. The book is rich with pedagogical insight and suggestions for classroom use.<br />
In this interview Schwalbe responded to questions about his educational philosophy and views on the 2016 presidential campaign.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107099358/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Waste into Weapons: Recycling in Britain during the Second World War</a> (Cambridge University Press 2015), <a href="http://history.uncc.edu/dr-peter-thorsheim" target="_blank">Peter Thorsheim</a> explores the role of waste and recycling in Britain under conditions of total war. Thorsheim argues wartime salvage efforts linked civilians socially as well as materially to the war. Salvage drives served to focus people&#8217;s efforts and helped them make sense of the events around them and their role in the conflict. The ebb and flow of resource scarcity served as a metric in which to measure changing military and strategic concerns against the Axis, but also complicated the wartime alliance between the British Empire and the United States.<br />
Although essential for national survival, Thorsheim shows how wartime salvage tended to alienate as much as unite the British public. Vigorous, but often ill-conceived, salvage efforts led to infringements of civil liberties, destroyed historical artifacts, and damaged private property. Some materials were never recycled and left to languish in enormous dumps long after the end of the war. The national salvage effort angered thousands and left many without compensation for their losses, souring a generation on recycling.<br />
Unlike the environmental movement of the 1970s, Waste into Weapons shows recycling was a means to further destruction rather than conservation. Thorsheim&#8217;s book sheds light on a little known episode in environmental history and provides alternative genealogy of recycling in the twentieth century.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Specifically, the project brings together two large-scale debates that emerge from very different rice historiographies: the &#8220;Black Rice&#8221; and &#8220;agricultural involution&#8221; debates frame the inquiry here, and as you listen to my conversation with Francesca and Dagmar (the two co-editors with whom I spoke for the podcast) you&#8217;ll hear them offer an overview of the nature and stakes of both of those areas of inquiry. In the course of the conversation we also had a chance to talk about the collaborative process that produced the volume, a process that successfully maintained the specificity of the local case studies while still enabling authors to contribute to and participate in a common, global conversation that made new kinds of comparisons possible.

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1781689024/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Capitalism in the Web of Life: Ecology and the Accumulation of Capital</a> (Verso, 2015), author <a href="http://www.jasonwmoore.com/">Jason W. Moore</a> seeks to undermine popular understandings of the relationship among society, environment, and capitalism. Rather, than seeing society and environment as acting on an external, nonhuman nature, Moore wants us to recognize capitalism-in-nature. For Moore, seeing society and environment as separate has hampered clear thinking on the problems we face, such as climate change or the end of cheap nature, as well as political solutions to these issues. His book is an analysis of the interrelationship of capitalism and nature over the past few centuries as well as a critique of important environmental concepts such as the Anthropocene.<br />
Moore is assistant professor of sociology at SUNY-Binghamton and coordinator of the World Ecology Research Network. This book is a product of over a decade of research and writings on world ecology and evidence of his wide-ranging scholarship.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0190204141/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Yankel&#8217;s Tavern: Jews, Liquor, and Life in the Kingdom of Poland</a> (Oxford UP, 2014), <a href="https://www.sarahlawrence.edu/faculty/dynner-glenn.html" target="_blank">Glenn Dynner</a>, Professor of Religion at Sarah Lawrence College, explores the world of Jewish-run taverns in nineteenth-century Eastern Europe. Jews had to fend off reformers and government officials that sought to drive Jews out of the liquor trade.<br />
Dynner argues that many nobles helped their Jewish tavernkeepers evade fees, bans, and expulsions by installing Christians as fronts for their taverns, revealing a surprising level of Polish-Jewish co-existence that changes the way we think about life in the Kingdom of Poland.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Though the conventional history of the U.S.-led &#8220;War on Drugs&#8221; locates the origins of this conflict in a reaction to the domestic culture of excess of the 1960s, a new book argues that international drug control efforts are actually decades older, and much more imbricated with the history of U.S. access to international markets, than we have previously thought. <a href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/history/people/suzanna-reiss">Suzanna Reiss&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520280784/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">We Sell Drugs: The Alchemy of US Empire</a> (University of California Press, 2014) uncovers this history by tracing the transnational geography and political economy of coca commodities&#8211;stretching from Peru and Bolivia into the United States, and back again. The book examines how economic controls put in place during WWII transformed the power of the U.S. pharmaceutical industry in Latin America and beyond, and gave rise to new definitions of legality and illegality&#8211;definitions that were largely premised on who grew, manufactured, distributed, and consumed drugs, and not on the qualities of the drugs themselves. Drug control, she shows, is a powerful tool for ordering international trade, national economies, and society&#8217;s habits and daily lives.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In answering that question, Empires of Coal looks carefully at the importance of mining (including state management and legal regulation thereof) to the political economy of late imperial China. As geology developed into an independent discipline separate from geography, it help colonizers cement their power by aiding efforts to extract valuable mineral deposits from the colonies. Wu traces the archive produced in this context as coal became crucial not just to foreign interest in China, but also to China&#8217;s interest in mineral resources, exploring a wide range of maps, translations, letters, essays, journals, textbooks, and other materials. The book also situates this story within a history of mineral sciences, scientists, and engineers in China. It will be required reading for anyone interested in the entanglement of science, technology, and modernity in global history.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10212/Desan" target="_blank">Christine Desan</a>, teaches about the international monetary system, the constitutional law of money, constitutional history, political economy, and legal theory at Harvard Law School. In this podcast we discuss her new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0198709587/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Making Money: Coin, Currency, and the Coming of Capitalism</a> (Oxford University Press, 2015).<br />
Per the books jacket, &#8220;Money travels the modern world in disguise. It looks like a convention of human exchange &#8211; a commodity like gold or a medium like language. But its history reveals that money is a very different matter. It is an institution engineered by political communities to mark and mobilize resources. As societies change the way they create money, they change the market itself &#8211; along with the rules that structure it, the politics and ideas that shape it, and the benefits that flow from it. One particularly dramatic transformation in money&#8217;s design brought capitalism to England. For centuries, the English government monopolized money&#8217;s creation. The Crown sold people coin for a fee in exchange for silver and gold. &#8220;Commodity money&#8221; was a fragile and difficult medium; the first half of the book considers the kinds of exchange and credit it invited, as well as the politics it engendered. Capitalism arrived when the English reinvented money at the end of the 17th century. When it established the Bank of England, the government shared its monopoly over money creation for the first time with private investors, institutionalizing their self-interest as the pump that would produce the money supply. The second half of the book considers the monetary revolution that brought unprecedented possibilities and problems. The invention of circulating public debt, the breakdown of commodity money, the rise of commercial bank currency, and the coalescence of ideological commitments that came to be identified with the Gold Standard &#8211; all contributed to the abundant and unstable medium that is modern money. All flowed as well from a collision between the individual incentives and public claims at the heart of the system. The drama had constitutional dimension: money, as its history reveals, is a mode of governance in a material world. That character undermines claims in economics about money&#8217;s neutrality. The monetary design innovated in England would later spread, producing the global architecture of modern money.&#8221;<br />
Some of the topics we cover are:<br />
<br />
* How the work&#8217;s assertion that money is a mode of governance in a material world undermines claims in economics about money&#8217;s neutrality.<br />
<br />
<br />
* The &#8220;free minting&#8221; system and why legal enforcement was essential to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
* The radical redesign of money that began in the 17th century.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Video games have become an important cultural and economic force in our media environment. In his new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1844573176/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank"> The Video Game Business</a> (British Film Institute, 2014), scholar <a href="http://randalljnichols.com/" target="_blank">Randy Nichols</a> provides an overview of the increasingly diverse global market for video games. Nichols locates the origins of the video game industry back to the dawn of the computer age in the 1960s. He then explores the emergence of an industry around video games, noting the interdependence of hardware and software across a number of key &#8220;epochs&#8221;: from consoles to computer gaming to the explosion of mobile gaming. Throughout the book, Nichols explores key moments of transition in video games by providing institutional profiles of key industrial players in the industry. His critical analysis of power in the video game industry also explores the role of labor and audiences.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Credit, debt and default are embedded into everyday life, whether as a constant part of people&#8217;s daily routines or as a constantly discussed topic in news media. <a href="http://lancaster.academia.edu/JoeDeville">Joe Deville</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415622509">Lived Economies of Default: Consumer Credit, Debt Collection and the Capture of Affect</a>, helps to make sense of this by asking how this core part of the social world functions.The book draws on science and technology studies and theories of affect, to lay bare the practices of attaching the debtor to debt, and to getting debts to be repaid. The book has case studies of credit cards, collections agencies, telephone calls and letters, revealing the reality of default and debt in contemporary society. The book will appeal widely, not only to sociology, organization studies and anthropology, but also to politics, psychology, and the wider humanities.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What meaning does money have in psychic life? And where does clinical psychoanalytic work fall in the realm of commerce? Does money play an inherently alienating role with regards to the psychoanalytic subject? Or might it contain meaning crucial to the patient&#8217;s progress? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/041589171X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Money Talks in Therapy, Society, and Life</a> (Routledge, 2011), <a href="http://www.psychoanalysis.columbia.edu/people/faculty/brenda-berger-phd" target="_blank">Brenda Berger</a> and <a href="http://www.newmantherapymanhattan.com/" target="_blank">Stephanie Newman</a> present a collection covering a wide range on the topic from varied psychoanalytic perspectives. With contributions from Muriel Dimen, Robert Glick, Theodore Jacobs, and others, money is understood in terms of psychosexuality, greed, envy, narcissism, sexuality, loss, the economics among candidates in psychoanalytic training institutes, and its ever-present roll in the transference/countertransference matrix.<br />
In the interview Berger describes the ways in which money was split off and denied in clinical psychoanalysis in the years leading up to the economic crash of 2008, and how this was followed by a re-emergence within the field after 2008. Berger offers compelling clinical examples to illuminate the ways in which landscape shifted dramatically after the crash, as money became, more and more, a container for psychic meaning. We discuss the ways in which the loss of money often facilitated deepening shifts within the treatment, as well as the psychic implications of financial fallout and what the current economic realities might mean for psychoanalysis in general.<br />
Brenda Berger is Assistant Clinical Professor of Medical Psychology in Psychiatry and Senior Associate Director for Psychology at the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. Dr. Berger is in private practice in New York City and Larchmont, NY, working with couples, individuals, and groups.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1138839310/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Culture and Economy in the Age of Social Media</a> (Routledge, 2015), <a href="http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/christian-fuchs">Christian Fuchs</a>, a professor of social media at the University of Westminster, brings together a range of media, social and economic theorists to explain social media. Using Raymond Williams to draw attention to the material conditions of control, production and use of social media, including case studies from the USA and China. Most notably the book insists on understanding the international division of labour behind the seemingly ephemeral aspects of online interactions.

Wallach is a fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.<br />
There has been a lot written about the financial crisis of the late 2000s, but little with the attention to important concepts from political science. Wallach investigates the various federal strategies to address the meltdown of the financial sector from the perspective of legitimacy, seeking to understand what we can learn about this idea from the unprecedented expansion of federal power. From efforts to save the failing investment banks, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, to the passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), federal officials applied a largely ad-hoc approach that Wallach deems &#8220;adhocracy&#8221; often substituting expedience for legal authority. While this worked in the short-term, Wallach probes where this leaves the country and speculates about what will come in the future.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[There&#8217;s a lot more to money than its exchange value, as <a href="http://tulane.edu/liberal-arts/anthropology/faculty/allison-truitt.cfm">Allison Truitt</a> reveals in her smartly written and lively study, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allison-Truitt/e/B00BCP9YR2">Dreaming of Money in Ho Chi Minh City </a>(University of Washington Press, 2013)about how people in Vietnam&#8217;s largest city negotiate relations with one another, the state, the global marketplace and the spirit world through dollars and dong,<br />
On the streets of Ho Chi Minh City, remitted greenbacks cease to be the stuff of the currency trader or foreign state. Here, they take on new and distinctive roles. They mingle with their counterfeits, the one burned at cemeteries and shrines to satisfy ancestral debts, the other sent by relatives living abroad to acknowledge the debt-bond owed by those who have left the country to those who remain behind. They celebrate the transnational yet also beckon to the intimate. And, they challenge the communist party to reorder its narrative of modernity so as to maintain the primacy of its role in political and administrative affairs.<br />
As Truitt herself puts it, Dreaming of Money in Ho Chi Minh City tells a story of &#8220;monetary pluralism rather than tightly wound institutional bets, of the sensuous pleasures of cash rather than calculations of derivatives&#8221;. It also tells a story of power: of the claims to power that states make through the production of territorial currency, and of how those claims are undermined by the ways that people use money for their own purposes.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1012724" target="_blank">Brett Sheehan</a>&#8216;s new book traces the interwoven histories of capitalism and the Song family under a series of five authoritarian governments in North China. Based on a wide range of sources a range of sources including family papers, missionary archives, corporate records, government documents, newspapers, oral histories, novels, and interviews, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674967607/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Industrial Eden: A Chinese Capitalist Vision</a> (Harvard UP, 2015) explores a family of &#8220;capitalists without capitalism.&#8221; The book follows the development of Song Chuandian and his son Song Feiqing into businessmen in order to inform and transform how we understand the modern history of the Chinese economy in its social and political context. The evidence of the Song family, Sheehan compellingly argues, allows us to understand the impact of European and Japanese imperialism on the Chinese economy and Chinese business practices in a new way. At the same time, there is no single, culturally-determined set of &#8220;Chinese business practices&#8221;: in the example of Song Feiqing, we see a hybrid of Confucian paternalism, Christianity, industrialism, hygiene, discipline, and more. Though the authoritarian governments that ruled China in the twentieth century varied widely, Industrial Eden shows that Chinese states and businesspeople came both to accept a government role in business that became increasingly intrusive, and to expect increasingly more from the state over time. The book also pays careful attention to the ways that this story informs the history of missionary activity, commodities, nationalism, labor, diaspora, and disciplining of the modern subject in nineteenth and twentieth century China.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The functioning of the global economy remains as relevant a topic as ever before. Commentators continue to debate the causes and consequences of the financial crisis that hit the United States from 2007-2008. They also continue to ask questions such as: How long will China keep purchasing the treasury bonds that the U.S. government needs to help finance its ever-increasing debt? Just how long can the dollar remain the global reserve currency before being replaced by another national currency or some sort of international monetary unit? Will the global flows of capital facilitated by &#8220;free-floating&#8221; exchange rates eventually undermine the healthy functioning of international economy and usher in another global depression?<br />
In his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/160598681X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Summit: Bretton Woods, 1944</a> (Pegasus Books, 2014), journalist <a href="http://www.edmundconway.com/" target="_blank">Ed Conway</a> uses the story of the Bretton Woods Summit to help readers better understand the difficulties involved in creating a stable and prosperous global monetary system. In easy-to-follow and engaging prose, he recounts the rise and fall of the gold standard. Drawing on many previously unused sources, he also explains how actors as different as the British economist John Maynard Keynes and U.S. treasury official Harry Dexter White worked to create a more flexible, cooperative global monetary system that would prevent future World Wars and Great Depressions. Conway&#8217;s section on the Summit tells the fascinating stories of how the participants ended up creating the Bretton Woods framework by linking the dollar to gold and creating the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.<br />
Unlike many accounts of the Bretton Woods Summit that paint the gathering as a dull economic conference, Conway&#8217;s book succeeds in portraying the human drama of the event and the complex ways that personalities influenced the final agreements. In ways that will appeal to the general reader and expert alike, he embeds his cogent economic analysis within stories as diverse as the drinking songs that attendees belted out at the Mount Washington Hotel bar and the volleyball match that took place between U.S. and Soviet officials. A magician and dance instructor also make appearances in the story.<br />
Like any good book should, Conway gives readers much food for thought. While the Bretton Woods framework had many faults, it largely coincided with the longest economic expansion in human history. Even if this framework&#8217;s inherent limitations make it an impractical option today, policymakers would be wise to reflect on how their predecessors worked to promote global economic stability. As history shows, they could do worse than the motley collection of individuals who came to Bretton Woods in 1944.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[According to a popular saying, &#8220;Nothing succeeds like success.&#8221; As concernswhat economists and political scientists call &#8220;development&#8221;&#8211;that is, progress towards libertyand prosperity&#8211;the saying seems to be true. As a general rule, the countries that were relatively free and relatively prosperous 100 years ago are the ones that are relatively free and relatively prosperous today.200 years ago? Yes, more or less. 300 years ago? Well, probably. 400 years ago? A good argument could be made&#8230;<br />
Why? According to one argument, the difference is caused by the rich praying on the poor. In a word, imperialism. But if you survey countries around the world, it&#8217;s not clear whether imperialism (and colonization) hurt or helped development. The Spanish thoroughly imperialized Mexico, and it&#8217;s pretty prosperous; no one really got into the interior of Africa and it&#8217;s not.  And what are we to make of developmental differences within, say, prosperous Europe? No real imperialism there; a lot of bloody war, but no imperialism as such. Germany is free and prosperous. Russia is not free and not prosperous. Why is that?<br />
In their impressive and refreshing book<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O0RKCF2/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Long Process of Development: Building Markets and States in Pre-industrial England, Spain and their Colonies</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2014),<a href="http://polisci.duke.edu/people?Gurl=&amp;Uil=1582&amp;subpage=profile" target="_blank">Jerry F. Hough</a> and <a href="http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/G/Robin.M.Grier-1/home.html" target="_blank">Robin Grier </a>argue that it&#8217;s not so much imperialism that impedes development, but style of governance and, especially, time. If autocratic governments do nothing buttake rents, thesocieties they rule will not develop, not ever, no matter how long or hard the governmentstry to development them. If they are even semi-popular and pro-trade, they will develop, though it will take a very, very long time. There&#8217;s no magic built. You can&#8217;t simply import democracy and capitalism and hope for a rapid transitionto freedom and prosperity.The process of development takes centuries.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Putnam" target="_blank">Robert Putnam</a> is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1476769893/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis</a> (Simon and Schuster, 2015). Putnam is the Peter and Isabel Malkin Professor of Public Policy at Harvard University. He has written fourteen books including the best-seller, Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.<br />
Few political scientists command attention like Robert Putnam. For that reason, scholars and the wider public are eager for his take on our current state of affairs. His latest book, Our Kids, paints a grim picture of US life in the twentieth century. The social mobility that Putnam associates with his childhood growing up in Ohio is largely gone, replaced by deep income inequality and increasingly rigid class boundaries. Putnam demonstrates this with a combination of individual stories and supporting social science evidence all that point to education (or inadequate education) as the key determining factor. But in the end Putnam is not a pessimist, instead he sees opportunities for social change. The book ends with a series of recommendations, most non-political, but all aimed to address the country&#8217;s mobility problem.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Two Canadian socialist thinkers have published a new book on the successes and failures, the crises, contradictions and conflicts in present-day capitalism. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1781681368/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Making of Global Capitalism: The Political Economy of American Empire </a>(Verso, 2013), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Panitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Panitch</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Gindin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Gindin</a> trace the evolution of the international capitalist system over the last century. (Panitch is a professor of political science at Toronto&#8217;s York University while Gindin holds the Packer Chair in Social Justice at York.)<br />
They argue that today&#8217;s global capitalism would not have been possible without American leadership especially after the two World Wars and that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve were more crucial in extending and maintaining American power than the Pentagon or the CIA.<br />
The U.S. capitalist empire is an &#8220;informal&#8221; one, they write, in which Americans set the terms for international trade and investment in partnership with other sovereign, but less powerful states. Panitch and Gindin also disagree with those who contend that China is set to replace the U.S. as the world&#8217;s economic superpower. They write that China does not have the institutional capacity to manage the crisis-prone, global capitalist system &#8212; a burden that, for the foreseeable future, will continue to be carried by the American empire.<br />
The Making of Global Capitalism: The Political Economy of American Empire won the 2013 Deutscher Prize awarded for books which exemplify &#8220;the best and most innovative new writing in or about the Marxist tradition.&#8221;<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="https://hal.arts.unsw.edu.au/about-us/people/nicolas-rasmussen/" target="_blank">Nicolas Rasmussen</a>&#8216;s new book maps the intersection of biotechnology and the business world in the last decades of the twentieth century. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/142141340X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Gene Jockeys: Life Science and the Rise of Biotech Enterprise </a>(Johns Hopkins University Press, 2014) takes readers into the fascinating world of entrepreneur-biologists as they developed five of the first products of genetic engineering. Based on a documentary archive that includes oral history interviews and corporate documents resulting from patent litigation, Rasmussen&#8217;s book emphasizes the agency of the biologists in in driving the development of first-generation recombinant DNA drugs like insulin, human growth hormone, and interferon. After an introduction to the development of basic molecular biology in a Cold War context &#8211; and paying special attention to the ways that Kuhn&#8217;s notion of &#8220;normal science&#8221; helped shape the discipline &#8211; the ensuing chapters each present a case study that illustrates an important aspect of the history of biotech&#8217;s rise as manifest in laboratories, courtrooms, universities, freezers, markets, and the public arena. Gene Jockeys closes with a chapter that considers the policy lessons that can be taken from this story.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://history.jhu.edu/directory/michael-kwass/">Michael Kwass</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674726833">Contraband: Louis Mandrin and the Making of a Global Underground</a> is much more than an exciting biography of the notorious eighteenth-century smuggler whose name remains legendary in contemporary France. Focusing on the rise and fall of a mythic, early-modern French bandit, Kwass&#8217;s study moves between the micro- and the macro-historical, revealing the crucial role that smuggling played in a French economic and political landscape that must be understood in global perspective. The book shows how the underground economy that emerged during the ancien regime developed in close relationship to the trade practices and regulation attempts of the French state. The opposite was also true. State efforts to regulate trade in tobacco and calico from the reign of Louis XIV onwards contributed to the development of illicit activity and networks, and the desire to quash the economic underground, in turn, provoked changes in economic policy, legislation, and perceptions of the need for reform in the years leading up to the French Revolution.<br />
Revisiting the history of the &#8220;consumer revolution&#8221; of the eighteenth century, Contraband draws our attention to the violence and struggle that accompanied the proliferation of goods and markets associated with &#8220;modernity.&#8221; In our interview, Michael underlines his aim to write a history inspired by, and in conversation with, more recent events and debates about &#8220;the dark side of globalization&#8221;. This makes the book a must-read for anyone interested in the longer-term history of the forms of contraband, regulation, and resistance that shape the economic, political, and cultural networks (both legal and illicit) of the present on a global scale.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

As with all interdisciplinary subjects, business anthropology has been infiltrated by other social scientists, designers and marketers. Denny and Sunderland made sure to also include those perspectives among the 60 plus authors that are featured in the handbook. This is a great reference for any anthropologist in practice, and an interesting read about the ways in which anthropology is adapting and changing. Questions about how to present anthropological findings and conduct fieldwork in a business setting are analyzed through the lenses of the academic discipline and the industry, If you have any interest in practicing anthropology, conducting ethnography, or anthropological research methods in business, this is a must have reference for your shelf.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Dalits and Adivasis in India&#8217;s Business Economy: Three Essays and an Atlas (Three Essay Collective, 2013) is a wonderful new book by <a href="http://www.orinst.ox.ac.uk/staff/isa/bharrisswhite.html" target="_blank">Barbara Harriss-White</a> and small team of collaborators &#8211; Elisabetta Basile, Anita Dixit, Pinaki Joddar, Aseem Prakash and Kaushal Vidyarthee &#8211; published by the Three Essays Collective.<br />
The book explores the ways in which economic liberalisation interacts with caste, specifically in reference to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, otherwise known as Dalits and Adivasis. A truly unique book, both in terms of how the data has been gathered and presented, the essays are variously wide and deep and ask a host of questions to inspire future research.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[How did we come to think of spaces for the storage and circulation of body parts as &#8220;banks,&#8221; and what are the consequences of that history for the way we think about human bodies as property today? <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/law/faculty/directory/swanson.html" target="_blank">Kara W. Swanson</a>&#8216;s wonderful new book traces the history of body banks in America from the nineteenth century to today, focusing especially on milk, blood, and sperm. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674281438/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Banking on the Body: The Market in Blood, Milk, and Sperm in Modern America </a>(Harvard University Press, 2014) takes readers into early twentieth-century America, when doctors first turned to human bodies and their parts as sources of material to help cure their most desperate cases. As these doctors developed an expertise in harvesting body products and sought reliable and cooperative supplies thereof, human milk and blood were first transformed into commodities. Swanson&#8217;s story introduces some of the most crucial actors in this history, including wet nurses, professional blood donors, Red Cross volunteer &#8220;Grey Ladies,&#8221; doctors, blood bank managers, mothers who ran milk banks, sperm donors, and many, many others. The story is deeply satisfying on many levels: as a window into particular human lives, as a conceptual history with material consequences, and as a set of case studies that illuminates and informs today&#8217;s legal and medical landscapes. This is a book that should be on the shelves and in the hands of anyone interested in legal history, medical history, modern notions of &#8220;property,&#8221; and the ways that the past had shaped what happens to our bodies in the present and what might happen to them in the future.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816677859/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Lifeblood: Oil, Freedom, and the Forces of Capital </a>(University of Minnesota Press, 2013) is an incisive look into how oil permeates our lives and helped shape American politics during the twentieth century. Author <a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/geo/Huber,_Matthew_T_/" target="_blank">Matthew Huber</a> shows the crucial role oil and housing policy played in the New Deal and how, in subsequent decades, government policies drove many Americans to the suburbs and increased their dependence on petroleum. Although such policies were central to suburbanization, Americans in these new neighborhoods tended to forget this fact, and instead, saw their success in the suburbs as the outcome of private achievements. Over time, such places became the crucible for the growth of neoliberalism. Lifeblood demonstrates the role oil played not only in suburbanization, but in the rightward shift of American politics over the past four decades.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[&#8220;Diamonds are forever&#8221; or &#8220;Blood diamonds&#8221;&#8211;the one a pithy marketing slogan showing how diamonds encapsulate enduring love and commitment and the other a call to conscience about the violence and suffering the quest for diamonds has entailed throughout Africa, the supplier of the majority of the world&#8217;s diamonds. In his engagingly written and concise history, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/082142100X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Stones of Contention: A History of Africa&#8217;s Diamonds</a> (Ohio University Press, 2014), <a href="http://www.augustana.edu/academics/faculty-directory/directory?pid=7GsCFjb" target="_blank">Todd Cleveland</a> looks at the scope and complexity of the African diamond industry and trade from the earliest expressions of international interest in the continent&#8217;s mineral wealth to the present day. He highlights the experiences of Africans and their involvement in the mining and processing of diamonds. From artisanal miners working alluvial deposits to company miner workers in South Africa to armed rebels in West Africa to successful industrial operations in Botswana and Namibia, Cleveland provides a panoramic and balanced perspective on both the history and the moral issues involved in assessing diamonds in Africa and their consumption globally. He examines efforts to regulate the diamond trade and offers reasons for optimism that out of these &#8220;stones of contention&#8221; programs for meaningful, equitable and effective economic and political development may emerge.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The new book,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1442646462/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Constructing Neoliberalism: Economic Transformation in Anglo-American Democracies</a>  (University of Toronto Press, 2013)  shows how political elites in Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada successfully introduced radically new economic policies in the 1980s. While opinion polls have consistently showed that neoliberal policies are not popular, governments in all four countries have continued implementing an agenda that includes government spending cuts, the privatization of state-owned enterprises and free trade. The book&#8217;s author, <a href="https://www.pnc.edu/ss/jonathan-swarts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Swarts</a>, Associate Professor of Political Science at Purdue University North Central in northwestern Indiana, says he finds it fascinating how governments of all political stripes in the four Anglo-American democracies have adopted neoliberalism, which he calls a new &#8220;political-economic imaginary.&#8221; In this interview with the New Books Network, Professor Swarts discusses how political leaders in the four Anglo-American democracies brought about the neoliberal economic transformation using a combination of persuasion and coercion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[An unflinching examination of the trauma, violence, opportunism, and vision that combined to create the empire for slavery that was the Old South, <a href="http://history.arts.cornell.edu/faculty-department-baptist.php" target="_blank">Ed Baptist</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/046500296X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism</a> (Basic Books, 2014) challenges popular conceptions of that region that imagine it as a land of proud men, genteel ladies, and an antiquated, inefficient system of labor. The slavery that Baptist uncovers is dynamic, relentless, brutal, and extremely profitable. Surviving it, he shows, was an impressive accomplishment all its own. And its role in driving the development of American capitalism in the formative years of the republic raises troubling questions about the legacy of slavery in contemporary times.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Zavattaro is assistant professor of public administration at Mississippi State University.<br />
Cities have received renewed interest from political scientists recently. Previously, Ravi K. Perry was on the podcast to discuss his book Black Mayors, White Majorities: The Balancing Act of Racial Politics (University of Nebraska Press, 2014). Zavattaro approaches the local subject from the perspective of public administration and an eye toward the marketing of cities. You&#8217;d be hard presses to live in a community that hasn&#8217;t launched a new publicity campaign or a new slogan to attract new residents.  Zavattaro tries to analyze these efforts and suggests that cities use six selling tactics to advance their interests: branding, media relations, in-house publications, use of volunteers and outside organizations as PR surrogates, aesthetic and affective appeal, and built environment via sustainability. Zavattaro acknowledges the limits of this metaphor and, in her conclusion, addresses the risks associated with a model of urban governance focused on marketing rather than other social values.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Since the 1990s, the music industry has been going through a massive transformation. After World War II, the primary way audiences participated in the music business in the period between 1945 and 1990 was by purchasing records and attending concerts. The internet and the mp3 file, however, have changed how people are listening to music.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415890632/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popular Music in a Digital Music Economy: Problems and Practices for an Emerging Service Industry </a>(Routledge, 2014), Tim Anderson explores how the music industry is changing from selling records as its primary purpose to a new paradigm in which artists must be entrepreneurial, audiences are end users, and record companies are investing in music brands, not simply records. Anderson&#8217;s book is a great guide for this new world. In his book, he draws on a wide range of examples from Moby and Lupe Fiasco to Amanda Palmer and Jonathan Coulton. He also introduces readers to the role that music supervisors, such as Alexandra Pastavas, are playing in film and television.<br />
<a href="http://ww2.odu.edu/al/comm/facstaff_Anderson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Tim Anderson</a> is an associate professor at Old Dominion University in the Department of Communication and Theatre Arts. He is also the author of Making Easy Listening: Material Culture and Postwar American Recording. Dr. Anderson can be contacted at <a href="mailto:tjanders@odu.edu">tjanders@odu.edu</a>.

		<itunes:subtitle>John Nathan Anderson’s new book, Radio’s Digital Dilemma: Broadcasting in the 21st Century (Routledge, 2014), documents the somewhat tortured path of broadcast radio’s digital transition in the United States.</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/academics/faculty/faculty_profile.jsp?faculty=1122" target="_blank">John Nathan Anderson&#8217;s</a> new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415656125/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Radio&#8217;s Digital Dilemma: Broadcasting in the 21st Century</a> (Routledge, 2014), documents the somewhat tortured path of broadcast radio&#8217;s digital transition in the United States.  Beginning his analysis with rise of neoliberal communications policy in the 1980s, Anderson charts the development of the idea of digitalization by closely examining two key archival sources: The <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Communication Commission&#8217;s</a> extensive archive of rulemaking and public comments and the archives of the two most important trade journals in broadcast radio, <a href="http://www.radioworld.com/index" target="_blank">Radio World</a> and <a href="http://www.current.org/" target="_blank">Current</a>.<br />
As Anderson explores in the book, FCC regulatory neglect coupled with the huge consolidation within the radio industry following the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 resulted in a digital transition that was dictated largely by commercial interests.  For example, the most important decision about digital radio &#8211; the engineering standard for digital broadcasting &#8211; was determined by a federation of corporations that formed a proprietary standard called <a href="http://hdradio.com/" target="_blank">HD Radio</a>.  This new digital standard was a failure on a number of levels, argues Anderson.  First, it was at odds with the global digital radio standard, Eureka 147.  Second, it caused unwanted interference with analog radio signals.  Third, the corporate entity which owned the rights to the HD Radio standard, iBiquity, was determined to charge local stations a fee for using its digital radio standard.  Once digital radio began to roll out across the nation in 2002, local stations&#8217; and listeners&#8217; complaints about interference and bad reception were effectively drowned out by a sustained marketing effort on behalf of HD Radio&#8217;s corporate partners.  Today, the future of digital radio in the United States is in doubt: only 13% of all stations are broadcasting a digital signal.  Throughout the book, Anderson argues that the lack of regulatory guidance and oversight, coupled with blind allegiance to market forces, has resulted in a radio environment that falls well short of our aspirations for a democratic media system.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The continued growth of online gaming and virtual worlds has effects not only in the analog world, with games and social media organizations taking stock options public, but also in the worlds created online. Many games and platforms allow users to involve themselves in virtual labor, to own property, and most importantly to make purchases. This one of areas where the analog and virtual crossover. And the question for platform providers becomes how to capitalize on user interest while earning money. In the new book <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/virtual-economies">Virtual Economies: Design and Analysis</a> (MIT 2014), <a href="http://vili.lehdonvirta.com/">Vili Lehdonvirta</a>, a research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, at the University of Oxford and <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~telecom/people/faculty/castronova.shtml">Edward Castronova</a>, professor of communications and cognitive science at Indiana University provide a detailed examination of the underpinnings and motivations for the creation of virtual economies. Lehdonvirta and Castronova consider various international examples to provide a comprehensive look at the markets that continue to be embedded into all kinds of online, and offline, interactions.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.easternct.edu/~russellj" target="_blank">Jim Russell</a> is a sociologist and it was his encounter with the hidden realities of his own 401(k) retirement plan that touched off his crusade to demystify for himself, and then others, just what was at stake in the options presented by private and public retirement plans. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0807012564/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Social Insecurity: 401(k)s and the Retirement Crisis</a> (Beacon Press, 2014), he puts into plain language for ordinary Americans the arcane terminology used by retirement-fund managers, and uses his own real-life experiences to build an empathetic bond with anxiety-laden readers.<br />
Russell moves seamlessly between the personal and political, the present and past, the domestic and global. The holism of his sociology is Russell&#8217;s strongest suit. With admirable succinctness and clarity&#8211;this is economics for the-rest-of-us&#8211;he recounts the Chicago-school economics that spawned the right-wing privatization movement. He then situates in the emergence of neoliberalism the corporate campaign to move billions of dollars from American pension accounts under pubic and labor union control into private hands.<br />
Turns out, the privatization of pension funds is not just an accompanying feature of global neoliberal strategy but the bull&#8217;s eye of the target, ground zero of the attack on centrally planned economies like Chile&#8217;s under Allende, and the former Soviet Republics.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/profile/brett-scott" target="_blank">Brett Scott</a> is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0745333508/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Heretic&#8217;s Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money</a> (Pluto Press, 2013). Scott is a journalist, urban deep ecologist, and Fellow at the Finance Innovation Lab.  While much of Scott&#8217;s book focuses on explaining various aspects of the financial services section, the heart of the book is a call to action. Scott infuses this call with a variety of first-hand experiences as a campaigner for radical approaches to disrupt the sector. For this reason, the book acts as a guide to activism, applicable for those interested in global finance, but also other domains that are ripe for criticism.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Americans are very politically divided. Democrats say we need a more powerful welfare state while Republicans say we need to maintain the free market. The struggle, we are constantly informed, is one of ideas. And that it is in the worst possible sense, for neither the Democrats nor Republicans seem interested in evidence. They don&#8217;t want the facts to get in the way of their arguments.<br />
In his remarkable book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1107644429/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Political Economy of Human Happiness: How Voters&#8217; Choices Determine the Quality of Life </a>(Cambridge University Press, 2013), <a href="http://politicalscience.nd.edu/faculty/faculty-list/benjamin-radcliff/" target="_blank">Benjamin Radcliff</a> provides facts that should help both Democrats and Republicans, despite their many differences, decide how to proceed. He asks a simple, compelling question: do conservative or liberal public policies make people happier? After an extensive and sophisticated analysis of the data, he reaches an equally simple, compelling answer: liberal policies do.<br />
Radcliff is a great friend of the free market; it is obvious, he says, that capitalism is the best economic system we have at our disposal. But he is also pragmatic: all the evidence shows that free markets alone don&#8217;t make people as happy as markets combined with robust welfare and labor-protection programs. There is a lesson here for both Democrats and Republicans. Listen up.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Much of the progress in technology today has come about as a result of innovators who did not seek prior approval from regulatory bodies and such. Yet, even with the beneficial results from innovations like the commercial Internet, mobile technologies, and social networks, a disposition exists to be overly cautious with respect to new things.  <a href="http://mercatus.org/adam-thierer" target="_blank">Adam Thierer</a> calls this the &#8220;precautionary principle&#8221; in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0989219348/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Permissionless Innovation: The Continuing Case for Comprehensive Technological Freedom</a> (Mercatus Center, 2014). The &#8220;precautionary principle&#8221;&#8211;which, Thierer argues, is based on fear and concern about loss of control&#8211;limits the creativity inherent in unfettered tinkering. In contrast, Thierer advocates &#8220;permissionless innovation,&#8221; an attitude that would allow experimentation to continue without hinderance. Of course does not mean that there is no use for policies for new technology, as some developments require regulation. Policymakers should, however, take a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach to setting rules for innovative products.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/" target="_blank">Nicholas Carnes</a> is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/022608714X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">White-Collar Government: The Hidden Role of Class in Economic Policy Making </a>(University of Chicago Press, 2013). Carnes is an assistant professor of public policy in the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University.<br />
There is surprisingly little in the research literature on the link between social class and legislative behavior. For a topic that seems so ripe for investigation, Carnes&#8217; data collection and analysis open new ground and answer pressing questions. He shows that formerly blue collar workers who serve in Congress behave differently than formerly white collar workers. Blue collar workers are in the extreme minority in numbers, meaning their efforts to pass legislation that tilts towards the working class are often stymied. Carnes offers fresh insight into why this matters for representation more generally and several recommendations for how to rectify this in the future.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In 1927 Russian-American legal theorist Alexander Sack introduced the doctrine of &#8220;odious debt.&#8221; Sack argued that a state&#8217;s debt is &#8220;odious&#8221; and should not be transferable to successor governments after a revolution, if it was incurred without the consent of the people; and not for their benefit.<br />
This doctrine has largely been rejected, with a firm presumption of &#8220;sovereign continuity&#8221; emerging instead: post-revolutionary governments must repay sovereign debt even if it was incurred to cover the personal expenses of plutocrats. If they fail to do so, their credit reputation is harmed. As <a href="http://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/faculty/bio.cfm?id=419" target="_blank">Odette Lienau</a> explains in a striking line, &#8220;we can now imagine prosecuting the leaders of a fallen regime for crimes against a state&#8217;s population while simultaneously asking that population to acknowledge and repay the fallen regime&#8217;s debts.&#8221;<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674725069/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Rethinking Sovereign Debt: Politics, Reputation, and Legitimacy in Modern Finance</a> (Harvard University Press, 2014), Lienau unfolds the historical conditions from which this seeming inconsistency emerged. Seamlessly moving between case studies from the early 20th century to the present, Lienau discusses several different versions of this puzzle. Ultimately, Lienau ends up rejecting &#8220;sovereign continuity,&#8221; and arguing for the recognition of &#8220;principled default.&#8221;<br />
With revolutions and uprisings across the Middle East, and in Ukraine, this book&#8217;s argument will likely provoke lively discussion among lawyers, economists, political theorists, and historians. But lay people should ideally engage with the ideas as well. The book gives an extraordinary point of access into what is at stake in the work of enormous international organizations, such as the World Bank.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The British Marxist economist Maurice Dobb is now largely forgotten. That&#8217;s too bad for a number of reasons. He was a brilliant thinker who wrote some of the most insightful analyses of the development and workings of capitalism around. You can still read his work and profit. He was the intellectual godfather of several notable British Marxist historians of the &#8220;New Left&#8221; of the 1960s and 1970s: Rodney Hilton, Christopher Hill, E.P. Thompson, among others. And, perhaps most importantly, his life gives us a window into a forgotten time, one in which a economists took communism seriously and fellows at Cambridge could earnestly believe in a bright communist future. This, I think, is a time we must not forget.<br />
Thanks to  <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/graduate/Shenk.html" target="_blank">Timothy Shenk</a>&#8216;s well-researched, readable biography <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1137297018/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Maurice Dobb: Political Economist</a> (Palgrave-Macmillan, 2013), we won&#8217;t have to. Shenk tells Dobb&#8217;s tale in all its tortured complexity. A member of the establishment and an anti-establishmentarian. A dyed-in-the-wool Marxist and a deadly serious empirically-oriented economist. A supporter of the Soviet Union and a critic of Soviet power. Listen in.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[The cultural and material history of what is fashionable or &#8220;trendy&#8221; can be particularly revealing about the time period under study. The most recent work that underscores this point is <a href="http://history.sunysb.edu/blog/jenniferanderson/" target="_blank">Jennifer Anderson</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674048717/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Mahogany: The Cost of Luxury in Early America</a> (Harvard University Press, 2012).  Anderson traces the popularity of mahogany wood in the mid eighteenth century from its use in England&#8211;a matter of necessity due to wood shortages&#8211;to its elective use in the American colonies among elite classes as a measure of cultural and social refinement. Unlike ephemeral goods like sugar and tobacco (which were purchased by elites but consumed and discarded shortly thereafter) mahogany was something solid, something lasting, something passed down to subsequent generations. Social engagements revolved around mahogany.<br />
Elites coveted the intricate and ornate furnishings, which because of mahogany&#8217;s incredible density, could only be crafted with mahogany. Even the middling classes would indulge in purchasing a mahogany piece, if the financial possibility presented itself. To be sure, this book offers much more than a dissection of the social and cultural worlds of Early America. Anderson tells the darker, often hidden story, of human and environmental exploitation. Following mahogany from the slave hands that felled the trees in the West Indies to the polished products decorating the posh estates of the wealthiest colonists offers a unique insight into a dynamic range of historical characters. By doing so, Professor Anderson deftly blends the social story with the environmental history and the history of capitalism.<br />
Jennifer L. Anderson is Associate Professor of History at State University of New York, Stony Brook. Her current research focuses on reinterpreting the human and environmental history of Long Island within the broader Atlantic context.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

The book offers a nuanced look at globalization, bringing to light the tensions and productivities that emerge when a highly powerful, historically localized industry enters the world of multinational capitalism.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.english.udel.edu/people/Pages/bio.aspx?i=61" target="_blank">Kevin Kerrane</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1492765074/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Dollar Sign on the Muscle: The World of Baseball Scouting</a> (CreateSpace, 2013) represents the first major study of the history and practice of professional baseball scouting.  Based on Kerrane&#8217;s ethnographic research with the Philadelphia Phillies during the 1981 season, the book provides an inside look at one of sports&#8217; least understood professions and most unusual subcultures. Originally released in 1984, the book became a cult favorite among baseball analysts and historians, eventually finding a place on Sports Illustrated&#8216;s list of the top 100 sports books of all time.  For the past decade the book has been notoriously hard to find, with copies selling for up to $50 on eBay.  It is now widely available in rerelease from Baseball Prospectus, the leading voice in progressive, contemporary baseball research. In addition to the original text, the rerelease features a new introduction and an extended epilogue updating the book for the 2010s.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0199752176/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Branding the Nation: The Global Business of National Identity</a>, <a href="http://www.melissaaronczyk.com">Melissa Aronczyk</a> locates the rise of nation branding as a response to the perceived need to sculpt national identity in the face of a fiercely competitive global economy. In tracking the history of the nation-branding phenomenon, Aronczyk recounts the rise and spread of the very idea of national &#8220;competitiveness,&#8221; a discourse that, in effect, created a market that branding specialists then tapped. The book engages with the large scholarly literature on nations and nationalism, arguing that nation branding should not be dismissed as merely the invasion of business practices into the national imaginary&#8211;though it has this character, undeniably&#8211;but that the practice should also be read as a discourse that maintains, extends, and reconstitutes the nation. Based on dozens of interviews with nation-branding specialist over a five-year period, Aronczyk develops major case studies of Poland and Canada in particular, and substantial treatments of a number of other cases spanning the globe, including Botswana, Chile, Estonia, Georgia, Jamaica, and Libya. In Branding the Nation, Aronczyk tells the story of how national identity came to be seen, and sold, as a form of added value in a competitive global market, and how these campaigns fed back into the ongoing process of thinking, and imagining, the nation.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~pmirowsk/" target="_blank">Philip Mirowski</a> is author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1781680795/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Never Let A Serious Crisis Go To Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown</a> (Verso Books 2013). Mirowski is the Carl Koch Chair of Economics and the History of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He&#8217;s previous authored Science-Mart, Machine Dreams, and More Heat than Light.<br />
Mirowski brings his broad background as an economist, historian, and philosopher to this meaty subject. He weaves together a stinging critique of the ways many economists reacted to the recent economic crisis with a larger discussion of the nature of economic ideas in politics. He highlights the rise of the Mont Pelerin Society and its links to what he dubs the Neoliberal Thought Collective. Rather than resting on broad generalities, he distinguishes between famed neoliberals to show how, for example, Milton Friedman and George Stigler approach their advocacy in very different ways.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[While it has become typical to see Filipina/o migrants working in nursing or domestic work in the United States, many are surprised to see Filipina/os doing the same work in Hong Kong, Israel, and Dubai. Indeed, Filipina/o workers are ubiquitous around the globe, and may be the world&#8217;s first truly global labor force. In <a href="http://robynrodriguez.com/" target="_blank">Robyn Rodriguez</a>&#8216;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0816665281/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Migrants for Export: How the Philippine State Brokers Labor to the World</a> (University of Minnesota Press, 2010),Rodriguez explores labor brokerage as a global capitalist strategy wherein the Philippine state mobilizes its citizens and sends them abroad to work for employers throughout the world while generating profit from the remittances that migrants send back to their families and loved ones remaining in the Philippines. Rodriguez traces this trend in Filipina/o overseas workers, which has become one of the largest labor export systems in the world. Ultimately, she questions how and why citizens from the Philippines have come to be the most globalized workforce on the planet, and argues that the reason for this lies in the emergence of the Philippine state as a labor brokerage state.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

OK, maybe not . . . but <a href="http://www.providence.edu/HISTORY/Pages/faculty.aspx" target="_blank">Sharon Murphy</a>&#8216;s book on the development of the life insurance industry in the United States from its infancy in the early republic through its breakthrough as a mass industry during the Civil War might make you change your mind. Deeply researched but also deeply entertaining (really!), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1421411946/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Investing in Life: Insurance in Antebellum America</a> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010; paperback, 2013) describes how the early pioneers of the insurance industry figured out how to sniff out frauds, figure mortality tables, market themselves to a suspicious population, and tap into middle class hopes and anxieties &#8212; especially middle-class Americans reticence about thinking about death (their death, at least). Investing in Life will change what you think about the history of business in the United States.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.city.ac.uk/arts-social-sciences/academic-staff-profiles/professor-george-brock">George Brock</a> approached his book about newspapers and journalism in the digital age unwilling to write another gloom-and-doom narrative about the death or decline of the industry. When he studied the historical development of journalism and current trends, he found the industry is what is always has been: volatile, evolving, and vital to society&#8217;s well being.<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0749466510/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Out of Print: Newspapers, Journalism and the Business of News in the Digital Age</a> (Kogan Page, 2013) is an important look at the industrial, economic, and pragmatic realities of a shifting industry. Using modern case studies, including the phone-hacking scandal that brought down Great Britain&#8217;s News of the World, as well as historical research and recent data, Brock examines where journalism was, is and will be.<br />
Brock, head of City University London&#8217;s prestigious graduate school of journalism, has produced a work that transcends academia without sacrificing methodology or theory.<br />
&#8220;Because journalism lives on the frontier between democratic purposes and the commercial market,&#8221; Brock writes, &#8220;it is constantly being reorganized and renegotiated.&#8221;<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Over the last several podcasts, authors (Stedman Jones, Buchman, and Tienken) have repeatedly evoked neoliberalism. A new book helps to place this term and its meaning in American political history into better context. <a href="http://newamerica.net/user/91" target="_blank">Michael Lind</a>, the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061834807/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States</a> (Harper, 2012), has written a sweeping economic and political history of the United States. He is cofounder of the New American Foundation and policy director of the foundation&#8217;s Economic Growth Program.<br />
Lind argues that the important divide in the economic intellectual history of the country is between the &#8220;developmental tradition&#8221; of Hamilton and the &#8220;producerist vision&#8221; of Jefferson. Major social, political, and economic eras have been defined by competing arguments and victories along that age old argument. Lind takes us up through the present and calls on the Next Social Contract to adjust to the new economic realities of the 21st century.<br />
Lind brings a journalist&#8217;s style and a wonk&#8217;s zeal for detail and argument. His book is provocative and accessible to a wide audience.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[In the &#8220;Great Recession,&#8221; millions lost their jobs, retirement savings, and even their houses. The entire middle class was shaken. Yet almost no one has been brought to justice. Quite the opposite: the big banks and investment houses&#8211;the places where the perpetrators most likely work and worked&#8211;were bailed out by the federal government under the banner of being &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; Perhaps it&#8217;s the case that we will never know enough about what happened to indict anyone, or at least anyone in the upper reaches of the financial industry. But does that mean we don&#8217;t, in a general way, know who was responsible?<br />
Not according to <a href="http://hedricksmith.com/" target="_blank">Hedrick Smith</a>. In his new book  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0812982053/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Who Stole the American Dream?</a> (Random House, 2012), the veteran reporter digs deep into American political and economic history to find out who we should blame for this colossal economic meltdown. What he found is surprising. The roots of the crisis go back farther than most people&#8211;experts included&#8211;think. Sure the bankers were involved, but so were politicians (including, of all people Jimmy Carter)&#8211;a lot of them. According to Smith, there&#8217;s plenty of blame to go around, at least in corporate boardrooms and the corridors of power in Washington.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When you buy a stock, you&#8217;re buying a piece of a company. The funny thing is that most people who own stocks either don&#8217;t know that or, if they do, don&#8217;t act like owners. They could care less about the business itself. They don&#8217;t care whether it turns a profit, how big that profit is, or whether they are going to get a cut of the profit. All they care about is the stock price: up = good; down = bad. According to portfolio manager <a href="http://www.federatedinvestors.com/FII/portfolioManagement.do?id=14025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Peris</a>, this narrow-minded focus on stock price is a real problem both for companies and the folks like you and me who invest in them. What everyone should be paying attention to, says Peris, is how much companies pay out in dividends to investors. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071769609/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Strategic Dividend Investor: Why Slow and Steady Wins the Race</a>(McGrawHill, 2011), Peris lays out the case to investors, urging them to invest in companies that distribute dividends regularly. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0071818790/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Dividend Imperative: How Dividends Can Narrow the Gap between Main Street and Wall Street</a> (McGrawHill, 2013), he lays out the case to the companies themselves, urging them to stop using their cash to buy their own stock back and instead reward investors with dividends. According to his convincing analysis, a return to dividend payment will benefit both corporations and investors. Listen in and find out why.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When I was an undergraduate, I was taught that merchants in early modern Western Europe were &#8220;proto-capitalists.&#8221; I was never quite sure what that meant. If it meant they traded property for money, yes. But that would make everyone who traded things for money over the past, say, 5,000 years, a &#8220;proto-capitalist.&#8221; If it meant that they thought of their property as capital to be used for maximizing profit, then no. As <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/faculty/Howell.html" target="_blank">Martha C. Howell</a> points out in her excellent  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521148502/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Commerce Before Capitalism in Europe, 1300-1600</a> (Cambridge UP, 2010), early modern merchants&#8211;at least in the Low Countries&#8211;didn&#8217;t really think of their property as &#8220;capital&#8221; at all, and they certainly didn&#8217;t use it exclusively for the maximization of profit. Their idea of property was, according to Howell, as much medieval as modern. Essentially, they adapted received (medieval) categories of property to novel commercial conditions. The result was a unique hybrid of the old and new. In hindsight, their understanding of property might seem &#8220;proto-capitalist.&#8221; But really it was just the way they conceived of property.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/growing-apart-a-political-history-of-american-inequality/index"></a>Americans seem to be more concerned about economic inequality today than they have been in living memory. The Occupy Movement (&#8220;We are the 99%&#8221;) is only the most visible sign of this growing unease. But what are the dimensions of inequality in the United States? How have they changed over the past century? Are we living in a new Gilded Age in which the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting richer?<br />
In his &#8220;book&#8221; (it&#8217;s really an innovative website)   <a href="http://scalar.usc.edu/works/growing-apart-a-political-history-of-american-inequality/index" target="_blank">Growing Apart: A Political History of American Inequality</a>   (Institute for Policy Studies, 2013), <a href="http://clas.uiowa.edu/history/people/colin-gordon" target="_blank">Colin Gordon</a>   sets out to answer these questions. Using an interesting array of charts, graphs, and videos, Gordon tells the story of inequality in the U.S. in modern times. Gordon shows that in recent decades the poor have been getting relatively poorer and the rich have been getting relatively richer. The &#8220;gap&#8221;&#8211;already considerable&#8211;is growing.<br />
In this interview we discuss growing inequality and the reasons behind it. We also touch on what is perhaps the most important question in the debate: does inequality as it is found in the U.S. really matter economically, spiritually, and politically?<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I&#8217;m Al Emid and I&#8217;m back here on New Books Network after a long absence. I had a good excuse though &#8211; I was finishing up the book entitled Investing in Frontier Markets, to be released this Fall by John Wiley &amp; Sons and co-authored with Gavin Graham. Barring unforeseen circumstances I will be back here regularly with reviews of timely books in the investing and business categories, which I&#8217;ve covered for years as a journalist.<br />
And in the business news category, firings, layoffs and forced resignations have occurred frequently for the past five years. Anyone who has recently lost what seemed like a secure job can be forgiven for wondering where he or she went wrong &#8211; but in many cases the fault did not lay with the terminated employee. And we can understand how any individual who has fulltime employment might wonder how long that will last. In the past year, blue-chip employers have terminated thousands of employees: 2400 at Dow Chemical, 5400 at American Express, over 4300 at Bank America and even 4000 at Google. The list goes on: United Technologies, Thomson Reuters, Proctor &amp; Gamble and others. And declining revenues don&#8217;t always explain the layoffs. In late May ESPN confirmed plans to lay off 400 employees despite an increase in operating income of 8%. ESPN had not had any layoffs since 2009. And we know that positions in the executive suite have become equally uncertain. So in the face of all of this how does one survive? <a href="http://www.suzenfromstein.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suzen Fromstein</a> offers some clues in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CULF4D0/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suits and Ladders: Ten Proven Ways to Keep Your Job Safe</a> (Carrick Publishing, 2013) and it contains what she describes as universal survival strategies. Her book is on Amazon Kindle in ebook and paperback versions. Suzen fesses up and says that her own failure to keep her job inspired her book.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[It&#8217;s a classic historical question: Why the West and not the Rest? Answers abound. So is there anything new to say about it?<br />
According to  <a href="http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/history/faculty/alphabetical/parthasarathi_prasannan.html" target="_blank">Prasannan Parthasarathi</a>, there certainly is. He doesn&#8217;t go so far as to say that other proposed explanations are flat out wrong, it&#8217;s just that they don&#8217;t really focus on the narrow forces that, well, forced English business men to innovate in the 18th century. In  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521168244/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Why Europe Grew Rich and Asia Did Not: Global Economic Divergence, 1600-1850</a> (Cambridge University Press, 2012), Parthasarathi says that those forces were economic. English textile merchants were getting trounced by imported Indian cotton. They found that they couldn&#8217;t produce cotton goods in the same way the Indians did for all kinds of reasons. So, they had to create a new, more efficient, production process. They did. According to Parthasarath, the &#8220;Industrial Revolution&#8221; was born out of economic competition and innovation (with, of course, a helping hand from the state). That makes a lot of sense.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/author.php?id=1382" target="_blank">Daniel Stedman Jones </a>is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691151571/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics</a> (Princeton University Press, 2012). The book tells a portion of the intellectual history of neoliberalism through a focus on the period of the 1950s through the 1980s. Stedman Jones tracks the development of a set of ideas by Karl Popper, Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, and later Milton Friedman, George Stigler, and James Buchanan, first in Europe and then in the United States. This intellectual movement soon becomes a transatlantic political movement, as the leaders of the neoliberal agenda sought to influence policy makers in the UK and US. Policy making in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly deregulation and other market-based reforms, reflected the success of the &#8220;masters of the universe&#8221; to move beyond the academy. The book ends with a reflection on the legacy of neoliberalism in current times. Scholars in political science, public policy, history, and economics would all benefit from the story Stedman Jones tells about the relationship between the history of ideas, politics, and policy. The book was short-listed for the Royal Historical Society, Gladstone Prize.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Their answer to the first question is (to put it in my own words) that we don&#8217;t know any better. Our competitive capitalist culture has taught us to work hard so we can earn more. Further, it has taught us that earning more will be &#8220;happier.&#8221; It won&#8217;t, say the Skidelskys. Their answer to the second question is &#8220;no,&#8221; full stop. What we should do instead is take advantage of our remarkable wealth, work less,  and live the good life. What is the &#8220;good life?&#8221; Listen in and find out.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

Mayer traces how the &#8220;TV producer&#8221; category came to be associated with&#8211;indeed defined by&#8211;creativity and professionalism. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0822350076/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Below the Line</a> upends this definition, through four empirical case studies of largely invisible television production: (1) television set assemblers in Brazil, (2) soft-core video cameramen in New Orleans, (3) reality TV casters, and (4) local cable television citizen regulators. The book weaves a theoretical thread through these ethnographic portraits that are themselves framed by political economic analysis of the industry and the broader economy. What once seemed stable&#8211;the idea that TV producers are above-the-line creative professionals&#8211;lies in elegantly written tatters by the book&#8217;s conclusion.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[If it doesn&#8217;t spread, it&#8217;s dead<br />
This is the unifying idea of Henry Jenkins, Sam Ford, and Joshua Green&#8217;s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814743501/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spreadable Media: Creating Value and Meaning in a Networked Culture</a> (New York University Press, 2013) Those six words &#8211; If it doesn&#8217;t spread, it&#8217;s dead &#8211; appear on the back cover, on the inside jacket, and in the very first paragraph of the book&#8217;s introduction.<br />
The authors focus on the new currencies of media, including user engagement and the rapid flow of information, while debunking the terms we&#8217;ve all learned to know and dread, such as &#8220;viral&#8221; and &#8220;Web 2.0.&#8221;<br />
<a href="http://henryjenkins.org/">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sam_Ford">Ford</a>, and <a href="http://undercurrent.com/post/author/joshua-green/">Green</a> set an ambitious agenda, targeting not one but three audiences: media scholars, communication professionals, and those who create and share media and are interested in learning how media are changing because of it.<br />
&#8220;Perhaps the most impactful aspect of a spreadable media environment,&#8221; the authors write, &#8220;is the way in which we all now play a vital role in the sharing of media texts.&#8221;<br />

Murray</a> tells us how one Southern American city did it in the 18th and 19th centuries. Charleston was a city divided between free whites and enslaved African Americans. The whites felt insecure and, according to Murray, this is one of the reasons they founded and funded America&#8217;s first public orphanage. The white-only institution not only helped indigent parents and their children, but it also brought the city&#8217;s white population together in a way no other body did. It was an expression of civic humanity, but it was also an expression of white unity against the black masses. Listen to John tell the tale.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

After providing an extended background of the region, its religious institutions and perspectives, and on the history of temple fairs in general in Part 1 of the book, Part 2 moves into the economic, cultural, religious, and political dimensions that contribute to the &#8220;red fire&#8221; of temple fairs in Jinhua today. Cooper shows how the local fair can serve both as a Bakhtinian carnivalesque atmosphere (replete with elements of freak show and circus) and a site of everyday forms of resistance. The book also features a wonderfully detailed account of the arts of popular performance at the fairs, from small-cymbal narrative (xiaoluo shuo) to opera (wuju) competitions, and looks closely at the religious dimension of secular temple gatherings. Cooper&#8217;s lively voice infuses every page of the book and each moment of the interview.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[You wouldn&#8217;t know from the 2012 president race but the United States remains engaged in a fairly bloody conflict in Afghanistan. In addition to boots on the ground, we deploy scores of drones in Pakistan, Yemen and the Horn of Africa to keep Al Qaeda and its affiliates at bay. In the post-9/11 world does the US have any other option aside from semi-permanent war against non-state actors that operate in developing and/or failed states? <a href="http://trumanproject.org/about/people/staff/rachel-kleinfeld/" target="_blank">Dr. Rachel Kleinfeld</a> thinks American policymakers have viable options, alternatives and policies that can address the national security challenges of the 21st century.<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0692015639/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Let There Be Light: Electrifying the Developing World With Markets and Distributed Energy</a>, co-authored with <a href="http://www.cnas.org/node/5038" target="_blank">Drew Sloan</a>, (Truman National Security Institute, 2012), they reveal that &#8220;energy,&#8221; or the lack thereof, keeps many nations mired in poverty. To jump start-developing economies, Kleinfeld offers some relatively doable innovations to make energy plentiful. In so doing, failed states could very well become success stories or, at the very least, less likely to incubate poverty, lawlessness and threats to international security. In the same vein, Kleinfeld&#8217;s second book, Advancing the Rule of Law Abroad (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2012), offers additional policies to promote the rule of law in developing nations. In both cases, these books give viable policy solutions that address the national security challenges of the 21st century.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[What did money mean to the people of medieval Japan?<br />
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674060687/?tag=newbooinhis-20">Coins, Trade, and the State: Economic Growth in Early Medieval Japan</a> (Harvard University Asia Center, 2011), <a href="http://history.msu.edu/people/faculty/ethan-segal/" target="_blank">Ethan Segal </a> takes readers through a fascinating exploration of the politics, society, and culture of pre-1600 Japan. One of the wonderful things about this book is the extent to which Ethan Segal very carefully contextualizes early medieval Japan within a broader global history, situating this economic history in a network of relations with the Mongols and China. East Asianists, take note: Segal&#8217;s work is of great interest to those working beyond the field of economic history, and speaks to the history of foreign policy and relations, ideas of virtue, and social history as well. Written in a very fluid and accessible style, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0674060687/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Coins, Trade, and the State</a> is an excellent read for anyone interested in cultures of exchange and their histories.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Many of us in the western world don&#8217;t rely on bills and coins as much as we used to, yet the idea of cash money is still an ever-present constant in our minds. How often have you stopped to consider the idea of what &#8220;money&#8221; actually is on a larger scale, or where our changing habits could lead us? In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0306818833/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The End of Money &#8211; Counterfeiters, Preachers, Techies, Dreamers, and the Coming Cashless Society </a>(Da Capo Press, 2012), <a href="http://www.david-wolman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Wolman</a> examines our commitment to cash, its advantages and drawbacks, how it facilitates crime and poverty, even its health and environmental issues. With an engaging and accessible style he prompts us to rethink the notion of money, how it works, and what forms it could take in the future.<br />
Wolman starts with a short history of cash, beginning with the official introduction of paper money to the Chinese monetary system in the 13th century and Marco Polo&#8217;s reaction to it 100 years later. Next we follow him around the globe to get a cross-cultural picture of cash today &#8211; including explorations of the cultural heritage and emotional value of cash, of an increasing trend in developing countries of people using their cellphones to transfer money to both businesses and family, and of counterfeiting and anti-counterfeiting technology. Along the way he enlists a wide variety of people to help illustrate these concepts: a Georgia pastor who views the end of cash as a sign of the End Times, a convicted counterfeiter (or &#8220;Monetary Architect&#8221;, depending on who you&#8217;re talking to), a coin collector with an ambivalent attitude toward coins, and a British &#8220;digital money guru&#8221; who views money as a menace.<br />
David Wolman is a contributing editor at Wired magazine. You can follow him on Twitter at @DavidWolman. He is, in his own words, a &#8220;&#8230;guy who&#8217;s interested in seemingly small, simple, straightforward topics that in fact, when you put them under the microscope, are anything but simple.&#8221; This book is an excellent example of that, and an engrossing read. In our interview he spoke of his year-long experiment to go without using coins or bills at all, the meaning of privacy and security as it relates to money in a digital world, and what he sees as the future of &#8220;money&#8221;.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Have you ever illegally downloaded a song from the internet? How about illicitly burned copies of a CD? Made a &#8220;party tape?&#8221; Bought a bootleg album? You may have done these things, but have you purchased a bootlegged song-sheet? In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226431835/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop Song Piracy: Disobedient Music Distribution Since 1929 </a>(University of Chicago, 2011) Barry Kernfeld fills us in on the history of disobedient music reproduction and distribution since, well, before the advent of recording technology. Along the way he discusses the above mentioned disobedient distribution techniques along with a few others: fake books, music photocopying, and pirate radio round out the book. Kernfeld suggests that the history of pop music piracy is never ending, with battles of different types of disobedience taking similar forms: the music &#8220;monopolists&#8221; (song owners) attempting to enact prohibitions on illegal production and distribution, the failed containment of said production and distribution systems and, finally, the assimilation of disobedient forms into the mainstream production and distribution industries.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<a href="http://histsci.wisc.edu/people/faculty/tilley.shtml" target="_blank">Helen Tilley</a>&#8216;s new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226803473/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Africa as a Living Laboratory: Empire, Development, and the Problem of Scientific Knowledge, 1870-1950</a> (University of Chicago Press, 2011) uncovers the surprising relationships that developed between science and empire as Britain attempted to fulfill its imperial projects in Africa. Focused primarily on Britain&#8217;s colonial dependencies, Tilley shows how the weakness of the empire and the complexity of Africa and of Africans transformed field studies into social and scientific laboratories conducting not merely scientific experiments but also experiments in epistemology, governance and disciplinary methods and aims. Tilley shows how what she calls &#8220;vernacular knowledge&#8221; circulated and affected metropolitan decision making, how understandings of ecology and complexity seemed to produce both epistemic and imperial humility and how some scientists were ambivalent about their participation research in states that were founded on white rule. Development, under all of its meanings, began long before decolonization, and Africa as a Living Laboratory shows us how imperial ambitions, expertise and experience transformed understandings of what was possible and how it would be best achieved.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[[Re-posted with permission from Jenny Attiyeh&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thoughtcast.org/" target="_blank">ThoughtCast</a>] <a href="http://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/detail.php?in_spseqno=198" target="_blank">Simon Johnson</a>, the Professor of Entrepreneurship at MIT&#8217;s Sloan School of Management, and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is an outspoken critic of the US government response to the financial crisis. Now he takes on the &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; banks which continue to threaten our economy.  In his latest book, called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/030747660X/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">13 Bankers: The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown</a> (Pantheon, 2010), which he co-wrote with James Kwak, Simon argues that if the biggest banks aren&#8217;t cut down to size, it&#8217;s only a matter of time before we face another financial crisis. And once again, the government &#8211; aka the taxpayers &#8211; will be obliged to step in and bail out these behemoths. In Simon&#8217;s words, if they&#8217;re too big to fail &#8212; they&#8217;re too big to exist!<br />
Simon Johnson is also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.  And he&#8217;s the co-author, again with James Kwak, of the influential economics blog <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/" target="_blank">The Baseline Scenario</a>. Simon spoke with <a href="http://www.thoughtcast.org/" target="_blank">ThoughtCast</a> at the Harvard Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[When I was in college I had a summer job once working in an aircraft factory. My task was to count screws. Nope, I&#8217;m not kidding. I put together parts-kits that were then taken to another station &#8220;down the line&#8221; for assembly. It wasn&#8217;t much fun, and it taught me that I did not want to pursue a career as a screw-counter.<br />
But it&#8217;s important to remember that the benefits of mechanical production are largely due to making work mechanical. To get all that cheap stuff we know and love, we have to turn what were once complex jobs into simple jobs. In his excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0801447267/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Condensed Capitalism: Campbell Soup and the Pursuit of Cheap Production in the Twentieth Century</a> (Cornell UP, 2009), Daniel Sidorick tells how the Campbell company made the cooking of soup&#8211;a magical art to many&#8211;into a mechanical process. The results were contradictory. On the one hand, soup became homogenous (though pretty tasty), portable, and very cheap. On the other, the soup-makers were made, as Marx might have put it, into appendages of soup-making machines. Management tried to make production lean and keep profits high; labor tried to keep work safe and wages high. But in the end, the two couldn&#8217;t make ends meet, at least in Camden: Campbell moved its production out of NJ in the 1980s. Not an unfamiliar story, I think, but still a very important one to tell and re-tell.<br />]]></itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I remember clearly the day I was offered my first credit card. It was in Berkeley, CA in 1985. I was walking on Sproul Plaza and I saw a booth manned by two students. They were giving out all kinds of swag, so I walked over to see what was to be had. T-shirts, I think. I asked them if I could get a credit card, sure that the answer had to be &#8220;no.&#8221; But the answer was an enthusiastic &#8220;yes.&#8221; I asked them if they understood that: a) I had no income beyond a tiny graduate student stipend; b) that I was carrying a debt from college that had been kindly &#8220;deferred&#8221;; and c) that my long-term prospects, money-making wise, were poor (the market in early Russian history degrees not being very hot). They said they didn&#8217;t know any of that, but it didn&#8217;t matter. All I had to do was to fill out a form and the card would arrive in the mail. I declined.<br />
As <a href="http://www.louishyman.com/bio">Louis Hyman</a> tells us in his excellent and important <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691140685/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Debtor Nation: The History of America in Red Ink</a> (Princeton UP, 2011), it wasn&#8217;t always so. Before the 1920s, most people could get no credit at all, least of all from a financial institution. But then, thanks to a confluence of odd interests, consumer credit expanded mightily. Companies that made expensive stuff (cars) and companies that handled large pools of idle money (banks) found, much to their surprise that if you lent ordinary folks large sums of money at moderate interest, they would pay it back. The producers and banks lent more; consumers borrowed and bought more; and, in turn, the producers and banks used higher profits to increase productivity, putting still more money in the pockets of consumers. And so the cycle continued, ultimately fostering the largest expansion in production and consumption the world had ever seen. Whether it will continue is a subject of some dispute today.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Today everybody wants to be a capitalist, even Chinese communists. It would be easy to think, then, that capitalism is &#8220;natural,&#8221; that there is a little profit-seeker in each one of us just waiting to pop out. There is some truth to this notion: humans are the most cooperative species on earth, and one of the most common ways we cooperate is through trade. Some form of &#8220;you scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours&#8221; lies at the heart of almost every human relationship. We are built for reciprocation, and we do it remarkably well.<br />
But, as <a href="http://www.ssc.ucla.edu/history/appleby/">Joyce Appleby</a> shows in her provocative, readable, and thoroughly entertaining <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393068943/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism</a> (Norton, 2010), the natural impulse for reciprocal back-scratching did not capitalism make. A set of very unusual historical forces did. These historical forces were not everywhere and always. On the contrary, they came together in one place at one time: Northwestern Europe in what we might call the &#8220;long modern period,&#8221; roughly the 15th though 18th centuries. Of course people in other places and other times traded, and even traded a lot. But they did not develop the culture of capitalism, that is, a set of values that suggested making money was good not only for the money-maker but for everyone else. Alexander Pope, one of the early apologists of capitalism, put the capitalist ethic this way: &#8220;Thus God and Nature link&#8217;d the gen&#8217;ral frame, and bade self-love and social be the same.&#8221; (An Essay on Man, 1733) Gordon Gekko, in the (anti-capitalist) film Wall Street (1987), put it more crudely: &#8220;Greed&#8230;is good.&#8221; Neither, it should be said, did pre-capitalist traders develop the institutions that make capitalism operate, that is, things like investment banks, credits, stock markets, insurance, and a whole host of government regulations (yes, government regulations) without which &#8220;free trade&#8221; could not be &#8220;free&#8221; at all. Caesar was not concerned about in the federal reserve. He didn&#8217;t even have a federal reserve to be concerned about.<br />
All of which leads to a single and startling conclusion: the culture and institutions of capitalism are Western. Thus when we in the West promote capitalism as the &#8220;best&#8221; way of going about things economic, we are engaging in a subtle form of cross-cultural persuasion. We may be right, capitalism may indeed be the best way to provision goods and services to the masses (I think it obviously is). But that doesn&#8217;t make capitalist culture any the less foreign to most of the world.<br />

		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[I confess I was attracted to this book by the title: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0691144788/?tag=newbooinhis-20" target="_blank">Capitalism and the Jews</a> (Princeton, 2010). Capitalism is a touchy subject; Jews are a touchy subject. But capitalism and the Jews, that&#8217;s a disaster waiting to happen. I don&#8217;t suggest you try this, but just imagine what would happen if you started a water-cooler chat with &#8220;Hey, what do you think of capitalism and the Jews?&#8221; Not pretty. So, being a bit curious, I wanted to know who would write a book with said title and what they could possibly say that wouldn&#8217;t get people calling for their head. Well, here&#8217;s what I found out. The book was written by <a href="http://history.cua.edu/faculty/Muller/">Jerry Muller</a> who, I can tell you with all earnestness, is a very bright fellow, an excellent (and witty) writer, and someone with a load of interesting things to say about capitalism and Jews. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not what you think. Muller&#8217;s book is no spittle-encrusted diatribe against greedy, hook-nosed, money-lenders. But neither is it the kind of book that ignores the (too often considered embarrassing or offensive) facts, the central one here being that Jews are, as Muller well puts it, good at capitalism. There is no Judeophobia or Judeophilia to be found in these pages. Rather, there is a fascinating, meditative, and enlightening account of the historical relationship of capitalism and the Jews, predominately in Europe over the last thousand or so years. This book is full of cool-headed, convincing arguments about controversial, oft-asked historical questions: Why are Jews good at capitalism? What made European Jews different from other diaspora communities? What role did the Jews play in the evolution of capitalism? What attracted some Jews to socialism? Why do we think&#8211;wrongly as it turns out&#8211;that there was an affinity between Jews and communism? How did Jews themselves react to the strong association between capitalism and their faith? How did Christians react to the same association?<br />
If you read this book, and I hope you do, you will be able to sensibly answer all these question. And really, you have no reason not to read it because it is a model of brevity. It&#8217;s rare that you find so much packed into so few pages. But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d expect, I suppose, out of a very bright fellow, excellent writer, and someone with a load of interesting things to say&#8230;<br />
