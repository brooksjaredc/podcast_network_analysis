      <title>"Talking Ableism, Hashtag Appropriation and Rom-Coms with Keah Brown"</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week, writer, journalist, and disability rights activist Keah Brown joins Ana for a difficult conversation about disability, ableism, and body positivity. Their wide-ranging conversation begins with Keah detailing how she’s worked to find self love and body positivity and a discussion on the lack of representation disabled people face in movies and popular culture writ large. They then turn to Keah’s desire not to be pigeonholed as a writer, and the pro’s and con’s of using Twitter to connect with other people. The conversation ends on an important note, when Ana apologizes for using ableist language, and the importance of looking at disability as something that is not static, but that comes in a variety of forms, as well as the need for privileged people to leave their comfort zones and be willing to make mistakes to expand their own horizons.</p><p>Then, Crooked Contributor Erin Ryan stops by to answer a listener question about navigating romantic relationships across a political divide. Ana and Erin come to the consensus that debating from similar source material, and talking to rather than past each other is essential. Sometimes to hear someone, you have to accept that you might not convince them you’re right. </p><p>Ana referenced several pieces Keah has written on the pod, which you can find below.</p><p>On the erasure of Stephen Hawking’s <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/stephen-hawking-free-from-his-wheelchair-ableist" target="_blank">disability</a></p><p>On the importance of <a href="https://femsplain.com/my-confidence-my-camera-phone-and-my-cerebral-palsy-1ae2da685e01" target="_blank">filters</a>, and <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/lipstick-empowerment-disability" target="_blank">lipstick</a></p><p>On the lack of representation of disabled <a href="https://catapult.co/stories/love-disability-and-movies" target="_blank">people</a></p><p>Get in touch with us at withfriendslikepod@gmail.com and on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/crooked_friends" target="_blank">@crooked_friends</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Check out our sponsors!</p><p>Get your body moving in your workspace at <a href="https://shop.fully.com/friends?utm_source=friends&amp;utm_medium=podcast" target="_blank">fully.com/friends</a>.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/?channel=podcast&amp;subchannel=dgitalmedia&amp;source=withfriendslikethese" target="_blank">squarespace.com/friends</a> for a free trial, and when you’re ready to launch save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain name with the offer code “friends.”</p><p>Turn your Pinterest board into reality with 25% off your design package at <a href="https://havenly.com/friends" target="_blank">havenly.com/friends</a>.</p><p>Go to <a href="https://www.getquip.com/affiliate?affiliate=friends&amp;utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_campaign=friends" target="_blank">getquip.com/friends</a> to get your first refill pack free with a Quip electric toothbrush.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>]]>

      <title>“The Average American White Racist” with Christian Picciolini</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>On the Season 1 finale, reformed extremist Christian Picciolini [4:02] joins Ana to talk about his experience as a white supremacist, how his mind changed, and the work he does today to show people that there is life after hate. They discuss the rise and shifts in white supremacy within the United States and the way that white supremacists have softened their image by using coded language and racial dog whistles. The conversation turns to the ways in which white supremacy is like an addiction, and the possibilities of treating them both through recovery, kindness, and empathy. He also shares his own perspective on how to confront white supremacy: not with violence, but by helping people identify and fill in the holes in their lives, and showing how they can change. Later on, Ana and Christian touch on one of the most important things to keep in mind when dealing with not just white supremacy but ordinary interactions with people in everyday life: everybody is going through something we can’t see. The conversation ends with what makes Christian worried, and hopeful, about the society we now live in. </p><p>Afterward, [58:43] Ana revisits last week’s episode about Black Panther, acknowledging the ways her own whiteness makes it impossible to fully grasp Wakanda’s decision to not take back Killmonger. </p><p>Thank you to everyone that has been a part of this podcast in some way for making it a wonderful first season.

      <title>“Karma Is A Magnificent B*tch” w/ Diana Butler Bass and Rick Wilson</title>

      <title>BONUS EPISODE: “Sometimes a Loss is More Powerful than a Win”</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In this special episode, Ana takes a field trip to Chicago to visit with a group of voters long misunderstood by the coastal elites but who played a pivotal role in the 2016 election: that’s right... Hillary voters. What makes them tick? Why do they have such affection for her? Will they continue to support her, no matter what? Also, we try to humanize them a bit: Hillary voters may seem different, but really, they’re just like you or me!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[— Trump agoniste Rick Wilson (@therickwilson) sheds some light on the chasm between how Trump loyalists and Trump skeptics will receive the Comey testimony.
— Quinta Jurecic (@qjurecic), associate editor at Lawfare, elaborates on the insight that gripped many Comey observers: His story parallels that of anyone who’s been the target of a sexual predator.
— Commentary editor Noah Rothman (@noahcrothman) helps field a listener question about a relationship that’s soured since the election.

Quinta brings up two relevant pieces: Alexandra Petri’s imagined transcript of Comey/Sessions chats https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/06/07/james-comey-is-this-man-bothering-you/?utm_term=.3006acd4459e

And this piece from Slate, about Comey’s written testimony as pulp fiction: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/06/07/james_comey_s_testimony_about_trump_and_the_russia_investigation_shows_off.html

(I also wrote my column on this subject, and you may hear me quote myself a bit: http://www.mtv.com/news/3019180/comeys-testimony-reminds-us-that-trump-is-a-predator/)

— Commentary editor Noah Rothman (@noahcrothman) helps field a listener question about a relationship that’s soured since the election.

Quinta brings up two relevant pieces: Alexandra Petri’s imagined transcript of Comey/Sessions chats https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2017/06/07/james-comey-is-this-man-bothering-you/?utm_term=.3006acd4459e

And this piece from Slate, about Comey’s written testimony as pulp fiction: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/06/07/james_comey_s_testimony_about_trump_and_the_russia_investigation_shows_off.html

(I also wrote my column on this subject, and you may hear me quote myself a bit: http://www.mtv.com/news/3019180/comeys-testimony-reminds-us-that-trump-is-a-predator/)

        <![CDATA[W. Kamau Bell (@wkamaubell), of CNN’s United Shades of America, joins to help a listener puzzle through how (and if) to have a relationship with her Trump-supporting parents. As he put it: Do they deserve the privilege of her children’s  company? Also: What Kamau’s TV show has taught him about a post-election America, and a primer on the *good* kind of white pride.

Kamau’s new book! The Awkward Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell: Tales of a 6' 4", African American, Heterosexual, Cisgender, Left-Leaning, Asthmatic, Black and Proud Blerd, Mama's Boy, Dad, and Stand-Up Comedian
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZXZK2F/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1

The theme song is by Ross Flournoy (@ApexManor) and we know that it sounds like the  90s. That’s exactly what we asked for.

        <![CDATA[This episode wound up being about the limits and costs of empathy. First up: Franchesca Ramsey (@chescaleigh), creator and star of the hilarious social justice (really, all of that!) series, “Decoded.” We discuss about what she still feels uncomfortable talking about and who she feels uncomfortable talking to. Second segment: National correspondent for The Atlantic Graeme Wood (@gcaw), whose profile of honest-to-god Nazi and high school classmate Richard Spencer wound up being closer to his usual beat — ISIS — than Wood ever thought it would be.

Wood is also the author of “The Way of the Strangers: Encounters with the Islamic State”: https://www.amazon.com/Way-Strangers-Encounters-Islamic-State-ebook/dp/B018PD2HIG/

Decoded: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnvZ3PbKApGM-hHuQ9lNc5oSKsusjn0Z6

“His Kampf: Richard Spencer is a troll and an icon for white supremacists. He was also my high-school classmate”: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/

We also dive into how leaving the conservative movement has changed how he thinks about social issues such as abortion. In the second segment, Brandy Jensen (@BrandyLJensen) helps us dispose of the question, “Is Ivanka a feminist?” Instead, we wonder if neoliberal feminism is itself the problem.
