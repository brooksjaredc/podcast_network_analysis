      <title>Jack Kornfield: Buddhism 101</title>
      <description>What is Buddhism? How could it help your daily life? Is it a religion? And what does the statue we always see really represent? Jack Kornfield, one of the leading Buddhist teachers in America, introduces the basic principles behind Buddhism, discusses the steps involved in mindful living and offers practical tips on how to grow your own spiritual practice. His teachings begin with the idea that people are born whole and good, and that later, they can choose to turn back to their innate goodness. Jack also shares his best advice on how to stay in the now, quiet your thoughts and lead a truly awakened life. Jack trained as a Buddhist monk in the monasteries of Thailand, India and Burma (now Myanmar). He has taught meditation internationally for decades and is one of the key people to introduce Buddhist mindfulness practice to the West. His best-selling books, including "The Wise Heart," "Living Dharma" and "No Time Like the Present," have been translated into 20 languages.</description>

      <title>Malala Yousafzai: What Is Your Defining Moment?</title>
      <description>In every life, there are defining moments when a person must decide whether to stand up for what is right or remain silent. At a young age, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai began boldly advocating for girls' access to education, which had been denied by the Taliban, an extremist Islamic group. The consequences were grave. In October 2012, the Taliban shot Malala point-blank in the head because of her outspoken beliefs. Miraculously, Malala survived and would go on to become the co-founder of the Malala Fund, which seeks to advocate and provide education to millions of young girls globally who are denied an education because of poverty, violence or tradition. Two years after the attack, Malala became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala describes to Oprah the last moment she remembers before being shot. The young activist says her recovery taught her that "there is nothing greater than the love and the prayer of people." Later in the podcast, Malala's father, Ziauddin, joins the discussion and explains why he felt closest to God on the day Malala was attacked.</description>

      <title>Carole Bayer Sager: Music as Prayer</title>
      <description>Oprah sits down with Carole Bayer Sager, the Grammy-, Golden Globe- and Oscar-winning singer/songwriter and painter, to discuss her legendary career. Carole shares the stories behind some of her biggest songs, including "That's What Friends Are For" and "The Prayer." One of the most prolific writers in pop history, Carole has worked with numerous legendary performers, such as Barbra Streisand, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Stevie Wonder. In her memoir, "They're Playing Our Song," Carole reflects on her spiritual journey both in and out of the recording studio, including her decadelong marriage to, and painful divorce from, composer and singer Burt Bacharach. She opens up about how her mother's harsh criticism of her weight led to lifelong emotional insecurity. Nevertheless, Carole says she found healing in her songwriting and believes that her life's purpose has always been to touch others' hearts through her work and to help them feel connected and less alone.</description>

      <title>Trevor Noah: Born a Crime</title>
      <description>In his interview with Oprah at the famed Apollo Theater in New York City, Trevor Noah, the late-night comedy host and best-selling author of "Born a Crime," discusses his childhood in South Africa, his mother who risked her life to raise him, and his unlikely path to becoming the host of "The Daily Show." Trevor shares inspiring stories about overcoming extreme poverty under apartheid. Oprah tells Trevor, "You're the only person I've interviewed, that I can remember, who's a famous person, who grew up poorer than I did." Trevor says, "We laughed. We enjoyed ourselves. We had something that sometimes you don't have when you have too much, and that's the ability to focus on the human beings around you." Trevor also explains the "black tax" that he writes about in his book. He tells Oprah, "It's one of the hardest conversations to have with people." In this special edition of "Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations," you'll hear Oprah and Trevor's full interview, featuring more than 15 minutes of bonus content not included in Part 1 of the OWN special "Oprah at the Apollo."</description>

Trevor also explains the "black tax" that he writes about in his book. He tells Oprah, "It's one of the hardest conversations to have with people."

      <description>Oprah sits down with Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling, her co-stars from the film "A Wrinkle in Time," for a lively conversation about ambition, guardian angels, learning to say no, and the pressures women face in today's culture. Reese and Mindy discuss the hardest decisions they had to make in order to fulfill their destinies. Oprah says, "I'm so excited to have a conversation with such beautiful, innovative, powerful women."&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Directed by pioneer filmmaker Ava DuVernay, "A Wrinkle in Time" is adapted from Madeleine L'Engle's classic 1962 novel of the same name.

      <title>Janet Mock: Redefining Realness</title>
      <description>Janet Mock, the transgender advocate, television host and New York Times best-selling author, discusses her powerful journey, the importance of speaking your truth, and becoming the person you know you were always meant to be. Janet offers insight into not only her transgender experience but also the importance of creating a vision for what is possible, and shows us how to see and accept one another through love. Janet's first memoir, "Redefining Realness," details her bold and inspiring perspective on being young, multicultural and transgender in America. Janet says her journey is similar to that of many people: "I think that we're all searching for the truth. I was constantly, as a person, going through this society trying to figure out who I was in relation to what people were telling me I should be. And so, for me, 'Redefining Realness' was about tapping into my most authentic self. Who am I to me?"</description>

      <title>Brian Grazer: The Secret to a Bigger Life</title>
      <description>From "A Beautiful Mind" to "Empire," Brian Grazer has produced some of the greatest films and television shows of the past 40 years. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Brian sits down with Oprah to discuss his book, "A Curious Mind: The Secret to a Bigger Life," in which he writes about how expanding our curiosity should be as much a part of our culture as creativity and innovation. Brian not only attributes his success to curiosity but also says it's his daily spiritual practice. "It does get me into the place of truth within the person I'm connecting with," he tells Oprah. "It's the deepest emotional connection." Plus, Brian reveals how to optimize your curiosity in order to live a more satisfying, connected and soulful life.</description>

      <title>Thomas Moore: A Religion of One's Own</title>
      <description>Religious scholar, psychotherapist and former monk Thomas Moore has dedicated his life to exploring the questions at the heart of theology. Thomas' classic 1992 book, "Care of the Soul," redefined spirituality in the modern age, and now he believes we are facing an exhilarating new phase of our spiritual evolution. Thomas and Oprah talk about ways to bring the soul and spirituality back into your life. While discussing his book "A Religion of One's Own," he explains the difference between the part of us that searches for more and the part of us that finds solace in what we have. His broad message resonates with those who see themselves as spiritual but not necessarily religious. Thomas’ latest book is called “Ageless Soul: An Uplifting Meditation on the Art of Growing Older” in which he describes how to live agelessly, embrace our time in life and find the endless joy nestled inside our soul. &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>RuPaul Charles: We’re All In Drag</title>
      <description>Underneath his over-the-top hair, makeup and outfits, RuPaul Charles believes that at the core “we’re born naked and the rest is drag.” It’s a radical way of interpreting who we are, but whatever we claim as our identity is considered our drag, he says. A pop culture fixture since the early 90s, RuPaul has preached a gospel of self-love and tolerance that has permeated American culture. Now more popular than ever, thanks to the success of his Emmy-award winning competition show “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” RuPaul shares what he believes is the authentic meaning of “identity,” and how we can all see past the stereotypes and labels to discover true connection with those around us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>Paul Williams and Tracey Jackson: A Better You Through Trust and Gratitude</title>
      <description>Paul Williams is the songwriting legend behind hits such as Barbra Streisand's Oscar-winning song, "Evergreen," Kermit the Frog's beloved "Rainbow Connection" and the Carpenters classic "We've Only Just Begun." Paul says that, at the height of his fame, an addiction to alcohol and drugs nearly destroyed him. After hitting rock bottom in a harrowing public meltdown, Paul got sober and started a difficult journey to discovering the true happiness he feels today. Together with author, director and screenwriter Tracey Jackson, Paul has written a book, "Gratitude and Trust," outlining six affirmations they say can help people become better versions of themselves. The co-authors claim that the affirmations work for fear-based habits like perfectionism, overeating, fear of intimacy and even smartphone obsession. Paul says, "When getting help was important enough for me to let go of ego and do it, I began to connect. And that connection, that brought me to life."</description>

      <title>Pema Chödrön: Dealing with Difficult Times </title>
      <description>Born in New York City, Pema Chödrön is one of the first Western women to be fully ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun. Pema explains how difficult times can be an opportunity for growth and change if you're willing to embrace the situation and the feelings that come with it. One of the basic Buddhist tenets, Pema says, is that change is constant. "Things are going to keep changing," she says. "If you're invested in security and certainty, then you're not going to feel good a lot of the time."</description>
