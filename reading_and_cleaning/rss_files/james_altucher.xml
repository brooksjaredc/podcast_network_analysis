And how anyone can adopt this process for their own projects or side hustles.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tyra Banks booked 25 fashion shows her first year being an “unknown.” That’s unheard of. She climbed to the top of an industry and consistently created new opportunities for herself. When “they” said she was getting too fat, she switched from high-fashion to commercial modeling. When “they” said her idea for a TV show was stupid, she found someone else and got a “yes.” Then she produced one of the highest rated reality TV shows “America’s Top Model.” She excelled in 150 countries. And created 25 international versions, too. And what was most impressive was that Tyra had her hands in all of it. She’s a true entrepreneur. And I’m so lucky to have learned from her.

			<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Adam Perlman is a TV writer, director and co-executive producer. We met on the set of Showtime's “Billions,” which I can now say I am a technical writer for. He's also written for some of my favorite shows like "The Newsroom" and "The Good Wife." Adam used to be a lawyer. But he went through this constant battle with himself on whether it’s “okay” to be an artist. Finally, the market collapsed. And there was no work for him in corporate law. So he spent his days writing and eventually landed a mentor, and a gig, and the story picks up from there. Adam Perlman’s a true example of the struggle a lot of us go through when we know we have some bigger dream... but don’t know if survival comes with that dream. So I look at Adam as living proof that it can be done.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jon Ronson writes about psychopaths. He created a test called "The Psychopath Test." And wrote about it. I had him on to learn what it means to be mad. He told me how to spot the signs (and how it starts to haunt you). He also told me stories. Lots of them. About kids trapped in mental hospitals. Secret cults planning to take over the world. His writing style is sort of humorist meets gonzo-esque journalism. He puts himself directly in the center of a conspiracy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Wolfgang Puck is a famous chef who has successfully created an empire in food. At age 14, he worked in his first restaurant. A few weeks in, he was fired. And contemplating suicide. Fast-forward, and Wolfgang became the first “celebrity chef.” He’s expanded his love of food in every single way: restaurants, cookbooks, catering (he’s catered the Oscars.) Now he also has a MasterClass available online.</p> <p>“I always wanted to be in charge of my own destiny,” he said. “I thought, ‘This is what I was born to do.” I don’t fully understand destiny. So I wanted to know. How could he actually feel that? How could he know? How could anyone know?</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Show Notes</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolfgang’s MasterClass - "<a href= "https://www.masterclass.com/classes/wolfgang-puck-teaches-cooking">Build Your Cooking Techniques</a>"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talk about some of his restaurants including:</span></p> <p><a href= "http://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/cut-new-york/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Cut </span></a></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href= "http://rogue-exp.com/">Rogue</a> (this one's in LA and only serves 10 people a night) </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href= "http://wolfgangpuck.com/dining/spago/">Spago</a> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric Ripert (famous chef)</span></p> <p><br /> <a href="%20http:/amzn.to/2FMw5YV"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Chef</span></a> (a movie starring Jon Favreau)</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Le Cirque</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billy Wilder (famous director)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ma Maison</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall by Pink Floyd</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serena Williams (tennis player)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Gehry (architecture)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picasso</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four Seasons</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freddy Rosen who started Ticketmaster</span></p> <p><strong>I write about all my podcasts!

			<title>320 - Steve Scott: How to Make $50K a Month Writing From Your Couch</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This podcast episode is action packed. It’s not philosophy. It’s action. It’s HOW to actually get to the top of Amazon’s best seller list, how to get an idea for your book, how to create daily writing habits, etc. Steve Scott has written 70+ books.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Wait! Before I say “comedian.” Let me tell you who Paul Mecurio really is. He’s a transformer. A true re-inventor. He started out at as a lawyer on Wall Street. Because it was logical. And he got used to making 2, 3… 4 million dollars a year (after bonuses vested). It was hard to give it up... at first.But he still made little efforts. And those efforts add up. Overtime Paul stopped taking notes in meetings. He wrote jokes instead.</p> <p>And then one day he got a chance to meet Jay Leno. And he started living a double life.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“It’s weird to do something that you didn’t really plan on doing,” Todd Barry said. He’s a comedian and actor. But he wanted to be a musician. “I didn’t go on stage with the conscious goal of pursuing comedy. In my mind, I still wanted to be in a band,” he said. “And at some point, I think it was like 8 months in where, I was like, ‘I guess I guess I’m doing this.’” I wanted to know what kept him going... It was simple.  “Weirdly, I don’t think I ever said ‘I’m thinking about quitting…’ which I guess is pretty telling.”</p> <p>Maybe that’s how you find your calling…</p> <p>By not quitting what you don’t hate, you create skill. And skill becomes love.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <p>Read Todd's book, "<a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Thank-Coming-Hattiesburg-Not-Quite-Biggest/dp/1501117424">Thank You for Coming to Hattiesburg: One Comedian's Tour of Not-Quite-the-Biggest Cities in the World</a>"</p> <p>Listen to Todd’s <a href= "http://www.feralaudio.com/111-judd-apatow/%20">podcast interview with Judd Apatow </a><br /> This is one of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cU3QLut44MY">my favorite jokes from Todd Barry</a><br /> Watch Todd in “<a href= "http://toddbarry.com/todd-is-on-jerry-seinfelds-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee/">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee</a>” with Jerry Seinfeld </p> <p><strong>I write about all my podcasts!

			<title>304 - Dov Davidoff: Vulnerability is Good. (It Can Set You Apart)</title>
			<pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to just be an entertainer, but it’s a lot harder to be an artist. Dov Davidoff is learning this.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you were on the outside looking in you’d probably think, 'This guy's got a really good life.' And on paper I did, but on the inside I felt like I was dying. I was depressed. I was unenthusiastic about my life because I knew I was in a career that was ill suited to me. But I just couldn’t see my way out of it,” Rich Roll said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told be about the time he felt a tightness in his chest. He couldn’t walk up the stairs. He had to take a break halfway up the flight.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich was 39 and dying.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich and I talked about his story before... how he transformed himself from a depressed and overweight alcoholic to a plant based, vegan eating, mega athlete / bestselling author / podcaster / writer and total peak performer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But THIS time we dove even deeper.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was trying to force this round peg into a square hole for most of my life," he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to understand the switch that led him to himself... He told me his secret. And I believe him.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Surrender."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went to rehab. And got help for a problem he couldn't handle on his own.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's Rich's meaning of "surrender." Getting help when you need.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it's hard to know when it's the right time to get help. I probably need help right now. It's the first time I've felt physically sick in five years. My body is tired. And I'm trying to rest. But sometimes, I can't pull myself away from what I love.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I talked to Rich and then my friend Ryan Holiday. And then prepped for two more interviews.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like this interview with Rich for a lot of reasons. I'll tell you one though... It's because when he says something, it feels just confessing. He's sharing what's true for him. And helping you heal in the process. (You'll know what I mean if you start listening)</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We all have vulnerabilities. And I exposed mine to Linda because it’s a free therapy session. She’s a well-known psychologist and bestselling author born in Canada, living in the UK.</p> <p>I had to ask her about all her theories. And all her books. But mostly these 2:</p> <p>1. “What Men Say, What Women Hear”<br /> 2. “Unfollow: Living Life on Your Own Terms”</p> <p>Because I am still outsourcing my self-worth to new measures. First, it was money. So I gave up Wall Street (for many reasons). And then it became book sales and now podcast downloads or laughs when I’m on stage doing stand up.</p> <p>And so I asked Linda “why?”</p> <p>Why am I sacrificing my art for identity?</p> <p>“We create because it’s in,” she said. “We’re social beings and our identity is bound up in what we create. That identity needs to be confirmed by others, right? It’s an interesting thing: identity. It’s simultaneously what makes us different but it’s also what binds us with a group”</p> <p>Then she told me about the evolution of acceptance.</p> <p>“Years ago you’d have a much smaller group validating that. Now, you have people out there, James, that don’t have a vested interest in you feeling good about yourself. Actually, there are people out there that would find it interesting if you didn’t. And you’ve got to ask yourself, ‘Is the source not important?’”</p> <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“It’s like a big bathroom door,” she said. All the comments on message boards or Facebook or Twitter…</p> <p>Think about this. You go to a public bathroom. And the door is covered in ink. Is any of it positive? Or even worth reading?</p> <p>That’s social media. (According to Linda.)</p> <p>She said, “Look at who’s giving you that validation and explore if it’s quality or quantity. And, maybe that’s that’s what we’ve sold our souls for... quantity.”</p> <p>Then she gave me tips. Really useful tips that I started practicing as soon as the podcast ended (like taking note of when I’m on social media, and how my mood is, and how much power someone else has). And then I asked her about women.</p> <p>She broke down all the reasons people get divorced. And the most common misunderstandings. And how to get rid of them for good.</p> <p>Because fighting hurts. It comes back to what Linda said about vulnerabilities. We all have them. And they’re impossible to forget. It’s like they put a mark on you. And follow you from place to place. Never letting you forget…</p> <p>(Linda gave me advice for that too.) “The vulnerabilities are there,” she said, “but the assets are the people that tell you it’s okay to have them…”</p>]]></description>

He had a gun to my head,” Jon said.  “We were leaving the country.  We got intercepted.”</p> <p>Wait.</p> <p>What?</p> <p>I was interviewing Jon Alpert.  He was trying to smuggle controversial footage out of Iraq.<br /> <br /> “I was basically a complete failure up until the moment that I started making films,” Jon said.</p> <p>He was constantly trying to make his community a better place, but his attempts were always unsuccessful.</p> <p>“I want to make this country better. And I’m not a good soldier. And I’m not a politician. So I can’t go represent in Congress, but I can be a good reporter,” he said.</p> <p>He took two passions (camera and country) and combined the two to become creative in the intersection.</p> <p>His documentaries show aspects of social change that I’ve never seen anywhere else. There’s this undercurrent of a larger problem... an issue or a cause that people are fighting for. I feel like, in talking to Jon, that I want to be fighting for something too. Jon had a core. A direction. And a destination. All in one.</p> <p>“The camera is a license for me to go up to you and to invade every single part of your life,” he said. “The camera is a license to invade people’s personal space.”</p> <p><br /> “And I’m doing it because I love my country and that’s how I believe I can be the best patriot.”</p> <p>He told me about his newest documentary, “Cuba and the Cameraman.” 45 years! It took him 45 years to make this.</p> <p>It’s his life work.</p> <p>He went through a thousand hours of footage. Editing took a year. And what resulted (what we finally get to see) is one of the greatest films about the Cuban Revolution. Ever.</p> <p>And this podcast is the story behind those stories. We hear about the leaders. The criminals. And what was inside their refrigerator.</p> <p>These are the war stories you don’t hear. This is the filmmaker's journey.</p>]]></description>

And what resulted (what we finally get to see) is one of the greatest films about the Cuban Revolution. Ever.</p> <p>And this podcast is the story behind those stories. We hear about the leaders. The criminals. And what was inside their refrigerator.</p> <p>These are the war stories you don’t hear. This is the filmmaker's journey.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started to get really itchy. Inside my head.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know how to scratch it. So I avoided it. Until I broke out into hives and finally forced myself on stage.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it started when I interviewed Gary Gulman, one of the greatest comedians ever. It was over two years ago. And even though he was deeply depressed, I was jealous.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because he was living my dreams. He was scratching my itch.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I started to interview more comedians. And writers of comedy. I had so many questions. I interviewed Jim Norton, Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson!) Fred Stoller, Chris Smith (who worked with Jon Stewart), Paul Shaffer (the famous band leader on Jay Leno), Bonnie McFarlane. The list keeps growing.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are so many branches of comedy:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand up, voice overs, writers, monologue performers, sidekicks. And each branch has its own microskills.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true for every skill. They all require you to learn hundreds of micro-skills.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So getting started can be scary. Very scary. Some people die with itches unscratched.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I want to get better at something, I go underneath the skill. I imagine a small version of myself looking up at my dreams. If I can see how far away I am from greatness, I feel the desire to get there. That’s what this podcast is about. Picking apart greatness.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackie Martling came to the studio. He was the lead writer at “The Howard Stern Show” for 18 years and now he’s the author of “The Joke Man Bow to Stern.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know anyone who’s looked at their crappy job and said “I’m going to do this for 18 years.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I wanted to hear him talk about what it’s like to love what you’re doing with your life. To feel good and dedicated.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where I hope to find us help. (I say “us” because I’m still itchy). I still want to be a standup comedian.

			<title>Ep. 293 - AJ Jacobs: Why We Experiment (And Why You Should Also)</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I like the idea of experimenting for two reasons. A) widen comfort zone B) become a better person.</p> <p><br /> I’ll tell you about A first then B.</p> <p><br /> But first, let me reintroduce my good friend AJ. If you listen to this podcast then you already know who AJ is. But just in case, AJ Jacob’s is a professional at experimenting. All his books are experiments. Four are bestsellers.</p> <p><br /> He told me about one he did with the comedian Jim Gaffigan. They looked up the oldest jokes in the world. From hundreds of years ago. And told them to live audiences today. Sometimes Jim bombed, some jokes he skipped (because a lot of jokes were about lettuce… lettuce used to be thought as an aphrodisiac), but others worked.</p> <p><br /> And he didn’t know what to expect.  </p> <p><br /> That’s A) widening your comfort zone.</p> <p><br /> So for this podcast, AJ and I came up with ideas to experiment with. And we want you to join us. You’ll hear what we’re testing right now. And what’s next. </p> <p><br /> I found that if I do a new experiment a day or week, it becomes a micro step to creating a healthy life. For example, I told AJ that I try very heard not to say anything bad about anybody. And it’s hard because things come up throughout the day. But ultimately it makes me feel happier to not gossip. And I’ve been doing this now for about seven years. AJ tried it too. “It was fascinating,” he said, “because I realized 70% of my speech was trash talking and it made such a difference in my life when I cut that out because it made me more positive and happier.”</p> <p><br /> And it’s true. Because we all know that eating trash makes you feel like trash. And it’s true for your brain too. </p> <p><br /> These are the nuances hidden in experimenting. You have a secret with yourself. A promise to uphold. And you live up to some unknown potential sometimes.</p> <p>That’s B.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You may remember Amy, she came on my podcast a few weeks ago. We discussed her book, “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do.”</p> <p>I asked her why is it a book about what people DON’T do instead of SHOULD do. It seemed counterintuitive to me.</p> <p>But her reasoning made sense. The book wasn’t written for other people. It was actually just a letter to herself at first. And then she put it online. And it became viral… that led to a book deal.</p> <p>The podcast was really popular. But I feel like you didn’t get the full story…</p> <p>Amy’s not just an author, therapist, social worker/mentally strong person. She’s also an entrepreneur.</p> <p>She was making money in her sleep...</p> <p>“I’ve always had some sort of a side hustle usually something fun or strange,” she said.</p> <p><br /> I knew immediately I needed to have her back on the show. I wanted her to  share this with my listeners. Because these are “choose yourself” ideas. Simple, easy to execute, and anyone can do it.  </p> <p><br /> “I had a friend who had a jewelry store,” Amy said, “so I knew the markup on jewelry was incredible, like 200 hundred or 300 hundred percent.”</p> <p>And she knew jewelry was fairly inexpensive to ship because it didn’t weigh anything. Over the years she and her husband thought about how they could turn this into something they could monetize. And finally they did it.</p> <p><br /> I asked so many questions about how she pulled the trigger. And got the courage. I wanted to know how she made this business work. I also gave her ideas about how she could scale.</p> <p>I really believe this: anyone who listens to this podcast can start doing their own side hustle right now.</p> <p><br /> “Over time it went from a few dollars to a few hundred and then before I knew it we were up to a few $1,000  dollars a month.”</p> <p>You could quit your job I told her.</p> <p>“That was the dream,” she said.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can read my show notes here:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/12/amy-morin-2/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/12/amy-morin-2/</a></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 288 - Mike Van Cleave: A Conversation About Cancer &amp; Learning How to Discard the Meaningless</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I got a call from my friend Mike Van Cleave a year ago. He told me had cancer. We hadn’t spoken for years.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It’s like mold in your refrigerator,” he said. “All of a sudden you’re like, ‘What the hell happened? It’s only been a week.”  </span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">You never know who’s going to call you out of the blue someday with cancer. It’s scary, but luckily we don’t live with these thoughts in our minds. We only think of ourselves. “Will I get cancer?” And that’s important. These selfish thoughts keep us alive.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve always admired my friend Mike. I felt honored to have him on this podcast. He told me the science of his cancer (thyroid cancer) and the ways he’s surviving every day.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ll take emotional pain over physical any day. So my bones can keep typing.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Do you have pain in your bones?” I asked him.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He did. And it went away. “I have no bone pain right now. So there’s a very good chance that all the bone metastasis is working,” he said.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">That takes away 80% of the “badness”. He spoke casually. And sometimes I laughed inappropriately.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I guess I was scared.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 18 months, his medicine will stop working. The cancer will keep growing again. And he’ll be on a new drug.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He told me about the success rate of his next drug (only 50% of people are helped and it only helps for 6 months).</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What’s the best case scenario?” I asked.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I cried afterwards. Not in front on him.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not there…</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">But later, when I was alone with my fear, I cried for hope. He’s down to his second to last drug. The second to last hope.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless they create a new medicine…</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re look at a maximum of three years,” I said… “What happens next?”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Honestly, really bad things happen,” he said.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then he told me, “All of a sudden there was meaning... The desire to connect with meaning overwhelmed the time I had for the meaningless. In some ways, you can’t understand it. And the one thing I’ve come to understand completely is there’s only one thing in your life that matters and that’s the quality of your relationships. It’s such a cliche. You can look back at thousands of quotes from people who are old and dying and they always talk about the people in their lives. Nobody cares how much money you have when you die.”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I stayed silent. I wanted to catch all his words. And learn from them.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Most of the things we sit around worrying about, you realize, at this stage, has no meaning. Now, it’s important. Maybe. Ya know, it’s important that I have a job, but the job itself only has the importance that you place in it.”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hope this podcast is a special moment for you like it was for me. I took it as a chance to step back from my life. And the problems I think about over and over again.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This interview allowed me to care for a friend. And I hope it lets you care for a stranger. That’s something I want to do a little bit more each day. Until the day is full with selfless thoughts between selfish thoughts.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maybe that’s part of the medicine.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to read the full show notes here:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/12/mike-van-cleave/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/12/mike-van-cleave/</a></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 287 - Scott Galloway: How the Four Most Influential Companies on the Planet Took Over the Market and Changed Humankind</title>
			<pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><br /> I don’t know where to begin. I’m a fan of Scott. I think he reminds me of someone I went to highschool with. He was bright and always cursing at the right time. I remember laughing. Because I felt close to being free. But he was the one with the ability to put himself in the middle of controversy.</p> <p>That’s something I (still) can’t do.</p> <p>He’d say eff this or eff that. Part of me felt compelled to egg him on. But he didn’t need it. He was comfortable being cynical and right.</p> <p>Scott Galloway does this with business. I watch his weekly  “Winners & Losers” videos where he tells you things like “Brands are dying” and “Amazon will be broken up” Then he’ll dress up like Spock and I’ll lose my mind.</p> <p>I get these videos emailed to my phone. And I’m also subscribed to his YouTube channel.</p> <p>He came on my podcast to talk about his new book, “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.”</p> <p>But we also talked about his past: creating and selling companies. Being on the board of The New York Times, wanting to salvage the newspaper industry (his idea back then was brilliant).</p> <p>“I got laughed out of the room,” he said.</p> <p>“What was your idea?”</p> <p><br /> “That the stupidest thing we did is buy into this bullshit lie that ‘information wants to be free.’”<br /> He’s right.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I don’t know where to begin. I’m a fan of Scott. I think he reminds me of someone I went to highschool with. He was bright and always cursing at the right time. I remember laughing. Because I felt close to being free. But he was the one with the ability to put himself in the middle of controversy.</p> <p>That’s something I (still) can’t do.</p> <p>He’d say eff this or eff that. Part of me felt compelled to egg him on. But he didn’t need it. He was comfortable being cynical and right.</p> <p>Scott Galloway does this with business. I watch his weekly  “Winners & Losers” videos where he tells you things like “Brands are dying” and “Amazon will be broken up” Then he’ll dress up like Spock and I’ll lose my mind.</p> <p>I get these videos emailed to my phone. And I’m also subscribed to his YouTube channel.</p> <p>He came on my podcast to talk about his new book, “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.”</p> <p>But we also talked about his past: creating and selling companies. Being on the board of The New York Times, wanting to salvage the newspaper industry (his idea back then was brilliant).</p> <p>“I got laughed out of the room,” he said.</p> <p>“What was your idea?”</p> <p> “That the stupidest thing we did is buy into this bullshit lie that ‘information wants to be free.’” He’s right. I remember the beginning on the internet. We gave information  away… And now they’re profiting off us. Scott called it “the hot girl effect”</p> <p>“Everybody wants to hang out with the hot girl,” he said. “So, to say you’re doing a deal with Google made you feel younger and more interesting.”</p> <p>They said “information wants to free.” So deals were made.</p> <p>He told me exactly how he would’ve turned it around.

And we laughed.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he’s right. He IS a super athlete. He evolved the art form. And went one level deeper than any opponent. He didn’t just say “how do I crush this person?” He said “How is the body working? What is this machine? How can I use it optimize my performance?”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I was studying the biomechanics,” Frank said. “And how to maximize it… everyone else studied technical fighting.”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he wasn’t always a fighter. He found the sport in jail.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was 11. He left home and learned “crime was a tool to change your situation and protect you,” Frank said.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">His parents were abusing him. “I was an emotional basket case,” he said. “I couldn’t hold anything together for more than a few days, no sport, no activities I would just fall apart.”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He escaped through crime. “ I actually threw rocks at a train and in California, that’s a felony.

They couldn’t believe what they were hearing.  </span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s when this small 11-year-old realized he had to get out.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">“When things didn’t work out, I knew what to do: commit a crime, go back to juvenile hall, see my friends…”</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cycle didn’t stop.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">He turned 17.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve become too comfortable. We’re innovating less and watching Netflix more.</p> <p>When I think of a “complacent class,” (a group of people who don’t care to move forward or move at all), I think of this: Americans soaking high wages off the backs of more aggressive global economies. I picture us eating delivered food, never moving, only using the remote. And having drones deliver everything we need.</p> <p>I had to ask Tyler Cowen about this. He’s a personal computer that’s going to answer all my economic questions.</p> <p>He knows all about the “complacent class.” Because he wrote the book on it.</p> <p>It’s called, “The Complacent Class: The Self-Defeating Quest for the American Dream”.</p> <p>“Look at it this way,” he said. “We’ve had these incredible advances in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We take fossil fuels and powerful machines and combine them to do everything you can imagine (cars, airplanes, electricity, radios, televisions). We’ve had incredible booms spread to the middle class. Spread to the poor. We’ve done that. Now we’re waiting for the next wave of big things.”</p> <p>I have an idea of what the next big wave could be… I’ve written about it before. And I’ve interviewed the experts. But I wanted to know, will we be successful?</p> <p>“We’re kind of running a race,” Tyler said. “Will the next wave of innovations and productivity come before our debts do us in? Right now to me, it’s looking like the answers no.”</p> <p>What Tyler said next scared me.</p> <p>“America is losing its dynamism.”</p> <p>But Tyler makes two distinctions here. The future is built on A) Innovation and B) PRODUCTIVITY. It’s the persistence to do.</p> <p>I still feel we’re trying to hit the frontier. We’re exploring space. Improving biotech. Creating countless innovations.</p> <p>But is this progress coming from is only the 1%? Are the rest of us just sitting around? Waiting for the benefits?</p> <p>I wanted to hear the worst case scenario. I don’t know why. Maybe sometimes fear pulls me in. It’s like following a narrow path of light in a dark cave. I'm not interested in the dark. I'm following the light.</p> <p>But what he said next is a scary thought to consider…</p> <p>“The worst case scenario is that America’s allies realize we cannot make good on all of our commitments. So they start fighting more amongst themselves. Trusting us less. Maybe building their own nuclear weapons. The fiscal position of the United States government becomes more and more cramped. We stop being credible. The quality of our governance continues to decline. And, both internationally and at home, we have a mess with warfare and partial collapse of international order. And here we have a return of something like the 1970s with high unemployment, high inflation and stagflation,” Tyler says.</p> <p>So then what is our future? What can we depend on?</p> <p>In this podcast, I ask Tyler and he shows me how we can create a dynamic future… How we can keep reaching for the frontier.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!

Nobody's normal. We’re so full of stuff and trauma and nonsense and silly beliefs.

It turned out that she had watched her father beat her mother into unconsciousness on multiple occasions… knocked out, unconscious, on the floor. And that was just the tip of the iceberg.”</p> <p>She’s acting in response to her past. Not her present. I think that’s what Tim means when he said, “we're cause and effect collection machines.”</p> <p>And that’s really where advice comes from… the intersection between cause, effect, and hindsight.</p> <p>I feel Tim’s really mastered this new intersection. He’s embracing being “a work in progress.”</p> <p>That’s what makes his new book so relatable.</p> <p><br /> It’s called “Tribe of Mentors: Short Life Advice from the Best in the World.”</p> <p>He reached out to Matt Ridley, Stephen Pressfield, Dustin Moskovitz, Naval Ravikant, Patton Oswalt, Susan Cain, Ben Stiller, Annie Duke… the list goes on and on.</p> <p>(But don’t worry!

And make it beautiful, creative, and inspiring. He titled it, “The Center Will Not Hold”.</p> <p>This podcast is about so many things. Joan Didion’s writing. Griffin Dunne’s career.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s Scott’s 3rd time on the podcast. In the first interview, he was “the creator of Dilbert.” A famous cartoonist. The second time he was still “the creator of Dilbert” and a hypnosis/persuasion student. Now (appearance #3), Scott Adams is something new. He’s reinvented. And no longer standing on the footbridge between old self and new self. He’s the author of “Win Bigly: Persuasion in a World Where Facts Don't Matter” and infamous for predicting Trump’s win… two years before election day.</p> <p>His prediction was spot on.</p> <p>Before Trump raced Hillary. Before he beat Ted Cruz in the primaries. And before he beat 18 other "more experienced" Republican candidates (Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ben Carson, and the ones who’s names I can’t remember.)</p> <p>Scott could name each persuasion trick Trump was using. His tone, the stories he told, the way he made you remember him, his thoughts, plans, policies, tweets. And how he's still doing it to us today.</p> <p>I wanted to know how he knew. But I also wanted to know how he changes his career. And his life.</p> <p>“I came in through the side entrance,” he said.</p> <p>“Why?”</p> <p>““Look how hard it is to change to fields. And so so dramatically. The hardest sell is convincing someone you’re not what you’ve been for decades… Or convincing them that you have more to offer,” he said.</p> <p>“Right.” And then I realized we hadn’t even talked about cartooning. And the interview was almost done.</p> <p>He taught me the most important rule for persuading anyone of anything: facts don’t matter.</p> <p>“What makes news and what makes people care is if you do something in a different way,” he said. New doesn’t matter. New and different matters.</p> <p>“In this case, I’m talking about politics, but I'm talking about persuasion. That was a different way. That immediately gets people’s attention. And they say, ‘Oh a new thing. Finally, there’s a new thing. Let’s talk about the new thing.”</p> <p>In this episode, Scott teaches you that it’s possible change someone's perspective of you. That you can break free of the titles and jobs you hold and become who you really feel you are.</p> <p>He’ll walk you through how he did it… how President Trump did it, and how you can do it, too.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>He was trying out a role built for him. The screenwriter wrote the script with John in mind. He wrote his name in the margin. "A John McGinley type."</p> <p>"Did that give you high confidence?" I asked him.</p> <p>"No, they made me audition 5 times for a John McGinley type!”</p> <p>So I wanted to know how he landed so many incredible roles. He told me the secret. We either poison ourselves. Or we thrive.</p> <p>It's our choice. We make it every day. And usually one is our habit.</p> <p>“Actors usually bring one of two things with them into a room," he said.</p> <p>"They usually either bring in 'pigpen,' which is this cloud of dust." He gave me an example: You walk into an audition or an interview. You say, ‘My aunt died in Philadelphia last night so I had to take the train down there and I never got a chance to look at your script/proposal/offer.” <br />  That's pigpen. And you’re out before you gave anyone the chance to give you a chance.  </p> <p><br /> I asked John why people do that. Why do we pick poison? </p> <p><br /> “Fear. We’re afraid. We’re afraid of our own shadows. Sometimes we come in and we impose our problems into the room. And that’s pigpen. And you’re dead."</p> <p>And it happens in every situation in life really. You can probably think of a friend who does this to themselves all the time.</p> <p>So what's the other choice?</p> <p>Elvis dust.</p> <p>“Elvis dust is when you come in with this strange combination of self-esteem meets homework meets right for the part meets the room. And when people bring in Elvis dust all we wanna do is get it on us."</p> <p>Al Pacino had Elvis Dust. So did Paul Newman. John worked with both of them.  <br /> “What would you see in Al Pacino’s acting that was really above and beyond? What did you learn from him?” I asked. </p> <p><br /> “He’s a magician," John asked him why he wanted to be an actor in the first place. Al Pacino said, “Johnny, see, I just want to be a storyteller.’"</p> <p>I asked John what he wanted to be growing up... his answer was the same as Al's.</p> <p>"I didn’t know what it would look like.

"A John McGinley type."</p> <p>"Did that give you high confidence?" I asked him.</p> <p>"No, they made me audition 5 times for a John McGinley type!”</p> <p>So I wanted to know how he landed so many incredible roles. He told me the secret. We either poison ourselves. Or we thrive.</p> <p>It's our choice. We make it every day. And usually one is our habit.</p> <p>“Actors usually bring one of two things with them into a room," he said.</p> <p>"They usually either bring in 'pigpen,' which is this cloud of dust." He gave me an example: You walk into an audition or an interview. You say, ‘My aunt died in Philadelphia last night so I had to take the train down there and I never got a chance to look at your script/proposal/offer.”   That's pigpen. And you’re out before you gave anyone the chance to give you a chance.  </p> <p> I asked John why people do that. Why do we pick poison? </p> <p> “Fear. We’re afraid. We’re afraid of our own shadows. Sometimes we come in and we impose our problems into the room. And that’s pigpen. And you’re dead."</p> <p>And it happens in every situation in life really. You can probably think of a friend who does this to themselves all the time.</p> <p>So what's the other choice?</p> <p>Elvis dust.</p> <p>“Elvis dust is when you come in with this strange combination of self-esteem meets homework meets right for the part meets the room. And when people bring in Elvis dust all we wanna do is get it on us."</p> <p>Al Pacino had Elvis Dust. So did Paul Newman. John worked with both of them.   “What would you see in Al Pacino’s acting that was really above and beyond? What did you learn from him?” I asked. </p> <p> “He’s a magician," John asked him why he wanted to be an actor in the first place. Al Pacino said, “Johnny, see, I just want to be a storyteller.’"</p> <p>I asked John what he wanted to be growing up... his answer was the same as Al's.</p> <p>"I didn’t know what it would look like. But I knew I loved participating in any kind of storytelling process."</p> <p>Maybe that's what Elvis Dust is made of...  </p> <p>You can read my show notes here:</p> <p><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/11/john-c-mcginley/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/11/john-c-mcginley/</a></p> <p>And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</p>]]></content:encoded>

She's a 26 Academy Award winning HBO producer. She birthed the modern documentary. 1,700 of them in total.</p> <p>"I think everyone has something to offer," Sheila said.</p> <p>But not everyone realizes it. "Sometimes you're so embittered by life that you never can tell your story," she said. “I think in the best of all worlds everybody would respect their own story. They would feel that their life was worthy... that they had done the best they could... that they were the victim either of circumstance or the recipient of good luck."</p> <p>She sees people as picture. To Sheila, all life is either film uncaptured or captured.</p> <p>"I walked home last night," she said. "There were a lot of bag people out. Madison Avenue... pretty ritzy block. Fancy stores and a guy collecting cans. No one who threw that can in that garbage thought that someone could get five cents for it."</p> <p>Sheila made documentaries.

			<title>Ep. 272 - Lewis Howes: "The Masks of Masculinity": Why Men Wear Masks and How to Remove them to Live Your Best Life</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Was Lewis Howes a bully? Is it possible? He set up the situation:</p> <p>When you’re young, you’re told to be kind, open, loving, helpful and generous. When you stand up to the bullies for treating someone badly, what happens? They shove you in a locker.</p> <p>Your mindset changes.</p> <p>And then you realize… maybe it doesn’t feel good to be open, kind and generous.</p> <p>So we put on these masks.</p> <p>We try to fit in. We try to protect ourselves.</p> <p>Lewis walked me through the masks:</p> <p>The athletic mask<br /> The material mask<br /> The sexual mask<br /> The know it all mask (and so on.)</p> <p>He writes about each one in his new book, “The Mask of Masculinity: How Men Can Embrace Vulnerability, Create Strong Relationships, and Live Their Fullest Lives.”</p> <p>And he gives a real-life example for each mask. I’m in the book. He put me in as the example for the “know it all mask.”</p> <p>So I asked him, “Why did include me in your book?”</p> <p>“Well, as I was writing it, I was trying to think of examples of men in my life who are a good representation of these masks," he said. "For example, the sexual mask was Tucker Max and Neil Strauss. For the material mask, I talk about Ty Lopez. I’m not trying to make any man wrong," he said. “They're just examples of men who have lead with these masks and got amazing results but also struggled."</p> <p> </p> <p>But I was still curious why he included me. I push. "I think to me, you’re just a brilliant guy who always knew how to build up businesses. You had the answers, you were smart in chess. You read a ton of books. You just had a lot of information," he said.</p> <p>But he also reveals my failures. And how I exposed myself through writing. I put my fear and the stories behind my fear out in the open. And that's what Lewis calls "the vulnerability hiding beneath the mask." </p> <p>It's what we lost when we were shoved in the locker, humiliated and afraid. We have to return to what was once lost.</p> <p>But be careful not to put a new mask on at the same time.</p> <p>I made this mistake. And I think I still make it. After losing everything and writing about it, I put on a new mask. “I think that became an addiction for me,” I told Lewis. I replaced the “know it all mask” or the “Wall Street” mask with a new, “self-deprecating mask.”</p> <p>I felt if I didn’t write a new self-deprecating story about myself every day, I’d disappear.</p> <p>And it goes back to Lewis’s point. Masks help us protect ourselves. But they also help us lose our sense of self.</p> <p>“Most of us don’t feel like people will still like us or love us if we’re not producing one of these masks…” he said.</p> <p>It’s scary to remove the protected mask layer. But Lewis says that’s part of growing into your true self.</p> <p>“Try to think, ‘How can I take off the masks that aren’t supporting my vision or the masks that are maybe hurting other people in the process?’”</p> <p>I’ve known Lewis a long time. And I wanted to learn from his new strengths. Not just the ones he’s mastered. I wanted to learn from the lessons he’s still trying to learn.</p> <p>So I asked him, “What if this book doesn’t do well? And you get the worst reviews?” Because he said winning was one of his old masks.</p> <p>“Here’s the thing, I’ve come to peace with it,” Lewis said. “I’ve thought about this. ‘If I didn’t get on the bestseller list how would I feel?’ My ego would be hurt. I’d be sad and frustrated because I worked so hard. But I’m focused on the vision, the process, and the message more than the result. I’m not defining my self-worth based on the result anymore. If I don’t hit the ‘New York Times’ list, it’s okay. It’s more important for me to get the message out than to get the result.”</p> <p>I believe in Lewis's message, too. It's helpful for men to understand themselves and for women to understand the men in their lives.</p> <p>Enjoy.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[President Obama] knew who I was, but he knew who a lot of people were,” David Litt, a former speechwriter for the president, told me in this podcast.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrote speeches for the president. Now he writes for “Funny or Die”. And before the White House, David wrote for “The Onion”. His style is satirical, humorous and self-deprecating. When Obama made you laugh, there’s a chance it was really David Litt.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked him, “What’s the funniest thing you wrote that you were happy the president said?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh man, it doesn’t sound that funny when I say it, but, it got at a truth about politics that we probably could have expressed otherwise,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The joke was told at the 2013 Correspondents dinner. Obama said, ‘I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humor helps us tell the truth. And it helps us remember the truth. And sometimes it just gives us a break from the chaos.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the time Reagan needed surgery after getting shot. He said to the surgeon, “I hope you’re a Republican.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And everyone remembers that.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t have to be the president’s right-hand man or woman to contribute to your country,” David said. “I mean, you certainly can be and those are important stories, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but I wanted to write a book about this other side of public service.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I wondered, could I do it? Could I write for a president?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how did he transition from “The Onion” to the Oval?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In America, your place in history isn’t determined for you,” David said. It’s not determined by where you’re born or who your parents are. “You make your own place in history as an American.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Obama first became a senator, a reporter asked him, "What will be your mark in history?" The young Barack Obama laughed and said, "I haven't even sat at my desk yet."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he repeated this story at a commencement speech in 2005. (I'm paraphrasing.) But he told the students, "You haven't sat at your desk yet… but you still have a choice."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered how he did that… how he connected this small part of his personal history to this larger idea of making your mark.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s called the ladder of meaning,” David told me. “I forget who coined the phrase, but at the bottom of the ladder are basic details and at the top of the ladder are big values.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of my favorite speeches is the speech Martin Luther King delivered the night before he was shot. He talks about surviving an assassination attempt. A deranged woman, stabbed him with a letter opener.</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">It almost got to his heart. Doctors told him that if he sneezed, he would die.</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">This got out in the press and he got a letter from a nine year old, white girl who said, ‘I just wanted to let you know I’m glad you didn’t sneeze.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Martin Luther King gives his speech about the progress of civil rights. “He prefaces everything with saying, ‘I too am glad I didn’t sneeze because If I had sneezed I wouldn’t have been able to tell you all about a dream that I had.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s connecting this very meaningless moment (a sneeze) with these incredibly important national events.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was beautiful. He used imagery. “I’ve been to the mountain top.” He used passion and love. He used the top of the ladder and the bottom.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This episode isn’t about politics. It’s about how words make history. And with every new word, you can make your own history, too.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for reading!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sir Richard Branson. End of notes. Enjoy.</p> <p>Just kidding.</p> <p>The advice from Richard is priceless. He's a self-made billionaire (BILLION!) who windsurfed across the English Channel with his kids, biked from Northern Italy to Southern italy with his whole family (they rode 100 miles a day). He's active everyday. Active in life, active in fatherhood, active in business.</p> <p>“My slogan is 'Screw it, just do it.' Why not just try these things? You may fall flat on your face," he said, "but you’ll have fun."</p> <p>That's part of "find your virginity." (The slogan based on his new book "Finding My Virginity: The New Autobiography")</p> <p>Then he told me how he applies this to Virgin, the multi-billion dollar empire he started on a whim...</p> <p>“A business is simply coming up with an idea that’s going to make people’s lives better," he said. That's why he's been in business for over 50 years. "If I hadn’t reinvented myself I wouldn’t be in business,” he said. "And if I see a situation where people’s lives are not as good as they could be, we’ll jump in. We'll try to improve people’s lives."</p> <p>I don't have an easy time saying "screw it." I usually overthink. And second guess myself. I want to change that. So I called Richard. And he told me how to change... he told me how to find my virginity.</p> <p>Make sure to read the full show notes here:</p> <p><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/sir-richard-branson/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/sir-richard-branson/</a></p> <p>And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I've never been a vampire. But Kellan has. He got his big break in "Twilight." This was an epic. Five movies back to back. It was a supernatural role in this made up fantasy world. And that's where he found his freedom.</p> <p><br /> "With Sci-Fi, you have this freedom to create whatever world, whatever rules, you want. There’s nothing tell you what you can and cannot do," he said. "We’re playing these vampires that don’t breathe, don’t eat, so trying to portray human qualities was interesting."<br /> But now he's done with that series. He's taking on more challenging characters. And contributing his fame to charities he cares about deeply.</p> <p>He came to New York to support the Geoffrey Beene Foundation. (He's the brand ambassador for them). They had an event in New York, "Frame This Revelation." It's aimed "to uncovers the truth of cancer's ruthless and vicious assault by showcasing the work of artists who are battling this insidious disease – either for themselves or their loved ones." The campaign is raising awareness for new cancer research. And I felt lucky to learn about it directly from Kellan. </p> <p>"Children and animals just always get my heart beating. And when my good friend, Kim Biddle, created "Save the Innocence" an organization that deals with children being trafficked for sex out in LA..."</p> <p><br /> I had to interject. Because I'm totally naive.</p> <p><br />  “How big is this problem? Because on a day to day basis, you hear the words "sex trafficking," but you never see it." He told me about the problem. He told me how it's all around us in everyday life. And how we miss the signs. Because we're not educated.</p> <p>"When you’re educated, you see it first hand," he said. He told me how hard it is for girls to escape. And why they get trapped repeatedly.</p> <p><br /> And he told me the solution to... building a case, getting law enforcement involved... "A lot of times, women don’t feel worthy... we have to give them hope," he said. And so I listened and I learned how we can give hope.</p> <p> </p> <p>You can learn more about the Geoffrey Been Foundation at <a href= "http://www.geoffreybeene.com">www.geoffreybeene.com</a></p> <p>You can read my show notes here:</p> <p><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/kellan-lutz/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/kellan-lutz/</a></p> <p>And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The FBI went to his high school when the 15-year-old Mr. X hacked into the largest Internet company in the world and stole 90 million credit card numbers. <br /> <br /> "You are going to jail for a long time," they told him. <br /> <br /> The day after he stole them he sent them back to the company and explained what their cybersecurity flaws were. <br /> <br /> He thought they would thank him. <br /> <br /> The FBI came to arrest him. "I was scared to death," he told me when we first met. <br /> <br /> The head of the school, a three-star general, told them, "You guys better get out of here if you aren't writing this boy a check and saying thank you." <br /> <br /> They left. <br /> <br /> Then. <br /> <br /> Two years later when Mr. X graduated he got "the call". The call that meant he wouldn't go to college. <br /> <br /> The call that meant he would parachute into enemy fire, hack foreign governments, hack our own computers. "I've done so many things," he once told me. "You can't imagine." <br /> <br /> The call from a three initial agency. More than one. <br /> <br /> We met at a dinner. We were both obsessed with hacking and the latest flaws in computer security. We ignored every else and spoke for three hours. <br /> <br /> And we haven't stopped talking since. <br /> <br /> I don't mean this to be a conspiracy theory. There's already been rumors about "fake news", election hacking, etc. <br /> <br /> There are bot armies. There are hackers taking down electric grids every day. Every company in the Fortune 500 is completely hacked. Your computer is hacked. <br /> <br /> I've spent many years talking to people in the security space. <br /> <br /> The reality is: the war is on. <br /> <br /> And it's being fought with data. And it's being fought all over the world. And it's being fought every day. <br /> <br /> Not just on election systems. Or at big companies. But on your computer. And the war is not always being fought by the people you expect. The enemies we were always trained to believe. <br /> <br /> Mr. X spent time in special forces. Was in every overseas battle. Has been involved in more news stories than he likes to admit. <br /> <br /> He's also built and sold two companies using his hacking abilities. He lives a good life now and doesn't want his voice e or identity to be revealed.<br /> <br /> So we distorted it for the podcast. <br /> <br /> I asked him, "Do you still work for 'them' ". <br /> <br /> He turned away and said, "You never stop working for them." <br /> <br /> The goal of this isn't to scare people. Information is power. <br /> <br /> And this is some of what I've learned from Mr. X. <br /> <br /> 1. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A VOICE, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK<br /> <br /> “In the past, to go up against an institution, you need to be an institution.” Mr. X said. “Now more than ever, we need to stand up for what we believe in. We have these powerful, engaging tools to influence others, but we still leave it up to the powers that control us to influence us.<br /> <br /> If you believe something, share it.<br /> <br /> In other words, don't let the media "program" what you believe in. Don't let the online word "hack" into your brain. They already know more about you than you know about yourself. And they use that knowledge against you 24 hours a day. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a voice, YOU HAVE TO SPEAK.<br /> <br /> 2. POLICE YOURSELF<br /> <br /> We were talking about computer security. He told me all the ways you could be hacked… that you would never think of. <br /> <br /> “Let me ask yo, when’s the last time you updated your firmware on your router?” <br /> <br /> I had no idea.<br /> <br /> “If I'm going in, I'm going through the router,” he said. “The majority of the fortune 500 use the same router… So you either trust the government to police data OR you need to be that person.”<br /> <br /> And that was just one weakness. Next time you are on your phone check out how many apps on your phone have permission to turn on your video camera and start recording and transmitting what they record without you being aware. <br /> <br /> Don't think they aren't doing it. <br /> <br /> 3. HOW DID OSAMA BIN LADEN REALLY DIE?<br /> <br /> Was Osama Bin Laden really casually sleeping on the third floor of a building with no access out? Or was he a prisoner and we had lost our use for him? <br /> <br /> Mr. X: "he was our prisoner for years. Then we had no use for him." <br /> <br /> Always question everything the media and the government tells us. Always be a skeptic in a world where it's not in anyone's benefit to tell you the truth. <br /> <br /> This is not conspiracy theory. The only truth is to trust the people you love. The people who love you. <br /> <br /> This doesn't mean be irrational or paranoid or come up with crazy theories. <br /> <br /> This means practice being a skeptic every day on every issue. <br /> <br /> Practice skepticism. Not paranoia. <br /> <br /> 4. BE VULNERABLE TO GETTING SHUT DOWN<br /> <br /> I knew there were millions of questions I wanted to ask… but couldn’t.<br /> <br /> I asked anyway.<br /> <br /> “Are you still involved in the government?” <br /> <br /> “I can’t say that,” he said.<br /> <br /> “Well, which agency were you in?”<br /> <br /> “I can’t say.”<br /> <br /> “Do people know it?”<br /> <br /> “Yes, let’s just say it’s a well-known 3 letter agency.”<br /> <br /> Ask. Get shut down. Ask again.<br /> <br /> When I do an interview, I don't want to harass people for an answer. But sometimes if you poke and prod from various directions while you build rapport, you can get the answer. <br /> <br /> Not this time. <br /> <br /> 5. KNOW WHAT DRIVES YOU<br /> <br /> Mr. X started hacking when he was in military school. <br /> <br /> Everything was regimented: <br /> wake up<br /> first mess<br /> solute the flag<br /> go to class<br /> second mess<br /> second class<br /> change 15 minutes<br /> go to sports<br /> third mess<br /> after third mess, 2 hours of study hall, one hour of free time<br /> go to sleep<br /> do it all over again<br /> <br /> The school is isolated. And the students can’t leave campus. <br /> <br /> The only way Mr. X could talk to girls was if he found them online. “We were heavily confined,” he said.<br /> <br /> But he kept hitting firewalls.<br /> <br /> So he started hacking. He learned everything he could. Not because he wanted to "attack" websites. But because he didn't want to be alone. <br /> <br /> Always let the prison walls around you create your opportunities. <br /> <br /> Censorship created his curiosity. <br /> <br /> What frustrates you that can kickstart your curiosity. <br /> <br /> 6. LEARN YOUR PATTERNS<br /> <br /> Mr. X helped find one of the most well known serial killers in recent years and put him behind bars for life. <br /> <br /> Mr. X was paid to find patterns. He watched terrorists. The example: “a burn phone.” This is what criminals use to cover their call history. They buy a cheap phone. Call a few people, throw it away and buy a new one. <br /> <br /> So Mr. X wrote software. <br /> <br /> Someone calls you, then you call 3-4 people. Those 3-4 people call 3-4 more people. It’s a tree of calling. And if they follow the branches then can find the roots.<br /> <br /> He analyzed the trees of one billion phone calls a day. He had access to all of our calls. <br /> <br /> “Eventually, you realize that if a bunch of random numbers keep calling the same person that all those random numbers are the same guy,” Mr. X said. <br /> <br /> People are patterns. Those patterns become your fingerprint. <br /> <br /> He used that fingerprint to identify a notorious serial killer. Used GPS to track him down. Now the guy is in jail. <br /> <br /> He used those fingerprints to track terrorists. "There were a lot of attacks stopped."<br /> <br /> 7. INTERESTS PRECEDE EDUCATION<br /> <br /> He wasn't educated about hacking or even computers. But he was passionate about it and learned everything he could. <br /> <br /> “I found something I was interested in… and that was the best education I ever received.” <br /> <br /> Find an interest. List every day the things you were interested in as a kid. It's never too late to learn now. <br /> <br /> The one who loves what he does will always learn faster and better than the person who doesn't love it. <br /> <br /> The one in love will compete better against the one who doesn't. <br /> <br /> The one in love will be...happier. <br /> <br /> 8. TRUST THE INVISIBLE<br /> <br /> “You were saving lives,” I said. <br /> <br /> “No, I wouldn’t say that.” <br /> <br /> But I insisted. Because I feel we all have invisible threads of impact. We help and hurt people in ways we don’t know. <br /> <br /> We all have our special abilities. And abilities to help and hurt without realizing. Always be healthy enough to know the difference. <br /> <br /> Mr. X got married. Loves his family. Loves his work. "Some of my ex partners never escaped the mindset wer were programmed with."<br /> <br /> Reach for the positive when trapped in a negative.<br /> <br /> Love someone. <br /> <br /> 9. CHOOSE YOUR OWN NETWORTH<br /> <br /> Mr. X measures his net worth not by dollars, not by accomplishments or promotions. “My net worth is now in data," he said.<br /> <br /> He comes from hacker culture where the core belief is that information should be free. <br /> <br /> Too often, we accept what's been given to us. "The rules" we were told to live by. The standards were set for us...<br /> <br /> But Mr. X proved you can set your own standards. You can choose the measurement of your net worth. Rich in relationships, rich in people, rich in joy, rich in knowledge...<br /> <br /> 10. LEARN EVERYTHING YOU CAN<br /> <br /> Mr. X found a pattern in his own life. He realized he loved hacking. And he loved detecting patterns. He got the same joy from both. <br /> <br /> So he started reading books… and learned everything he could about computers, code, internet, backdoors and so on. <br /> <br /> He used those abilities to fight wars. Then to help law enforcement track down criminals. And then to build massive companies that he sold. <br /> <br /> I met Mr. X with his wife and daughters recently. I had never seen him so happy. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the best pattern is the smile of your daughter. At least I think so.</p> <p>You can read my show notes here:</p> <p><a href= "https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/mr-x/">https://jamesaltucher.com/2017/10/mr-x/</a></p> <p>And don't forget to subscribe to "The James Altucher Show" on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcasts!</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Comedy is brutal. If the audience doesn't know you, they WILL judge you. That's true for most things (you can't walk down the sidewalk in New York City without being judged at least a hundred times).</p> <p><br /> Bonnie said you have to know your audience. I wondered "how though?" I gave an example, "Okay so do you try to figure out how old the audience is, what gender they are, sexual orientation, race, how much they drank or didn't drink, etc.?"</p> <p><br /> "No, I usually just think, 'Okay, blue collar, I'll do my marriage stuff."</p> <p><br /> It was that easy. That's professionalism. That's professional judgement. That's comedy. And the path to likability.</p> <p><br /> Bonnie has a joke about using the GPS.</p> <p><br /> "In Brooklyn I'm not going to do driving material. I have a really funny GPS joke that I can't do in the city because nobody drives. "I'm so immature about it," she said. She makes fun of the audience... They didn't ALWAYS live in the city. "Sometimes it irritates me. I'm like I know you understand what GPS is, if you saw this in a movie you'd get it, so don't just sit there like 'oh not my experience'."</p> <p><br /> I learned you can lose likability as quickly as you gain it, though. And that scared me. But Bonnie doesn't care. "I like when the audience is scared for you. If they don't laugh at something I think is funny, I lash out. Sometimes we start in a love fest, then I insult them and them maybe we still end in a love fest."</p> <p><br /> Her process is her art. She has hundred of jokes. "The premises just come," she said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comedy is brutal. If the audience doesn't know you, they WILL judge you. That's true for most things (you can't walk down the sidewalk in New York City without being judged at least a hundred times).</p> <p> Bonnie said you have to know your audience. I wondered "how though?" I gave an example, "Okay so do you try to figure out how old the audience is, what gender they are, sexual orientation, race, how much they drank or didn't drink, etc.?"</p> <p> "No, I usually just think, 'Okay, blue collar, I'll do my marriage stuff."</p> <p> It was that easy. That's professionalism. That's professional judgement. That's comedy. And the path to likability.</p> <p> Bonnie has a joke about using the GPS.</p> <p> "In Brooklyn I'm not going to do driving material. I have a really funny GPS joke that I can't do in the city because nobody drives. "I'm so immature about it," she said. She makes fun of the audience... They didn't ALWAYS live in the city. "Sometimes it irritates me. I'm like I know you understand what GPS is, if you saw this in a movie you'd get it, so don't just sit there like 'oh not my experience'."</p> <p> I learned you can lose likability as quickly as you gain it, though. And that scared me. But Bonnie doesn't care. "I like when the audience is scared for you. If they don't laugh at something I think is funny, I lash out. Sometimes we start in a love fest, then I insult them and them maybe we still end in a love fest."</p> <p> Her process is her art. She has hundred of jokes. "The premises just come," she said. She takes from life. The premises are there all the time," she said. "I just write whatever happens to be in front of me." Right now she's working on a joke: "what if your therapist was a Syrian refugee?"</p> <p> I think I did more laughing than questioning in this interview.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span class="il">AJ</span>’s about to launch a TV show. A few months ago he started a podcast. He’s 49 years old.

How do you do that? </p> <p>"Read books you don’t think are interesting," he said. Explore new podcasts, watch old movies. Then observe yourself.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Life is tough…and it’s also miraculous.”</p> <p>T-Boz and TLC sold 70 million albums, becoming the bestselling girl band ever in America.</p> <p>Along the way they declared bankruptcy, she battled sickle-cell anemia, the death of one of their bandmates and best friends, a brain tumor, everything.</p> <p>She’s 47 today and beat two life sentences the doctors declared on her.</p> <p>People say, “Well, she sold 70 million albums! That’s success!”</p> <p>When you do your absolute best today, even though you know tomorrow everything can change – that’s success.</p> <p>I had T-Boz on the podcast to celebrate the release of her new memoir, “A Sick Life” which I highly recommend.</p> <p>REINVENTION IS EVERY DAY</p> <p>TLC sold 70 million albums and is the #1 selling girl band in America.</p> <p>But to stay creative, T-Boz and her bandmates, Left-eye, and Chili had to constantly develop music that stayed fresh and relevant. 15 years after they started, they released their 5th album</p> <p>REMEMBERING THE ABOVE</p> <p>I always say “Reinvention is every day” ever since my book, “Reinvent Yourself” came out.</p> <p>But I’ll be honest, just as hard is remembering every day that “reinvention every day”.</p> <p>The straight and narrow and supposedly easy path is constantly whispering to me to follow it.</p> <p>But don’t.</p> <p>IDEA SEX</p> <p>Other groups were R&B, other groups were rap, other groups were funk.</p> <p>How do you be the best?</p> <p>T-Boz (funk) + Left-Eye (Rap) + Chili (R&B) = TLC = 70 million albums</p> <p>PERSISTENCE</p> <p>Sickle-cell anemia is debilitating. You’re not supposed to live. The blood cells don’t want to deliver oxygen to the rest of your body. The pain is incredible.</p> <p>T-Boz’s brain tumor took three years to recover from. The death of her best friend and band-mate took 2 years to recover from.</p> <p>Going bankrupt after selling tens of millions of albums forced her to start from scratch.</p> <p>Reinventing in a constantly changing music business is the downfall of many artists. For their last album, TLC even used Kickstarted to fund it as opposed to a record label.</p> <p>Success is about reinvention and persistent every day.</p> <p>IF YOU’RE AN ARTIST, KNOW THE BUSINESS</p> <p>A lot of creatives don’t want to read the contracts or fine print. TLC didn’t read it as well and ended up making almost no money on their first 30 million albums.</p> <p>At one point they even held up music legend, Clive Davis, at gun point, asking, “Where’s our money”.</p> <p>They went bankrupt and had to start from scratch.</p> <p>Don’t outsource your financial well-being and the security of your family to others.</p> <p>SICKNESS AND PAIN</p> <p>No matter who you are, life is going to happen. “Life is tough”. T-Boz had painful sickle-cell anemia since birth and often had to be hospitalized mid-album, mid-tour, mid-whatever.</p> <p>“When I was seven they told me I wouldn’t live past 30. I’m 47 now.”</p> <p>“They told me I couldn’t have kids. I have two now.”</p> <p>“When they did brain surgery, they told me I might never sing again. I’m on tour now with our latest album.”</p> <p>Then she lost her best friend and band-mate, Left-eye, to a car crash. She was depressed for two years.</p> <p>Then she had a brain tumor that required surgery and three years of physical therapy to recover from.</p> <p>“I still can’t whistle,” she told me.</p> <p>“Try,” I said. So she did. She couldn’t whistle. “I can’t move the muscles on the left side of my mouth.”</p> <p>But throughout the podcast she laughed. “And I’m going back on tour tomorrow.”</p> <p>CREATIVITY HAS MANY OUTLETS</p> <p>T-Boz has written songs, performed them, did the choreography for TLC’s videos, conceived of the videos, written a book of poems, written movies, and now this memoir.</p> <p>People sometimes say, “I can’t be creative”. Or, “I don’t have the talent”. Or “I can do X, but not Y”.</p> <p>Not true. Creativity is a muscle. Find some small way to be creative every day and the muscle gets developed. For me, today is the first day I’m going to try to do standup in the same day at two different clubs. I’m scared.</p> <p>Find one thing scary and challenging and creative every day.</p> <p>What happens then? Everything.</p> <p>SAY WHAT YOU MEAN</p> <p>A lot of pop music today is created by people who have reverse engineered “the hit”.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Life is tough…and it’s also miraculous.”</p> <p>T-Boz and TLC sold 70 million albums, becoming the bestselling girl band ever in America.</p> <p>Along the way they declared bankruptcy, she battled sickle-cell anemia, the death of one of their bandmates and best friends, a brain tumor, everything.</p> <p>She’s 47 today and beat two life sentences the doctors declared on her.</p> <p>People say, “Well, she sold 70 million albums! That’s success!”</p> <p>When you do your absolute best today, even though you know tomorrow everything can change – that’s success.</p> <p>I had T-Boz on the podcast to celebrate the release of her new memoir, “A Sick Life” which I highly recommend.</p> <p>REINVENTION IS EVERY DAY</p> <p>TLC sold 70 million albums and is the #1 selling girl band in America.</p> <p>But to stay creative, T-Boz and her bandmates, Left-eye, and Chili had to constantly develop music that stayed fresh and relevant. 15 years after they started, they released their 5th album</p> <p>REMEMBERING THE ABOVE</p> <p>I always say “Reinvention is every day” ever since my book, “Reinvent Yourself” came out.</p> <p>But I’ll be honest, just as hard is remembering every day that “reinvention every day”.</p> <p>The straight and narrow and supposedly easy path is constantly whispering to me to follow it.</p> <p>But don’t.</p> <p>IDEA SEX</p> <p>Other groups were R&B, other groups were rap, other groups were funk.</p> <p>How do you be the best?</p> <p>T-Boz (funk) + Left-Eye (Rap) + Chili (R&B) = TLC = 70 million albums</p> <p>PERSISTENCE</p> <p>Sickle-cell anemia is debilitating. You’re not supposed to live. The blood cells don’t want to deliver oxygen to the rest of your body. The pain is incredible.</p> <p>T-Boz’s brain tumor took three years to recover from. The death of her best friend and band-mate took 2 years to recover from.</p> <p>Going bankrupt after selling tens of millions of albums forced her to start from scratch.</p> <p>Reinventing in a constantly changing music business is the downfall of many artists. For their last album, TLC even used Kickstarted to fund it as opposed to a record label.</p> <p>Success is about reinvention and persistent every day.</p> <p>IF YOU’RE AN ARTIST, KNOW THE BUSINESS</p> <p>A lot of creatives don’t want to read the contracts or fine print. TLC didn’t read it as well and ended up making almost no money on their first 30 million albums.</p> <p>At one point they even held up music legend, Clive Davis, at gun point, asking, “Where’s our money”.</p> <p>They went bankrupt and had to start from scratch.</p> <p>Don’t outsource your financial well-being and the security of your family to others.</p> <p>SICKNESS AND PAIN</p> <p>No matter who you are, life is going to happen. “Life is tough”. T-Boz had painful sickle-cell anemia since birth and often had to be hospitalized mid-album, mid-tour, mid-whatever.</p> <p>“When I was seven they told me I wouldn’t live past 30. I’m 47 now.”</p> <p>“They told me I couldn’t have kids. I have two now.”</p> <p>“When they did brain surgery, they told me I might never sing again. I’m on tour now with our latest album.”</p> <p>Then she lost her best friend and band-mate, Left-eye, to a car crash. She was depressed for two years.</p> <p>Then she had a brain tumor that required surgery and three years of physical therapy to recover from.</p> <p>“I still can’t whistle,” she told me.</p> <p>“Try,” I said. So she did. She couldn’t whistle. “I can’t move the muscles on the left side of my mouth.”</p> <p>But throughout the podcast she laughed. “And I’m going back on tour tomorrow.”</p> <p>CREATIVITY HAS MANY OUTLETS</p> <p>T-Boz has written songs, performed them, did the choreography for TLC’s videos, conceived of the videos, written a book of poems, written movies, and now this memoir.</p> <p>People sometimes say, “I can’t be creative”. Or, “I don’t have the talent”. Or “I can do X, but not Y”.</p> <p>Not true. Creativity is a muscle. Find some small way to be creative every day and the muscle gets developed. For me, today is the first day I’m going to try to do standup in the same day at two different clubs. I’m scared.</p> <p>Find one thing scary and challenging and creative every day.</p> <p>What happens then? Everything.</p> <p>SAY WHAT YOU MEAN</p> <p>A lot of pop music today is created by people who have reverse engineered “the hit”. There’s even a book about it, “The Hit Factory”, about a group of kids in Sweden who have basically written most hits you’ve heard in the past year.</p> <p>But the key to TLC’s success was that they were always writing the songs that were important to them:</p> <p>“Unpretty” – about staying true to your looks and not trying to change them to fit another person’s desires. “Waterfalls” – about staying true to your dreams but not caving in to the shortcuts that destroy many lives. Hit after hit.</p> <p>“That’s the point of being an artist, right? You feel something and you have to get it out.”</p> <p>List today what your real values are. What do you believe in? What’s important to you? What’s scary to you?</p> <p>It’s a hard process to figure out who you are and what you stand for. But this unlocks the creative well and supercharges all of your relationships.</p> <p>Honesty with others begins with honesty to yourself.</p> <p>LIVE YOUR FULL LIFE TODAY</p> <p>The best way to live a full life tomorrow is to live the fullest life you can today.</p> <p>T-BOZ:</p> <p>“Life is tough. And for many years I’ve felt like I’ve worked to get sick and worked to get better, just to get sick again. I’m learning to find a balance and just live.

			<title>Ep. 248 - Noah Kagan: Stop Fighting What You Are Good At</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Noah Kagan was fired from Facebook. He was employee #30. “I think they made the right decision to fire me," he said. "One of the big realizations I’ve had in the past few years is that people need to stop fighting their natural skill. My sweet spot is getting things going. My sweet spot is promoting products I love. That was the lesson learned. What I was strong at was not what Facebook needed anymore.” He wrote about it in his free ebook “How I Lost 170 Million Dollars: My Time as #30 at Facebook”. I asked him "how does the average person know what their strong at?" That's what we talk about in this interview. Today, Noah is the CEO of sumo.com, appsumo.com and kingsumo.com. I use these sites to grow and market my business. He also hosts a great podcast, “Noah Kagan Presents” and writes for his blog, okdork.com.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 min - Noah first came on my podcast 2 years ago. He gave me a challenge: go to a coffee shop and ask for 10% off. The cashier was confused. “You want what?” “10% off,” I said. And I didn't give a reason either. My face was emotionless. She asked her Dad. “We don't do that,” he said. I could feel myself about to throw up. I was going against the normal social protocol. And endangering my life. Any time you step out of your comfort zone and risk being thrown out of the tribe, it signals a reaction in your brain: fear. But now it's much easier. I do challengers almost everyday. Noah does too. And he shared them on his podcast “Noah Kagan Presents.” We talk about more challenges you can do in this interview.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 min - “I've been experimenting with habits and figuring out how to focus on the essentials,” Noah said. “That's where I'm really starting to explore.” He gave me an example. “Look at your phone right now. What apps have you not used in the last 6 months? Delete them.” He does this with relationships, business, everything. “It helps me realize what really matters,” he said. And appreciate more of the people and places and things he interacts with. I did a similar thing about a year ago, but in a much more macro level. I got rid of everything I owned. Except 15 items. Noah asked me what I miss. “Nothing,” I said. I lied (by accident). A few special things came to mind. But, more importantly, it’s been a year and I haven't replaced it rebought anything I threw away.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9 min - After I got rid of 40 years worth of stuff, I had nowhere to live, so I started another experiment. I threw myself at the mercy of my friends…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 min - Noah says he doesn't want to hate his week so he did a week of nothing. “I had no meetings, I had no one to be around and I was alone for a week.” He started at point zero. And added back the essentials. “What things really matter in my life? What places? What people?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 min - I told Noah what I learned from getting rid of all my belongings…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 min - “People think of dieting only in health, but can you have a diet in friendships? Look at all the things that are weighing on you,” Noah said, “and start having a diet.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">16 min - Noah was the 30th employee at Facebook. “Why were you fired?” I asked. He told me about the guy who fired him. “He's rich,” he said. “But I think they made the right decision to fire me. One of the big realizations I’ve had in the past few years is people need to stop fighting their natural skill. I call it their sweet spot and my sweet spot is starting out.” Facebook didn't need that skill anymore. So they got rid of him. I wanted to know how the average person finds out what their sweet spot is...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">19 min - Noah recommends trying these two strategies to find what you’re really good at.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 min - I tell Noah one of my signature jokes from my stand up comedy…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">27 min - Noah told me about his mentor, Jonathan Coon. He founded 1-800-Contacts and funded the movie Napoleon Dynamite. He has a strategy to “reduce friction in his life.” He goes to the same restaurants and overtips the waiters. They know to seat him at the same table and give him the same meal every time.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">29 min - We talk about tipping. Noah said that if he’s ever feeling down, he just tips someone well. It makes him feel good. I take it one step further…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 min - Noah’s mentor got an Uber. “I want your house,” the Uber driver said. “I’ll tell you exactly how you can get a house like this,” Jonathan said. He was even willing to give the driver the money to start a business that day. Here’s what happened…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">35 min - We talked about podcasting. When Noah first started his show, “Noah Kagan Presents” he was recording on his iPhone. Then he asked for feedback and found out his audio quality sucked. “I think anyone can do a podcast,” he said. “But number one: can they do it for 4 years? Probably not. Number two: can they get feedback? Candid, honest feedback from the right people. You can get the wrong feedback from the wrong people, which is not helpful. And then three: can you actually improve it?” He said the key is to always ask for feedback.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">37 min - Why EVERYONE should start a podcast.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">42 min - Noah put himself out there. “Everyone should get their prostate checked,” he said. “Are you okay?” I asked. He’s fine. We kept talking about health. And how you can A/B test to see what’s really working for you.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">47 min - Noah said he tried the 5am challenge. Now he gets up at 6 or 7am. But the challenge is what got him to move the day up earlier. Don’t set goals. Set challenges.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 min - Noah told me about his no apologies, “choose yourself” challenge. He said, “Don't apologize for who you are.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">52 min - How to say, “no.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">53 min - I started wondering how people can get back on track, because again, a lot of people veer away from what they really want in life. And they recognize this. They veered away early. But want to be happy again. It’s hard because they feel this obligation as part of their day. I know it. I used to feel it too. Sometimes, I still do. But it’s rare. And I think the key to choosing yourself is closing the gap between what you want to do and have to do. Little by little. Day by day. So I asked Noah, “How do you get back on track?”  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">58 min - We discuss “the elements of a good day.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour - Noah talks about how he built his business. "If someone told me how long it took to get successful, I may not have ever started,” he said. But that’s why it’s good to be ignorant sometimes. And to just focus on what’s in front of you. "I like to work on problems I have in my life and create things I want to see exist in the world,” Noah said. We unpack this and how it relates to other areas of our lives.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 2 min - Noah’s tried to learn a bunch of new skills: chess, Hebrew, podcasting. He hired a coach or found a mentor for each one. So I asked him what he’s learned about learning...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 5 min - We talked about “beginner’s mind.” The feeling you get when something’s new. Or when you’re starting over. Noah moved to Israel after we did this podcast. “Changing relationships or jobs or locations, generally improves life,” Noah said. “For me, what I’ve noticed is that when I live in foreign countries or different cities and do work there, my curiosity is elevated.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 7 min - We talk about uncertainty. Noah said that if you’re uncertain about what you should be working on, look to your past. And remember what made you happy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 8 min - Noah and I discuss the benefits to hiring a coach or teacher when you’re learning something new.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 11 min - I explain how I personally use Noah’s business, KingSumo, and how it’s helped my businesses grow exponentially.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 15 min - Before I ended the podcast I needed new challenges from Noah. He gave me three he’s working on right now and he explains how I can incorporate each into my life.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Mark Manson is a writer, blogger and author of the "New York Times" bestseller, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F-ck". Visit his blog, markmanson.net, to read some of his best articles on self improvement, dating and relationships, culture and life choices.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 mins - I tell Mark why I didn't initially want him in the show... and why I changed my mind</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 mins - Mark and I first met at a friend’s poker game. then I ran into him a few weeks later. But I didn't remember meeting. “Hi I'm James,” I said. Then I remembered. And I realized he was the guy from the poker game… the guy who's name I kept trying to figure out all night. “I just thought you were a chill guy,” Mark said. We laughed. That's how I'd like to start all new moments in life. With a laugh.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8 min - Mark says where he got the inspiration to write his bestselling book, "The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">10 min - We talk about what “giving a fuck” actually means. And how to decide what's worthwhile. “I joke around with a lot of people,” Mark said. “I say I wanted to write a book about values...but I knew if I wrote a book about values no one would read it. So I put the F word everywhere. Because essentially what giving a fuck is is you are deciding what you care about. You are deciding what you value in your life.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12 min - So then I ask Mark how you get started?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">14 min - We talk about people pleasing. And self absorption. “It’s very common in the self help world to say, ‘Be true to yourself and follow your feelings.’ That’s nice and everything, but if I went out to 6th Avenue and started peeing on the corner just because I feel like it…” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I interrupted. “Is that your true passion? Peeing in 6th Ave. That’s your truth?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes this is my truth at the moment…” Then he got serious. “We live in a society. We’re inner-dependent on each other in many ways. So there’s tension between what you yourself want and what’s also good for the community around you. And that’s hard. I think a lot of people suffer because that balance has gotten out of whack too far one way or the other. Either their constantly people-pleasing or they’re constantly selfish and self-absorbed.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 min - I feel everyone starts out people pleasing. And adulthood is when you cross into being more independent. Not necessary self absorbed, but the part of your brain that works to increase your livelihood and sense of survival kicks in. And the struggle is to let go of the “people pleasing” aspect. The part of you that needs approval. I still struggle with this. “Choosing yourself” is choosing to give yourself the stamp of approval. I try this everyday.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17 min - Mark sold drugs when he was 13. Someone told the principal and he got kicked out of school. Six months later his parents got a divorce.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">22  min - So I asked, “What do you think your parents could have or should have done differently in this situation?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">28 min - There's a trick to having a good relationship, he told me… it's sort of an equation. Or a scale.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">31 min - He fell into a “bottomless pit” of approval. He chased every woman on campus. And learned the rules of attraction. He told me about the really sleazy pick up lines he'd use. “Does that stuff work?”I asked. “It attracts  really insecure women,” he said. And that led to his dating theory: you end up attracting what you put out.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">33 min - He took what he learned about dating to build a coaching business.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">35 min - We talk about Tucker Max’s books and how they’re often taken the wrong way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">41 min - Mark started traveling and living off his online business.

And based his nomadic life around it.  But traveling forced Mark into avoiding intimacy. He kept leaving friends behind. And later learned what he really wanted...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">47 min - I asked Mark, “When did you start giving a fuck?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">48 min - He told me how he got back to his roots to see what made him happiest</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 min - Mark explains how new and exciting experiences start to fade as you get older...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">53 min - And he told me why putting down roots and building a community was his newly discovered biggest value.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 min - Then I wanted to learn the art of. It giving a fuck. There are a lot of subtleties. So I asked, “What steps do I need to take today to stop insecurities and not care as much?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">58 min - People always ask me how to find customers or readers or a marker. The first rule is this: if you make something that’s valuable, people will show up.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 2 minutes - We talk about constantly finding different metrics to measure your success by.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 3 minutes - We talk about a chapter in Chuck Klosterman’s book,</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">But What If We're Wrong?: Thinking About the Present As If It Were the Past, on</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">what survives and how it correlates with a chapter in Mark’s book.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 6 minutes - What is the subtle art, how do you do it?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 hour 9 minutes - There are a few fundamental principles to stop giving time and energy into things that really don't matter to you.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>DO SOMETHING YOU LOVE, TO BUILD A LIFE WORTH LOVING</p> <p>"I was shot twice by the time I was 13," Wally told me. "I owned six guns. Everyone I grew up with then is dead," he said.</p> <p>He then walked back to his side of the ping pong table. He took out his iPhone. Using his iPhone as the racket, he served the ball.</p> <p>He beat me 11-0.</p> <p>"Ok," he said, "everything you are doing is wrong."</p> <p>------</p> <p>The way I held the racket was wrong. <br /> The way I stood with my legs was wrong. <br /> The way I hit the ball and then the way I followed through after the hit was all wrong. <br /> The angle of my wrist was wrong as I waited for the ball to come to my side was wrong. <br /> The way I held the racket at a slight angle to the table was wrong. <br /> My backhand was all wrong. <br /> The way I had grown up and lived my life was mostly wrong.</p> <p>He kept streaming shots at me non-stop.</p> <p>"No, no, no," he said. "No! Go up!...No!...Close the racket...No!...Use the other foot to shift weight...No! No!"</p> <p>So we stopped.</p> <p>He came over to my side of the table. He was looking down. I was afraid he was thinking, "why am I doing this?"</p> <p>He stood behind me and grabbed my arm and moved it up as if I were hitting the ball.</p> <p>"See!," he said. "Like this. Like this."</p> <p>I wanted to be friends.</p> <p>----</p> <p>I've been playing ping pong for 40 years.</p> <p>I had a table as a kid. My dad and I would play every night. We would play for hours. And during the day, my friend Jonathan and I would play matches up to 100 every day.</p> <p>I thought I was good.</p> <p>Now, after taking lessons for several months, I realized that 100% of what I had been doing for 40 years was wrong. Everything.</p> <p>I was good enough to beat people who grew up with a ping pong table. But I was really bad.</p> <p>"When I went to North Korea," Wally told me and then he started laughing, "those players were scary good."</p> <p>----</p> <p>Wally started playing ping pong. Someone saw his skill, and, as these things go, sent him away.</p> <p>In order to come back you have to go away.</p> <p>He went to Germany to study ping pong with pros. Pretty soon he was the best.</p> <p>"I've played every sport," he told me. "Wrestling, basketball, boxing, tennis, paddle tennis. Ping pong is the hardest.</p> <p>"You have to think of everything. For instance, there's 1000s of ways to serve. And there's so many things to think about when you return the ball. You have to think several moves ahead."</p> <p>Wally has seen me play chess.</p> <p>"It's EXACTLY like chess. But also physical."</p> <p>We were having a three hour lesson that day. It ended with me doing a backhand-backhand-forehand-forehand, then forehand at the other end of the table - then random.</p> <p>Then start over. He shot 100 balls at me one after the other.</p> <p>"Again! Again! Good! No! No! No! Close the racket! You're crossing over when you follow through. Just go up!"</p> <p>Ugh. I had too many bad habits. I kept doing them. How do I stop the bad habits? 40 years of bad habits are hard to get rid of.</p> <p>It's like being afraid to say "no" after 40 years of telling everyone "yes".</p> <p>We took a break.</p> <p>"Why did you go to North Korea?"</p> <p>"I like to do things that are BIG. Every year I want to make sure I do something really big. Really special.</p> <p>"I saw the North Koreans were listing a tournament so I applied and I got in! I was the only non-Asian there.</p> <p>"Once I got there they took my phone. I had no way of getting in touch with the outside world for ten days. Couldn't call my wife. If something happened there was no proof I was even there.</p> <p>"So I just played ping pong. And they were GOOD!"</p> <p>----</p> <p>"Not only were the better than me," he said, "but the entire crowd was cheering for them and booing constantly at me.</p> <p>"So I decided, forget this. Let's have fun with this. Let's make crazy shots. Let's jump up and down after every point. Let's get the crowd laughing and jumping with me. I focused on the crowd.</p> <p>"At first they were surprised. And then they started laughing with me. They were cheering me. I was losing but it didn't matter. We were all having fun.</p> <p>"Even the other North Korean players, they didn't know what to do. They were afraid to talk to me but by the end they were hugging me.</p> <p>"That was my big thing that year."</p> <p>"What about this year?" I asked</p> <p>----</p> <p>Wally made a movie.</p> <p>"The Tables" about the ping pong tables at Bryant Park.</p> <p>"No matter what is going on in your life," Wally told me, "You could be homeless, an office worker, a ping pong champ, it doesn't matter...everyone has a home at the tables in Bryant Park. It's home there."</p> <p>I watched the documentary. It's good. "It's winning awards everywhere," Wally said, "I have to go to LA this weekend because it's winning at a festival there."</p> <p>One year Wally and some friends threw a weekly party, "Naked Ping Pong". They invited everyone they knew to a friend's apartment in Tribeca that was big enough to fit a ping pong table and the few people they thought would show up.</p> <p>It got mobbed.</p> <p>So they pitched the idea of a ping pong club to Susan Sarandon and other investors. And the club, "Spin" was born. That's where Wally has been giving me the lessons. Now Spin has locations all over the country.</p> <p>After one three hour lesson I was exhausted. I didn't think ping pong could be so tiring. We went upstairs.</p> <p>"I'm going to Israel next week because one of my students is in a big tournament there."</p> <p>---</p> <p>It's a cliche to say, "Life is short". It's a cliche to say, "You only have one life."</p> <p>But if you take one chance a year, something unexpected, something you love, you build a life worth loving.</p> <p>So many times I've spent years just struggling for money, thinking it will buy happiness. What a waste!</p> <p>We scheduled our next lesson. Then Wally showed me his unicycle Segway. I think it's called a Ninebot.</p> <p>"I have to head off to the tables," he told me. "I always like to play there every day."</p> <p>He stood on the Ninebot and he started weaving in and out of the crowd as he cruised down the sidewalk on his robotic unicycle. Then he was gone.</p> <p>I was exhausted, I went down into the subway to practice doing standup comedy again with an unfriendly crowd.</p> <p>I want to do my special thing each year. I want my life to compound into wonder.</p> <p>I went into the subway. I opened my mouth and started...</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>When Patton Oswalt, one of the top comedians over the past several decades, was going through the worst experiences of his life this past year, he wrote an entire post about one joke Gary Gulman made. ONE JOKE.</p> <p>Oswalt starts off:</p> <p>“This is…so perfect.”</p> <p>I like the pause in there. LIke there are no words so he had to notch himself down even though it doesn’t express exactly what he wants to say: … “so perfect”.</p> <p>He analyzes Gary’s joke and why it’s so difficult to do a joke like this (nobody sees how the sausage is made, they only see the final joke after years of perfecting).</p> <p>Patton closes with: “Thank you Gary Gulman. I know a lot of my shit’s gonna get angry these next four years, but it’s stuff like what Gary’s doing that reminds me I gotta make sure it’s funny first. Angry doesn’t change shit. Funny disarms the horde.”</p> <p>Gary is one of the best in the world. And no matter what area of life you want to improve in, studying in detail someone who is among the best, will up your game.</p> <p>It ups my game. I am infinitely frail. I fall apart at the slightest resistance. I sometimes can’t handle it. I sometimes can’t handle failing. I don’t always believe you learn from failure.</p> <p>But studying the best, makes my brain feel good. Like it’s being nourished. And that often gives me the strength to persist.</p> <p>For the past five months I’ve been going up on a stage 2-3 times a week and performing standup comedy in front of an audience.</p> <p>Often the other performers are people who were on the Colbert Show the night before. Or just released an hour-long Netflix special.</p> <p>So I have to up my game all the time. I want to be “one of them”. And I don’t want people in the audience to be able to tell that I’m different.</p> <p>Plus, I get scared to death. I am honestly so scared I am about to cry every time I am about to go on stage. Even if I’m going on stage to perform just five minutes of jokes. Five minutes is an eternity.</p> <p>What I realized, and will save for a future post, is that there are at least 20 or 30 (and probably much more) “micro-skills” that I could not have possibly imagined when trying to get better at standup comedy.</p> <p>I’ve been public speaking for 20 years. Is it that different?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>Which is why I had to have Gary Gulman on the podcast. One of the best in the world.</p> <p>I said above “five minutes is an eternity”.</p> <p>Gary told one joke on Conan in 2016 that lasted six minutes. One joke where (and I measured it) he gets laughs every ten to fifteen seconds throughout.</p> <p>He uses every skill in the comic’s toolbox. And probably many more that I haven’t been able to understand yet.</p> <p>I printed up the joke. I gave it to Gary. I said, “I want to analyze this joke word by word.”</p> <p>The first thing he said is, “This almost depresses me”.</p> <p>“How come?”</p> <p>“It took years to write this joke. And the others that I came out with around then. It’s so hard. Sometimes I can’t’ even get up because it’s so hard to do this.”</p> <p>What follows is one of my favorite podcasts. We cover his career, the techniques he learned and how he learned them.</p> <p>We cover the depression and anxiety and fear that goes into building any career out of excellence. We cover the micro-skills.</p> <p>No matter what you do in life, the one who masters all the master skills of your field of endeavor will be the one who rises to the top. How do you identify those skills? How do you master them?</p> <p>And we analyze this joke. To see the joke, Google: “<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLECCmKnrys">Youtube Gary Gulman Conan States</a>”. It’s his 7/13/16 performance. Watch it first.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are some things I learned:</p> <p>Part A) DELIVERY</p> <p>1. COMMITMENT</p> <p>The whole joke is about the states and how they were abbreviated. Gary walks out on stage, “I just wanted to recommend a documentary to everyone and then I’m going to go.” Everyone laughs.</p> <p>No one believes him. But he’s totally COMMITTED to the joke.</p> <p>In the podcast he says, “I’m bragging, really. Because I know I have something in my pocket that I’ve polished so frequently over the years. Years and years have gone into this one joke. And I know they haven’t seen it. It’s almost like I’m say, ‘Wait till you get a load of me.’”</p> <p>A lot of comedians just pander for a laugh, especially in the beginning. Yes, fart jokes work. But GREAT comedy is art.</p> <p>Gary’s worked hard and he’s know it. This transcends more than just jokes. People won’t always know that what you have to offer is valuable to them. Until you show it.</p> <p>That’s how Gary builds rapport with the audience. They sense the commitment. They are in for the ride.</p> <p>2. BUILD UP CAPITAL</p> <p>Audiences are terrifying. And often they don’t know you.</p> <p>Might be a business audience in a meeting. Might be a reader. Might be a listener or a crowd. Or a comedy club audience.</p> <p>They have to like you. Johnny Carson has said that this is the most important skill for a comedian.</p> <p>Likeability.</p> <p>Watch Gary’s clip and see how he becomes naturally likeable to the audience. These are techniques that can be used in every situation.</p> <p>But it’s also how you build up capital so now you can take chances, propose ideas they have never heard of, build rapport with each person listening to you, and perform the magic trick of transmitting what you see in your head, into the heads of all the listeners.</p> <p>I didn’t realize this was such an important skill at first.</p> <p>Again, I have another post about this. But, for me, the results were disastrous when I didn’t realize how important this was.</p> <p>3. MOVE</p> <p>Gary uses movement. It’s almost like he’s acting out the joke.</p> <p>He points to the sky, everyone’s eyes move up. They’re with him. They’re in the story. “I need to keep their attention during that time because it’s a lull,” he said.</p> <p>You can’t just tell your joke. Or tell your story. Or tell your idea. Ideas, jokes, stories are three dimensional.</p> <p>Gary takes his joke and turns it from a premise into a three dimensional world we are suddenly all living in.</p> <p> </p> <p>Part B) WRITING</p> <p>4. OBSERVE THE ABSURD</p> <p>Throughout my entire life, I’ve been abbreviating states.  I’ve never thought, “Oh so many states start with the same two letters.”</p> <p>Who thinks of that?</p> <p>“What were you doing when you first thought of that?” I asked him.</p> <p>“I think the first time was when I was in 2nd grade and I got the arrow book of the states. I got it in 2nd grade but it must’ve been printed several years prior because the abbreviations was a new concept in this particular version of the Arrow Book of States. For whatever reason, I wanted to memorize the abbreviations. That’s when I noticed how difficult it was.”</p> <p>Thirty years later, he turned that difficulty into a joke.</p> <p>I notice this with comedians. They observe everything out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Seinfeld once said that a regular person goes into Bar Mitzvah and says, “nice buffett”. A comedian will go in and say, “why is there pork?”</p> <p>I’ve been working on a joke lately. The premise is that OJ Simpson made $2.7 million while he was in prison. The premise doesn’t have to be funny. Just quirky. The punchline can come after years of work. Not in my case but in the case of the best comedians, jokes, speakers, inventors.</p> <p>5. PERSISTENCE AND DEPRESSION</p> <p>This is unique to Gary. He’s able to draw out jokes for 6 minutes. I asked how he’s going to get down to writing the next 6 minute bit.</p> <p>“It’s daunting,” he said.</p> <p>“How do you deal with the anxiety?”</p> <p>“I’ll say this, but it’s something that’s very personal to me. Hopefully it will help people. But I was in the hospital for a few nights because of my depression and anxiety. I was overwhelmed. It was a couple of months ago. I wasn’t suicidal. I just went to the emergency room and they admitted me and changed some medicines up, but it’s literally crippling.”</p> <p>“Did that help? The combination of medicine and them talking?”</p> <p>“Yeah…I’m in a better position now then I was then. I can function a little bit better and I’ve been able to get back on stage.”</p> <p>He said he had a fear of performing. Which was amazing to me because he’s so good at it.</p> <p>But I get it. I can’t go on stage without having a panic attack. And I know he’s been on stage 1000s of times.</p> <p>It’s hard. But once you say, “This is too hard”, that’s when you have to do it to get better. And improvement never ends.</p> <p>That’s why I wanted to learn from him.</p> <p>It’s easy for a comedian to tell crude jokes. Gary brings you into new territory.</p> <p>He told me that once he got a hold of the abbreviations joke, he held on. “I tried to strengthen it and lengthen it.”</p> <p>We kept dissecting. I wanted to get deeper into the toolkit. How did he make the joke stronger?</p> <p>6. GO OFF ON TANGENTS</p> <p>He’s a few minutes into the joke. They’re talking about abbreviating the first state (Alabama). Alaska is next. But he had to take the audience away from the story.</p> <p>Or they’d lose interest.</p> <p>He sets the scene. The whole team of abbreviators is eating breakfast. And Gary says, “The omelette station had just been invented and was sweeping the nation.”</p> <p>“I’ve always felt uncomfortable with the omelette station,” he told me. I never thought about it before.</p> <p>Hidden truths surround us. Ghosts in a conversation. But saying them brings the discomfort into comfort. Makes the scary…funny. Or possible. Or gives us a new way of looking at things.</p> <p>“The omelette chef must hate us,” he said. <br /> <br /> And in the joke Gary says they wanted to be a “chef chef.” Not an omelette chef.</p> <p>The tangent diverts your attention away from the main plot. He adds another about the people who call Hollandaise sauce “holiday sauce.” This has nothing to do with the joke. But it’s funny and adds depth to the story. And does it have to do with the joke..? Maybe!</p> <p>And then brings it back to abbreviations. Alaska is right after Alabama.</p> <p>Both are AL. That’s when the “crack team of abbreviators” realize they’re in trouble. “Did we already use AL?”</p> <p>7. BE SPECIFIC</p> <p>In one of his first lines, Gary tells you the documentary is 98 minutes. Not 90, not an hour. It’s 98 minutes.</p> <p>“Why 98?” I said.</p> <p>It had to do with the number of syllables. And the exactness. Words don’t tell a story. Details tell a story.</p> <p>And it ends on a “t”. Gary knows from 20 years experience what consonants will elicit a bigger laugh.</p> <p>Micro-skills.</p> <p>8. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MEMORY LOSS</p> <p>The crack squad of abbreviations is made up of “nayer do wells.”</p> <p>I didn’t even know what that meant. “I like to use language that you forgot you knew,” he said.</p> <p>9. PUT LAUGH LINES TOGETHER</p> <p>Gary quoted the late Richard Jeni, who said, “What you’re trying to do is put together as many laugh lines as close together as possible.”</p> <p>You don’t have to wait long to laugh again when you watch his act. Gary does this too. He makes a small reference.</p> <p>“I want to say it was 1973… So I will.”</p> <p>And the whole crowd laughs. At first, I couldn’t figure out why I was laughing. “It’s a cliche,” Gary said. He uses a cliche to make fun of cliches.</p> <p>He makes you take a second look at some statement everyone says, but no one realizes they’re saying.</p> <p>10. SUBTRACT SELF-KNOWLEDGE</p> <p>The joke gets more and more ridiculous with each line. But Gary looks almost clueless. He’s going on and on about this documentary, their struggles and challenges.</p> <p>It’s almost like he crosses this invisible line where he’s no longer aware. He becomes part of the story.</p> <p>And his comedy turns from joke to performance.</p> <p>Everyone in the audience begins to see there’s no real documentary. Except Gary.</p> <p>He subtracts self-knowledge which adds to the laughter. Because now people not only can’t believe how ridiculous this documentary’s premise is, but they can’t believe how ridiculous Gary is.</p> <p>Adding knowledge makes a hero. Subtracting knowledge makes comedy.</p> <p>James Bond can get shot in the heart, perform surgery on himself, and then get the bad guy. He’s a hero.</p> <p>If Woody Allen is shot in the heart then….even picturing it makes me laugh.</p> <p>11. TAKE RISKS</p> <p>Gary makes jokes out of difficulties, adds specificity, tangents, cliches and so on.</p> <p>He has his tool kit. Each element has a purpose. And they all take him to the edge.</p> <p>“That’s one of the reasons I’m moving to Boston,” he said. “I can take more risks.”</p> <p>“What does it mean to take more risks?” I said.</p> <p>“Just to go on stage with material that is not as worked out as the one we went over today.”</p> <p>He wants to test his joke in front of audiences, then record it and tweak it.</p> <hr /> <p>If you can’t take risks, you won’t hit the edge. You won’t go beyond it.</p> <p>Beyond the edge is peak performance. The area few, if any, hit. <br /> Beyond the edge is success. Because people reward the ones who have mastered the risks beyond the edge.</p> <p>I always say I don’t like to hit “publish” on an article until I’m afraid of what people will think.</p> <p>That’s not quite true for this article. I’m proud to say Gary is one of the best there is. I’m happy I got a chance to take my absolute favorite joke and get the guy who told it to answer all my questions for an hour.</p> <p>I felt bad when Gary expressed his depression. His desire to continually improve and his fear of where that next improvement might come from.</p> <p>We’re all afraid.</p> <p>I wanted to tell him…sometimes when I feel that way, and I feel that way almost every day, I often know that something new is going to happen. Something that will push me forward.</p> <p>Afterwards, I felt bad I didn’t say that. I wanted to tell him how skilled he is. That he will push forward.</p> <p>But I didn’t say that either. I’m hitting publish here not because I’m afraid. But because I want everyone else to experience the pure joy I felt when I listened to this joke, listened to how he crafted it, and learned a bit more about how in any area of life I can strive to improve and be the best I can be.</p>]]></description>

I fall apart at the slightest resistance. I sometimes can’t handle it. I sometimes can’t handle failing. I don’t always believe you learn from failure.</p> <p>But studying the best, makes my brain feel good. Like it’s being nourished. And that often gives me the strength to persist.</p> <p>For the past five months I’ve been going up on a stage 2-3 times a week and performing standup comedy in front of an audience.</p> <p>Often the other performers are people who were on the Colbert Show the night before. Or just released an hour-long Netflix special.</p> <p>So I have to up my game all the time. I want to be “one of them”. And I don’t want people in the audience to be able to tell that I’m different.</p> <p>Plus, I get scared to death. I am honestly so scared I am about to cry every time I am about to go on stage. Even if I’m going on stage to perform just five minutes of jokes. Five minutes is an eternity.</p> <p>What I realized, and will save for a future post, is that there are at least 20 or 30 (and probably much more) “micro-skills” that I could not have possibly imagined when trying to get better at standup comedy.</p> <p>I’ve been public speaking for 20 years. Is it that different?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>Which is why I had to have Gary Gulman on the podcast. One of the best in the world.</p> <p>I said above “five minutes is an eternity”.</p> <p>Gary told one joke on Conan in 2016 that lasted six minutes. One joke where (and I measured it) he gets laughs every ten to fifteen seconds throughout.</p> <p>He uses every skill in the comic’s toolbox. And probably many more that I haven’t been able to understand yet.</p> <p>I printed up the joke. I gave it to Gary. I said, “I want to analyze this joke word by word.”</p> <p>The first thing he said is, “This almost depresses me”.</p> <p>“How come?”</p> <p>“It took years to write this joke. And the others that I came out with around then. It’s so hard. Sometimes I can’t’ even get up because it’s so hard to do this.”</p> <p>What follows is one of my favorite podcasts. We cover his career, the techniques he learned and how he learned them.</p> <p>We cover the depression and anxiety and fear that goes into building any career out of excellence. We cover the micro-skills.</p> <p>No matter what you do in life, the one who masters all the master skills of your field of endeavor will be the one who rises to the top. How do you identify those skills? How do you master them?</p> <p>And we analyze this joke. To see the joke, Google: “<a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLECCmKnrys">Youtube Gary Gulman Conan States</a>”. It’s his 7/13/16 performance. Watch it first.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are some things I learned:</p> <p>Part A) DELIVERY</p> <p>1. COMMITMENT</p> <p>The whole joke is about the states and how they were abbreviated. Gary walks out on stage, “I just wanted to recommend a documentary to everyone and then I’m going to go.” Everyone laughs.</p> <p>No one believes him. But he’s totally COMMITTED to the joke.</p> <p>In the podcast he says, “I’m bragging, really. Because I know I have something in my pocket that I’ve polished so frequently over the years. Years and years have gone into this one joke. And I know they haven’t seen it. It’s almost like I’m say, ‘Wait till you get a load of me.’”</p> <p>A lot of comedians just pander for a laugh, especially in the beginning. Yes, fart jokes work. But GREAT comedy is art.</p> <p>Gary’s worked hard and he’s know it. This transcends more than just jokes. People won’t always know that what you have to offer is valuable to them. Until you show it.</p> <p>That’s how Gary builds rapport with the audience. They sense the commitment. They are in for the ride.</p> <p>2. BUILD UP CAPITAL</p> <p>Audiences are terrifying. And often they don’t know you.</p> <p>Might be a business audience in a meeting. Might be a reader. Might be a listener or a crowd. Or a comedy club audience.</p> <p>They have to like you. Johnny Carson has said that this is the most important skill for a comedian.</p> <p>Likeability.</p> <p>Watch Gary’s clip and see how he becomes naturally likeable to the audience. These are techniques that can be used in every situation.</p> <p>But it’s also how you build up capital so now you can take chances, propose ideas they have never heard of, build rapport with each person listening to you, and perform the magic trick of transmitting what you see in your head, into the heads of all the listeners.</p> <p>I didn’t realize this was such an important skill at first.</p> <p>Again, I have another post about this. But, for me, the results were disastrous when I didn’t realize how important this was.</p> <p>3. MOVE</p> <p>Gary uses movement. It’s almost like he’s acting out the joke.</p> <p>He points to the sky, everyone’s eyes move up. They’re with him. They’re in the story. “I need to keep their attention during that time because it’s a lull,” he said.</p> <p>You can’t just tell your joke. Or tell your story. Or tell your idea. Ideas, jokes, stories are three dimensional.</p> <p>Gary takes his joke and turns it from a premise into a three dimensional world we are suddenly all living in.</p> <p> </p> <p>Part B) WRITING</p> <p>4. OBSERVE THE ABSURD</p> <p>Throughout my entire life, I’ve been abbreviating states.  I’ve never thought, “Oh so many states start with the same two letters.”</p> <p>Who thinks of that?</p> <p>“What were you doing when you first thought of that?” I asked him.</p> <p>“I think the first time was when I was in 2nd grade and I got the arrow book of the states. I got it in 2nd grade but it must’ve been printed several years prior because the abbreviations was a new concept in this particular version of the Arrow Book of States. For whatever reason, I wanted to memorize the abbreviations. That’s when I noticed how difficult it was.”</p> <p>Thirty years later, he turned that difficulty into a joke.</p> <p>I notice this with comedians. They observe everything out of the ordinary.</p> <p>Seinfeld once said that a regular person goes into Bar Mitzvah and says, “nice buffett”. A comedian will go in and say, “why is there pork?”</p> <p>I’ve been working on a joke lately. The premise is that OJ Simpson made $2.7 million while he was in prison. The premise doesn’t have to be funny. Just quirky. The punchline can come after years of work. Not in my case but in the case of the best comedians, jokes, speakers, inventors.</p> <p>5. PERSISTENCE AND DEPRESSION</p> <p>This is unique to Gary. He’s able to draw out jokes for 6 minutes. I asked how he’s going to get down to writing the next 6 minute bit.</p> <p>“It’s daunting,” he said.</p> <p>“How do you deal with the anxiety?”</p> <p>“I’ll say this, but it’s something that’s very personal to me. Hopefully it will help people. But I was in the hospital for a few nights because of my depression and anxiety. I was overwhelmed. It was a couple of months ago. I wasn’t suicidal. I just went to the emergency room and they admitted me and changed some medicines up, but it’s literally crippling.”</p> <p>“Did that help? The combination of medicine and them talking?”</p> <p>“Yeah…I’m in a better position now then I was then. I can function a little bit better and I’ve been able to get back on stage.”</p> <p>He said he had a fear of performing. Which was amazing to me because he’s so good at it.</p> <p>But I get it. I can’t go on stage without having a panic attack. And I know he’s been on stage 1000s of times.</p> <p>It’s hard. But once you say, “This is too hard”, that’s when you have to do it to get better. And improvement never ends.</p> <p>That’s why I wanted to learn from him.</p> <p>It’s easy for a comedian to tell crude jokes. Gary brings you into new territory.</p> <p>He told me that once he got a hold of the abbreviations joke, he held on. “I tried to strengthen it and lengthen it.”</p> <p>We kept dissecting. I wanted to get deeper into the toolkit. How did he make the joke stronger?</p> <p>6. GO OFF ON TANGENTS</p> <p>He’s a few minutes into the joke. They’re talking about abbreviating the first state (Alabama). Alaska is next. But he had to take the audience away from the story.</p> <p>Or they’d lose interest.</p> <p>He sets the scene. The whole team of abbreviators is eating breakfast. And Gary says, “The omelette station had just been invented and was sweeping the nation.”</p> <p>“I’ve always felt uncomfortable with the omelette station,” he told me. I never thought about it before.</p> <p>Hidden truths surround us. Ghosts in a conversation. But saying them brings the discomfort into comfort. Makes the scary…funny. Or possible. Or gives us a new way of looking at things.</p> <p>“The omelette chef must hate us,” he said.   And in the joke Gary says they wanted to be a “chef chef.” Not an omelette chef.</p> <p>The tangent diverts your attention away from the main plot. He adds another about the people who call Hollandaise sauce “holiday sauce.” This has nothing to do with the joke. But it’s funny and adds depth to the story. And does it have to do with the joke..? Maybe!</p> <p>And then brings it back to abbreviations. Alaska is right after Alabama.</p> <p>Both are AL. That’s when the “crack team of abbreviators” realize they’re in trouble. “Did we already use AL?”</p> <p>7. BE SPECIFIC</p> <p>In one of his first lines, Gary tells you the documentary is 98 minutes. Not 90, not an hour. It’s 98 minutes.</p> <p>“Why 98?” I said.</p> <p>It had to do with the number of syllables. And the exactness. Words don’t tell a story. Details tell a story.</p> <p>And it ends on a “t”. Gary knows from 20 years experience what consonants will elicit a bigger laugh.</p> <p>Micro-skills.</p> <p>8. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MEMORY LOSS</p> <p>The crack squad of abbreviations is made up of “nayer do wells.”</p> <p>I didn’t even know what that meant. “I like to use language that you forgot you knew,” he said.</p> <p>9. PUT LAUGH LINES TOGETHER</p> <p>Gary quoted the late Richard Jeni, who said, “What you’re trying to do is put together as many laugh lines as close together as possible.”</p> <p>You don’t have to wait long to laugh again when you watch his act. Gary does this too. He makes a small reference.</p> <p>“I want to say it was 1973… So I will.”</p> <p>And the whole crowd laughs. At first, I couldn’t figure out why I was laughing. “It’s a cliche,” Gary said. He uses a cliche to make fun of cliches.</p> <p>He makes you take a second look at some statement everyone says, but no one realizes they’re saying.</p> <p>10. SUBTRACT SELF-KNOWLEDGE</p> <p>The joke gets more and more ridiculous with each line. But Gary looks almost clueless. He’s going on and on about this documentary, their struggles and challenges.</p> <p>It’s almost like he crosses this invisible line where he’s no longer aware. He becomes part of the story.</p> <p>And his comedy turns from joke to performance.</p> <p>Everyone in the audience begins to see there’s no real documentary. Except Gary.</p> <p>He subtracts self-knowledge which adds to the laughter. Because now people not only can’t believe how ridiculous this documentary’s premise is, but they can’t believe how ridiculous Gary is.</p> <p>Adding knowledge makes a hero. Subtracting knowledge makes comedy.</p> <p>James Bond can get shot in the heart, perform surgery on himself, and then get the bad guy. He’s a hero.</p> <p>If Woody Allen is shot in the heart then….even picturing it makes me laugh.</p> <p>11. TAKE RISKS</p> <p>Gary makes jokes out of difficulties, adds specificity, tangents, cliches and so on.</p> <p>He has his tool kit. Each element has a purpose. And they all take him to the edge.</p> <p>“That’s one of the reasons I’m moving to Boston,” he said. “I can take more risks.”</p> <p>“What does it mean to take more risks?” I said.</p> <p>“Just to go on stage with material that is not as worked out as the one we went over today.”</p> <p>He wants to test his joke in front of audiences, then record it and tweak it.</p>  <p>If you can’t take risks, you won’t hit the edge. You won’t go beyond it.</p> <p>Beyond the edge is peak performance. The area few, if any, hit.  Beyond the edge is success. Because people reward the ones who have mastered the risks beyond the edge.</p> <p>I always say I don’t like to hit “publish” on an article until I’m afraid of what people will think.</p> <p>That’s not quite true for this article. I’m proud to say Gary is one of the best there is. I’m happy I got a chance to take my absolute favorite joke and get the guy who told it to answer all my questions for an hour.</p> <p>I felt bad when Gary expressed his depression. His desire to continually improve and his fear of where that next improvement might come from.</p> <p>We’re all afraid.</p> <p>I wanted to tell him…sometimes when I feel that way, and I feel that way almost every day, I often know that something new is going to happen. Something that will push me forward.</p> <p>Afterwards, I felt bad I didn’t say that. I wanted to tell him how skilled he is. That he will push forward.</p> <p>But I didn’t say that either. I’m hitting publish here not because I’m afraid. But because I want everyone else to experience the pure joy I felt when I listened to this joke, listened to how he crafted it, and learned a bit more about how in any area of life I can strive to improve and be the best I can be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Berenson had the dream job. But he was unhappy. And perhaps it even scarred him in some ways.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He switched it up. To his true dreams. To the dreams he had for himself since he was a child.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to do this.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, Alex has written 11 bestselling thriller novels. Alex knows how to get the reader to turn the page and ask, “What happens next?!”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an unbelievably hard skill.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not the  most  important skill when you are moving into your dream job.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will tell you the most important skill. And Alex explains more clearly how he did it when we are in the podcast.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important  skill is to have this weird sort of “active arrogance”.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the gap: The best in your profession have skills, experience, and they know how to sit down and DO something every day.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beginners: they WANT to do something. They PLAN to do something. They SAY they will eventually do it. They THINK they have the skills they need.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they never do it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ones who succeeed. They have the arrogance to think they can just simply sit down and do it. .Despite not having the skills. Despite being total amataurs. They simply sit down and DO IT.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By doing it, you LEARN the skills, you DO the job [a first novel in Alex’s case], and you get better.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DOING is the only way to succeed. Most poeple stop before this point. Alex didn’t.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And thank god. Because his 11 bestsellers have been lifesavers for me. A way for me to dream. A way for me to escape.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how Alex did it:</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p>[6:25] - Create your own universe</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2003 and 2004, I went to Iraq for the paper,” he said (he worked at The New York Times). “The war had ended, supposedly… we deposed Saddam. Most reporters go during the ‘active phase,’ so The Times said any cub reporter could put their hand up and go. So I put my hand up.” Then he came back and realized he had stories. And John Wells was born. Alex has written 11 bestsellers. All page-turners. I wanted to know what made him start writing thrillers. I’ve always thought of writing fiction. I still wonder if that’s what’s next.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what he told me, “In my universe, nobody lies to me. They can lie to each other, they can even lie to themselves, they cannot lie to me.”</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p>[11:00] - Some luck goes unnoticed</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coming back to the states was a shock,” he said. “The wastefulness of this country really smacks you when you’ve been away for a while, certainly in a place like that.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean? What’s an example?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the example that struck me is the electrical grid.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take it for granted that the lights go on. And then use them like crazy. I live in NY. The lights are always on. It doesn’t matter what time. And I never think about it. “American is a place of abundance,” Alex said. “I guess that’s a good thing. It’s better to be rich than poor but realize that 80% of the world is never going to live in conditions anything like this. It really does just smack you in the face to realize how lucky we are and how little we realize that.”</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p>[12:00] - Choose yourself</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Alex if he thinks we’re becoming complacent as a society. “Thats a real fear,” Alex said. There are two sides. One side is if you give people everything will they stop wanting to work? Will they say they have enough. And give up.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then the other side is you work so hard and go nowhere. “The flip side of that is if you make the system so unfair that nobody believes hard work can get you ahead, they’re not going to work either.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I think that’s why work should be more than a paycheck. There has to be a vision. And following that vision is how you choose yourself.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>[15:00] - Have a little arrogance</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex said a lot of reporters want to write novels. He was one of them. But there’s something that separates those who write from those who don’t...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did something arrogant,” he said. “I wrote a novel.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I wondered if that’s part of the formula? Do all novelists have some arrogance to write something totally made up and think other people will want to read it?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course,” Alex said. “Are you kidding? It’s the craziest endeavor. ‘I’m going to create this world with these fake people and I want you to believe they’re real. And I want to make them come alive for you.’”</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p>[17:17] - Finding aspects of you</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m curious about the characters. Like dreams, where do they come from? Is it a manifestation of yourself? Of people you know? And who leads the story? Is it the writer? Some writers say the characters are so strong psychologically that they lead the story.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex got his answer from his wife. She’s a psychiatrist. She says John Wells is a projection of Alex’s most idealized version of himself. “He’s strong, he’s very capable, he’s so tough. Women love him, men fear him, sheep want to be with him, ya know he’s tortured because he’s committed all this violence over the years, but he’s essentially a good guy.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder what it would be like to create my own universe and then ask a doctor to read into me. But I only know what I create if I start creating.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>[19:22] - How do you survive?</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His books are 400 pages each. And that’s before everything gets cut down and reformatted. He used to write before work. Now it’s his full time job.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So how do you survive? How do you sit through it?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Writing the books is mentally painful,” he said. “I make the characters suffer. Because I’m suffering.”</span></p> <p><br /> <br /> <br /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:13] Who’s your hero?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know more about Alex’s hero. He could’ve made the everyman. But instead he chose a spy, someone who in danger. Maybe it’s a reflection of who we want to be. Someone with real freedom.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex said. “When you have nothing to lose, when you don’t care if you live or die, you have incredible freedom.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex doesn't have that freedom. He told me how he was almost kidnapped in Iraq. “People thought I was spy,” he said. ““I had a very close call. I mean everyone has a close call, but I had a very close call”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was your close call?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ya know, I don’t like to talk about it.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t let this go. When someone comes on my podcast, I have one chance to ask them everything I want to know.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could we please talk about it?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I found a notebook that a Shia fighter kept… It was just a tiny green notebook. It was in the rubble of a building. And I took it.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They saw you pick it up?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No… I was dressed like a local. I had a goatee. I had my haircut shorter, but no one was going to be fooled into thinking I was Iraqi. No one who REALLY looked at me. And I didn’t speak arabic”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People got suspicious of him.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question was, ‘What are you doing? Why do you look like this? Why are you trying to pass… you’re not one of us. And once that happened, it just spiraled.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you reached a point where you got scared,” I said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, no no no no. It was much worse than that…”</span></p> <p> </p> <p>[34:16] - Get stories</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know how Alex got back home. He was detained. And almost martyred.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These experiences lead to his novels. Now, he had stories to begin fueling the John Wells series.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>[43:34] - Write everyday</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People ask Alex how he gets his inspiration.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a mortgage to pay and I have a contract. I can’t wait for inspiration.” He says he makes progress everyday.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>[44:30] - How do you get people to turn the page?</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex turned the tables. He asked if I wrote a page-turned.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer’s no. I tried. I’ve tried for 20 years. He said one key is to let people read your work. I’ve never let anyone read my fiction.

And finally landed on this:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to build. “For Wells, there’s always tensions.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alex Berenson had the dream job. But he was unhappy. And perhaps it even scarred him in some ways.</p> <p> </p> <p>He switched it up. To his true dreams. To the dreams he had for himself since he was a child.</p> <p> </p> <p>I want to do this.</p> <p> </p> <p>First off, Alex has written 11 bestselling thriller novels. Alex knows how to get the reader to turn the page and ask, “What happens next?!”</p> <p> </p> <p>This is an unbelievably hard skill.</p> <p> </p> <p>But it’s not the  most  important skill when you are moving into your dream job.</p> <p> </p> <p>I will tell you the most important skill. And Alex explains more clearly how he did it when we are in the podcast.</p> <p> </p> <p>The most important  skill is to have this weird sort of “active arrogance”.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s the gap: The best in your profession have skills, experience, and they know how to sit down and DO something every day.</p> <p> </p> <p>The beginners: they WANT to do something. They PLAN to do something. They SAY they will eventually do it. They THINK they have the skills they need.</p> <p> </p> <p>But they never do it.</p> <p> </p> <p>The ones who succeeed. They have the arrogance to think they can just simply sit down and do it. .Despite not having the skills. Despite being total amataurs. They simply sit down and DO IT.</p> <p> </p> <p>By doing it, you LEARN the skills, you DO the job [a first novel in Alex’s case], and you get better.</p> <p> </p> <p>DOING is the only way to succeed. Most poeple stop before this point. Alex didn’t.</p> <p> </p> <p>And thank god. Because his 11 bestsellers have been lifesavers for me. A way for me to dream. A way for me to escape.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s how Alex did it:</p> <p> </p> <p>[6:25] - Create your own universe</p> <p> </p> <p>“In 2003 and 2004, I went to Iraq for the paper,” he said (he worked at The New York Times). “The war had ended, supposedly… we deposed Saddam. Most reporters go during the ‘active phase,’ so The Times said any cub reporter could put their hand up and go. So I put my hand up.” Then he came back and realized he had stories. And John Wells was born. Alex has written 11 bestsellers. All page-turners. I wanted to know what made him start writing thrillers. I’ve always thought of writing fiction. I still wonder if that’s what’s next.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s what he told me, “In my universe, nobody lies to me. They can lie to each other, they can even lie to themselves, they cannot lie to me.”</p> <p> </p> <p>[11:00] - Some luck goes unnoticed</p> <p> </p> <p>“Coming back to the states was a shock,” he said. “The wastefulness of this country really smacks you when you’ve been away for a while, certainly in a place like that.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“What do you mean? What’s an example?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“I think the example that struck me is the electrical grid.”</p> <p> </p> <p>We take it for granted that the lights go on. And then use them like crazy. I live in NY. The lights are always on. It doesn’t matter what time. And I never think about it. “American is a place of abundance,” Alex said. “I guess that’s a good thing. It’s better to be rich than poor but realize that 80% of the world is never going to live in conditions anything like this. It really does just smack you in the face to realize how lucky we are and how little we realize that.”</p> <p> </p> <p>[12:00] - Choose yourself</p> <p>I asked Alex if he thinks we’re becoming complacent as a society. “Thats a real fear,” Alex said. There are two sides. One side is if you give people everything will they stop wanting to work? Will they say they have enough. And give up.</p> <p> </p> <p>But then the other side is you work so hard and go nowhere. “The flip side of that is if you make the system so unfair that nobody believes hard work can get you ahead, they’re not going to work either.”</p> <p> </p> <p>And I think that’s why work should be more than a paycheck. There has to be a vision. And following that vision is how you choose yourself.</p> <p> </p> <p>[15:00] - Have a little arrogance</p> <p> </p> <p>Alex said a lot of reporters want to write novels. He was one of them. But there’s something that separates those who write from those who don’t...</p> <p> </p> <p>“I did something arrogant,” he said. “I wrote a novel.”</p> <p> </p> <p>So I wondered if that’s part of the formula? Do all novelists have some arrogance to write something totally made up and think other people will want to read it?</p> <p> </p> <p>“Of course,” Alex said. “Are you kidding? It’s the craziest endeavor. ‘I’m going to create this world with these fake people and I want you to believe they’re real. And I want to make them come alive for you.’”</p> <p> </p> <p>[17:17] - Finding aspects of you</p> <p>I’m curious about the characters. Like dreams, where do they come from? Is it a manifestation of yourself? Of people you know? And who leads the story? Is it the writer? Some writers say the characters are so strong psychologically that they lead the story.</p> <p> </p> <p>Alex got his answer from his wife. She’s a psychiatrist. She says John Wells is a projection of Alex’s most idealized version of himself. “He’s strong, he’s very capable, he’s so tough. Women love him, men fear him, sheep want to be with him, ya know he’s tortured because he’s committed all this violence over the years, but he’s essentially a good guy.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I wonder what it would be like to create my own universe and then ask a doctor to read into me. But I only know what I create if I start creating.</p> <p> </p> <p>[19:22] - How do you survive?</p> <p>His books are 400 pages each. And that’s before everything gets cut down and reformatted. He used to write before work. Now it’s his full time job.</p> <p> </p> <p>“So how do you survive? How do you sit through it?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“Writing the books is mentally painful,” he said. “I make the characters suffer. Because I’m suffering.”</p> <p>  </p> <p>[26:13] Who’s your hero?</p> <p> </p> <p>I wanted to know more about Alex’s hero. He could’ve made the everyman. But instead he chose a spy, someone who in danger. Maybe it’s a reflection of who we want to be. Someone with real freedom.</p> <p> </p> <p>Alex said. “When you have nothing to lose, when you don’t care if you live or die, you have incredible freedom.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Alex doesn't have that freedom. He told me how he was almost kidnapped in Iraq. “People thought I was spy,” he said. ““I had a very close call. I mean everyone has a close call, but I had a very close call”</p> <p> </p> <p>“What was your close call?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“Ya know, I don’t like to talk about it.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I couldn’t let this go. When someone comes on my podcast, I have one chance to ask them everything I want to know.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Could we please talk about it?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“I found a notebook that a Shia fighter kept… It was just a tiny green notebook. It was in the rubble of a building. And I took it.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“They saw you pick it up?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“No… I was dressed like a local. I had a goatee. I had my haircut shorter, but no one was going to be fooled into thinking I was Iraqi. No one who REALLY looked at me. And I didn’t speak arabic”</p> <p> </p> <p>People got suspicious of him.</p> <p> </p> <p>“The question was, ‘What are you doing? Why do you look like this? Why are you trying to pass… you’re not one of us. And once that happened, it just spiraled.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“So you reached a point where you got scared,” I said.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Oh, no no no no. It was much worse than that…”</p> <p> </p> <p>[34:16] - Get stories</p> <p>I wanted to know how Alex got back home. He was detained. And almost martyred.</p> <p> </p> <p>These experiences lead to his novels. Now, he had stories to begin fueling the John Wells series.</p> <p> </p> <p>[43:34] - Write everyday</p> <p>People ask Alex how he gets his inspiration.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I have a mortgage to pay and I have a contract. I can’t wait for inspiration.” He says he makes progress everyday.</p> <p> </p> <p>[44:30] - How do you get people to turn the page?</p> <p>Alex turned the tables. He asked if I wrote a page-turned.</p> <p> </p> <p>The answer’s no. I tried. I’ve tried for 20 years. He said one key is to let people read your work. I’ve never let anyone read my fiction. I want to know the beats.</p> <p> </p> <p>We broke them down.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I’m kind of the wrong person to ask about structure,” he said. “My books violate the normal structure of genre fiction.”</p> <p> </p> <p>But I find this is true with all peak performers. They can’t explain how they do so well. It comes natural to them. So getting into the finer nuances takes effort.</p> <p> </p> <p>I dug. And here’s what I found…</p> <p> </p> <p>[54:54] - Finding structure</p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning, the main character is involved in something bad</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Then he solves it</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">And he’s given a grace period of relief</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Then he goes through something worse… Alex said, “You have to have a mission and within that mission there has to be sub-missions.”</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">It could get worse. “It depends,” Alex said. Sometime the main character gets help from somewhere else or a clue is revealed. Anything can happen.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>[58:20]  - They key to a great ending...</p> <p>Eventually it ends… But here’s the key. You need a cool solve.</p> <p> </p> <p>So I asked, “What’s a cool solve?” This is another great example of an expert knowing his craft better than the inner workings of that craft…</p> <p> </p> <p>We went through a ton of examples. And finally landed on this:</p> <p> </p> <p>You have to build. “For Wells, there’s always tensions. Your always asking, ‘How far will this go?’ You just got me to explain it better,” Alex said.</p> <p>  </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ryan Holiday, stop writing books that are just for me!</p> <p>With “Perennial Seller” you just answered an obsessive question I’ve had for years: What makes something, someone, some product, some art, withstand the test of time?</p> <p>What is the magic sauce? The secret formula?</p> <p>What makes something sell a million copies a year (music, art, books, products, etc)… forever?</p> <p>I want to know.</p> <hr /> <p>I’ll try my best to summarize our conversation and your book but people should buy the book for your 1000s of examples:</p> <p> </p> <p>BE COUNTERINTUITIVE</p> <p>If you write what everyone else is already thinking, then nobody needs to read your work, or use your product.</p> <p>They already have it.</p> <p>It doesn’t matter if you are 50% better than anyone else.</p> <p>Nobody understands how to judge that except the experts in your field. And those experts don’t care about you. They might even hate you.</p> <p>Create your own field. And be 1000% the best in that field.</p> <p> </p> <p>DON’T TRY TO COMPETE</p> <p>The 100th person who writes a “50 Shades of Grey” style book, or a disco pop EMD album can…MAYBE…get 1% of the audience.</p> <p>If you find an underserved audience, you can get 100% of it.</p> <p>There’s an important side effect of this: IF YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING FOR THE MONEY…YOU LOSE.</p> <p>Because the rest of the world is competing for that dollar.</p> <p>Money is a side effect of creativity, quality art, creating something unique, and building your marketing into that art.</p> <p> </p> <p>VALIDATE THE IDEA</p> <p>Test out sample chapters. Release songs on YouTube. Keep iterating. Keep digging for your authentic voice.</p> <p>In comedy, it took Louis CK 20 years of telling jokes before he found his voice when talking about dating and parenting.</p> <p>Don’t look for LOTs of fans at first. Look for the hard-core fans. The ones who will stick with you while you go on this crazy ride. The ones who will share.</p> <p>What my prior podcast guest, Kevin Kelly, calls “The One Thousand True Fans”.</p> <p> </p> <p>DON’T GIVE UP IF YOU DON’T WIN ON DAY ONE</p> <p>Ryan told me that “Smokey and the Bandit” beat “Star Wars” at the box office the same weekend they both opened.</p> <p>I did not know that! It almost seems like blasphemy to me.</p> <p>John Grisham only sold a few thousand copies when he first published “A Time To Kill”. Only much later did it sell millions.</p> <p>Catcher in the Rye had a slow start. Now sells a million copies a year.</p> <p>The best works of art and the best products have to fight the masses to find their right audience. But when they do, the audience will reward them.</p> <p>Write or create what is unique to you, find the 1000 true fans. The ones who are hard-core and love the value you bring. And serve that market over and over.</p> <p>That divides the winners from the non-winners.</p> <p> </p> <p>TELL A STORY THAT IS PERSONAL TO YOU</p> <p>“Choose Yourself” could have been another ranty personal development business book (“Blah!”).</p> <p>Instead I wove in a personal story of struggle and loss and pain. Pain that changed me and still does every single day to (hopefully) lesser extent.</p> <p>This is what makes a story both unique (it’s my story) and universal (everyone experiences pain, everyone wants to solve it).</p> <p>Too many people play a persona (“my life is perfect so let me teach it to you”) and that’s inauthentic.</p> <p> </p> <p>TELL A STORY THAT RESONATES WITH EVERYONE</p> <p>Star Wars is a perfect example. It’s the ‘arc of the hero’. A boy who struggles, encounters problems, faces them, lives forever. I.e. Jesus. Krishna. Buddha.</p> <p>Star Wars is a sci-fi western (great example of “idea sex”) where he innovated on the graphics but used a story that was basically “Focus grouped” for thousands of years. Thousands!</p> <p>So he stuck within the rules of a genre (actually several that he combined) but also made it uniquely his own.</p> <p>This is the key to successful art.</p> <p>Telling a story that is personal to you AND resonates with everyone is very difficult. It takes practice. It takes marketing. It takes listening. That’s why these are the items that become perennial sellers.</p> <p>It’s worth it to build that skill. How do you do it:</p> <p>- Understand the history of what you loveLearn from the best</p> <p>- Learn from the best</p> <p>- Practice over and over</p> <p>- Build marketing into your art.</p> <p>- Experiment, learn, repeat</p> <p>- Follow the rest of the advice in this article.</p> <p> </p> <p>ASK THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS</p> <p>Ask yourself, “Who is this actually for?” Who is your fan?”</p> <p>“A lot of creators struggle with this,” Ryan said. “You make this great work and then you think the world is eagerly anticipating it, but they’re not.”</p> <p>You have to have a sense of honesty internally to know who your stuff is for. So you need to ask the right questions from the beginning.</p> <p>You have to connect strongly with those initial hard core fans.</p> <p>Combine your creative idea with the heart of another human being.</p> <p>The people who struggle with your struggle. The people who will be better off when they read your writing or use your invention.</p> <p> </p> <p>BE OK WITH PEOPLE HATING YOU</p> <p>If you do something new, people will not like you. SOMEONE will hate you.</p> <p>“When the moon landing happened,” Ryan told me, “It had 93% market share. That’s incredible.</p> <p>“But think about it. That means 7% of the audience turned on the TV, saw Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon and said, ‘oh, this is boring. I’m going to change the channel.”</p> <p>Be ok with that.</p> <p>Iron Maiden had a lot of people hating them. And yet they focused on their core audience and became one of the most popular rock bands ever despite playing music that would NEVER make it on the radio.</p> <p>The TV show, “Seinfeld” was on the verge of cancellation it’s first few years.</p> <p>But Jerry Seinfeld already had a hard-core following not only among fans but even among network executives.</p> <p>Having network executives as hard-core fans guaranteed him the runway he needed to succeed with the wider audience.</p> <p>The Beatles had a hard core following from 1957 on that, even when their label rejected them in 1962 (“Guitar bands are going out of style”), their hard core fans kept them afloat and a year later they were catapulted to success.</p> <p>Your hard core fans buys you “marketing capital” that you “spend” on expanding to a wider base.</p> <p>If you go for just the wider base, you face the competition too early and end up as an also-ran.</p> <p>And remember, the moment you first start – NOBODY at all cares about you.</p> <p> </p> <p>THE BEST ART DIVIDES THE AUDIENCE.</p> <p>I don’t hit publish unless I’m actually feeling physical fear about doing it.</p> <p>If you don’t want to divide the audience, don’t hit publish.</p> <p> </p> <p>MARKET YOUR IDEA</p> <p>Nobody really cares about you. Every industry is turning upside down. Everyone is worried about their own jobs and agendas.</p> <p>You can’t just be better than everyone else. There’s “infinite shelf space” as Ryan puts it.</p> <p>You’re competing against “Breaking Bad”, Google, Trump’s tweets, old episodes of Seinfeld, Harry Potter, etc.</p> <p>If you want to be out there and noticed. If you want your vision to succeed. If you want your product used…you need to talk about it. You need to represent it. You need to write about it. You need to be about it.</p> <p>The marketing has to be part of your art. Even the Beatles made entire movies (art and marketing at the same time) to support their true creativity (the music).</p> <p>Marketing is no longer about ad space. It’s another important outlet of your creativity.</p> <p>And if it doesn’t work. Move on. You don’t have one idea in you. You have 1000s.</p> <p> </p> <p>VALIDATE, REPEAT</p> <p>Most things fail. The ones who succeed, pick up from their failure, figure out what went wrong, figure out how to validate an idea better with an audience, and then go back and try again.</p> <p>They try over and over until they find that hardcore audience that will listen.</p> <p>Validation is a cure for stupidity.</p> <p>They go back again and again until their skills are refined. John Lennon and Paul McCartney met in 1958. They played and played and played and refined.</p> <p>In 1962 their label rejected them (“Guitar bands are on their way out”).</p> <p>The rest is history.</p> <p>Now you can create history.</p> <p>And Ryan, one final note. Please keep writing all-star books so you can keep coming back on the podcast.</p> <p>And keeping writing books that will make my life better.</p> <p>And then letting me ask you any question I want about them. Because the’s the way I roll.</p> <p>You’re a good guy and, of course, welcome any time but I’m really mostly interested in reading things that make my life better. So keep at it.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

How do you do it:</p> <p>- Understand the history of what you loveLearn from the best</p> <p>- Learn from the best</p> <p>- Practice over and over</p> <p>- Build marketing into your art.</p> <p>- Experiment, learn, repeat</p> <p>- Follow the rest of the advice in this article.</p> <p> </p> <p>ASK THE ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS</p> <p>Ask yourself, “Who is this actually for?” Who is your fan?”</p> <p>“A lot of creators struggle with this,” Ryan said. “You make this great work and then you think the world is eagerly anticipating it, but they’re not.”</p> <p>You have to have a sense of honesty internally to know who your stuff is for. So you need to ask the right questions from the beginning.</p> <p>You have to connect strongly with those initial hard core fans.</p> <p>Combine your creative idea with the heart of another human being.</p> <p>The people who struggle with your struggle. The people who will be better off when they read your writing or use your invention.</p> <p> </p> <p>BE OK WITH PEOPLE HATING YOU</p> <p>If you do something new, people will not like you. SOMEONE will hate you.</p> <p>“When the moon landing happened,” Ryan told me, “It had 93% market share. That’s incredible.</p> <p>“But think about it. That means 7% of the audience turned on the TV, saw Neil Armstrong stepping on the moon and said, ‘oh, this is boring. I’m going to change the channel.”</p> <p>Be ok with that.</p> <p>Iron Maiden had a lot of people hating them. And yet they focused on their core audience and became one of the most popular rock bands ever despite playing music that would NEVER make it on the radio.</p> <p>The TV show, “Seinfeld” was on the verge of cancellation it’s first few years.</p> <p>But Jerry Seinfeld already had a hard-core following not only among fans but even among network executives.</p> <p>Having network executives as hard-core fans guaranteed him the runway he needed to succeed with the wider audience.</p> <p>The Beatles had a hard core following from 1957 on that, even when their label rejected them in 1962 (“Guitar bands are going out of style”), their hard core fans kept them afloat and a year later they were catapulted to success.</p> <p>Your hard core fans buys you “marketing capital” that you “spend” on expanding to a wider base.</p> <p>If you go for just the wider base, you face the competition too early and end up as an also-ran.</p> <p>And remember, the moment you first start – NOBODY at all cares about you.</p> <p> </p> <p>THE BEST ART DIVIDES THE AUDIENCE.</p> <p>I don’t hit publish unless I’m actually feeling physical fear about doing it.</p> <p>If you don’t want to divide the audience, don’t hit publish.</p> <p> </p> <p>MARKET YOUR IDEA</p> <p>Nobody really cares about you. Every industry is turning upside down. Everyone is worried about their own jobs and agendas.</p> <p>You can’t just be better than everyone else. There’s “infinite shelf space” as Ryan puts it.</p> <p>You’re competing against “Breaking Bad”, Google, Trump’s tweets, old episodes of Seinfeld, Harry Potter, etc.</p> <p>If you want to be out there and noticed. If you want your vision to succeed. If you want your product used…you need to talk about it. You need to represent it. You need to write about it. You need to be about it.</p> <p>The marketing has to be part of your art. Even the Beatles made entire movies (art and marketing at the same time) to support their true creativity (the music).</p> <p>Marketing is no longer about ad space. It’s another important outlet of your creativity.</p> <p>And if it doesn’t work. Move on. You don’t have one idea in you. You have 1000s.</p> <p> </p> <p>VALIDATE, REPEAT</p> <p>Most things fail. The ones who succeed, pick up from their failure, figure out what went wrong, figure out how to validate an idea better with an audience, and then go back and try again.</p> <p>They try over and over until they find that hardcore audience that will listen.</p> <p>Validation is a cure for stupidity.</p> <p>They go back again and again until their skills are refined. John Lennon and Paul McCartney met in 1958. They played and played and played and refined.</p> <p>In 1962 their label rejected them (“Guitar bands are on their way out”).</p> <p>The rest is history.</p> <p>Now you can create history.</p> <p>And Ryan, one final note. Please keep writing all-star books so you can keep coming back on the podcast.</p> <p>And keeping writing books that will make my life better.</p> <p>And then letting me ask you any question I want about them. Because the’s the way I roll.</p> <p>You’re a good guy and, of course, welcome any time but I’m really mostly interested in reading things that make my life better. So keep at it.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scot Cohen is the best networker on the planet. I have never seen anything like it. And he used that skill to make tens of millions of dollars, not only for himself but for many others.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted him to explain, in detail, how.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry, Scot. I am really, truly sorry. I am horrified at my behavior. A year of bad behavior.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine: you owe someone a phone call and you say to yourself, “Ok, I’ll call tomorrow”.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then tomorrow you say, “Well, maybe tomorrow”.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then you delayed so much you feel awkward about calling. Because you know you have to apologize and you hate confrontation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stupid, right?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s make this even worse: the person you have to call back has been incredibly generous to you. In fact, he let you stay in his apartment for three months for free. You’ve worked together for 14 years and he’s one of the most successful investors in NYC. And then you did this for no reason.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m an idiot.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day I threw out all of my belongings  and gave up my apartment I was sitting in a restaurant with my one bag and I called Scot Cohen. I said, “I’m just sitting in this restaurant.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where are you going to live?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no idea yet.” I coudl’ve just stayed in a hotel. But for various reasons I was feeling a bit down. I just wanted to sit in the restaurant. I had no idea where I would live.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on over,” Scot said. “Stay here.” And so I did. For the next three months I stayed in one of Scot’s several apartments.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I invested in Scot’s hedge fund in 2003. We’ve worked together on and off for 14 years. He’s one of the most successful hedge fund managers I know.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s made tens of millions, invested in dozens of companies that went up 1000s of percent, and I am glad that, in my own small way, I was able to help him in several situations. .</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you build your network over years, over decades, and your network is made up of good people, they help you out. They let you move in their apartment. You work on deals together to make money. You meet each others girlfriends who become wives.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then sometimes you let them down and you have to apologize.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I did. On the podcast.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how stupid and awkward I am: I hadn’t seen Scot in a year. I had stupidly avoided his calls. And so I said, “come on to the podcast and that’s where I will apologize”.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, I said, step by step we will break down and figure out</span></p> <p> </p> <p>1. HOW YOU BECAME THE BEST NETWORKER I HAVE EVER SEEN</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. HOW YOU USED THAT SKILL TO MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scot came to NYC with nothing. But he had a skill that is worth tens of millions at the highest level. It's networking at a level I've never seen before or since.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-----</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One time, a year earlier, I was sitting in his apartment. Scot rushed in, changed into a suit and rushed out.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Sunday night, 8 o’clock at night. He was rushing  from tennis with one hedge fund manager to the wedding of one of his investors.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how he made himself so successful. He networks seven days a week.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just sit around and fall asleep early.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked him on the podcast how he did it. How can I do it? How can anyone do it?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We broke down his story:</span></p> <p>1. Self awareness</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do self-work,” he said. “Really try to dial in on who you are and where you want to go, because if you don’t have that right, you’re never going to be able to get off first base.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is fundamental. It takes a while. You’ve got to have patience to play this out, so give yourself the time. You’re not going to get a quick fix. Nothing’s going to happen in three months, or a year. It’s going to take years. So get that fundamental work done on yourself first, and then you can start growing.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p>2. Keep a diary</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scot told me to write down where you want to go.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t write stuff down, how are you going to go anywhere? You’re not going to remember where you came from.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s really important to be able to quantify what you’re doing during the day,” he said. “You’ve got to keep account of how you’re spending your time. That’s the most important thing.”</span></p> <p><br /> 3. Meet people</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Scot, “What else can they do? Should they start holding dinners? Should they start figuring out who’s good, and doubling down on those relationships? Should they start coming up with ideas to connect people? What should they do?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His advice was simpler than that… just plant seeds.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Surround yourself with great people. I don’t care if it’s a plumber. I don’t care if he’s a construction worker. I don’t care if it’s a teacher, a police officer, a guy in the gym, somebody that you met at the grocery store. It doesn’t matter, but just make sure they’re kind. Make sure they’re aligned with where you want to go...”</span></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 236 - Farnoosh Torabi: Flipping the Mic - Farnoosh Interviews Me</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was my partner in crime. </span>Farnoosh recently hosted her own show on CNBC. She also has a super popular podcast. And she’s a successful book author and all around writer. But to me she’s more than that. From 2006 to 2008 we did videos together every day. We would meet on Wall Street, a video guy would tape us talking about whatever we wanted to talk about, and then we’d send that video out onto the interwebs. The day the first iphone came out we went to the Apple flagship store near Central Park. We interviewed the people who were waiting on line all night. A homeless guy started to pick on Farnoosh. Not that I am so brave but I didn’t want to seem unmanly so I stood in between the man and Farnoosh and asked him to please go away. He lifted me up and threw me to the ground. And then he went away. That was a fun story that I wanted to share. But more...Farnoosh is a textbook example of how a career can be made and be a success. She had a fulltime job learning skills she loved and then mastered: financial markets, writing, video, multimedia, communication, and the business of business. While at the full time job, she wrote a book on the markets: YOU’RE SO MONEY. From that, she no longer needed thestreet.com and diversified her sources of income by writing for many outlets, going on various TV shows, starting her own show, writing more, starting a successful and profitable podcast, and many other activities. And ten years later, we still find each other doing videos together or podcasts, or articles, or whatever. Building a career is like knitting a tapestry. It’s small thread by small thread. It takes years. It becomes beautiful. And it’s something you can fall into when it’s done for comfort and security. That tapestry becomes your network. A career is not what you created today, but the networks you built up today that will create unexpected opportunities for you ten, fifteen, twenty years later. As an example: I just did a deal with a friend of mine I began working with twenty years ago. Every day I see these opportunities. And I’m horrible at networking. Farnoosh isn’t. But there’s another reason I wanted Farnoosh on my podcast. Farnoosh is great at interviewing. And I wanted her to interview me. I find when I am a guest on other people’s podcasts I always find new ways to say the things I want to express, new ways to say what I’ve learned from my guests and my experiences. Who better to interview me than the person who has been interviewing me for almost a dozen years. “I came prepared,” she told me. Because she wanted to find out what you don’t see on Google...</p> <p>Here’s what we talked about:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of entrepreneurship and the rise of “gurus.” Farnoosh asked me, “Who should people trust?” But really, it doesn’t matter. Anytime you “study” entrepreneurship, it means you’re not DOING entrepreneurship. It’s great to have ideas. And it’s fine to read one business books (TOPS), but then that’s it. Get in the mud and starting doing. -</span> listen at 7 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farnoosh asked me, “Do you remember the first time you used the internet?”  It was before the web. I logged into a news group and could talk to people from Norway about Star Wars. Besides the phone, it was the first time I spoke to someone without being in the same room…  It was 1986. And then the web started. Hypertext came in. And I thought it would be used for storytelling. But then it became huge for commerce. Then she asked me, “What’s next?” -</span> listen at 19 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentorship and finding your inner circle -</span> listen at 25 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolution, willpower and the access economy</span> <strong>-</strong> listen at 36 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My daily schedule (the morning is my “maker” hours, in the evening I manage several businesses and at night I have fun. I do comedy.) -</span> listen at 38 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it better to focus on one thing and enjoy the subtleties of what it takes to be the best in the world at something? Or diversify? I struggle with this. Farnoosh said she bought the book, “The One Thing.” Because she wanted to get focussed. “I bought it and never finished it,” she said. The irony… she got busy doing “other” things. But maybe the other things takes us off our path, out of our delusions and shift us into doing more fulfilling learning curves. -</span> listen at 43 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story of “lucky Lisa.” That’s Farnoosh’s nickname for the friend who helped me get rid of all of my belongings -</span> listen at 53 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What about dating?” Farnoosh wondered if dating is weird for me. Because I have no home. And then we talked about renting vs owning. I used to believe in renting. But now I just borrow. It’s part of the new access economy. We live in a world of access (and Airbnb). But I eventually answer her question about dating, too. -</span> listen at 59 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we talked about money. “If you couldn’t pass on any money to your kids and all you could pass on was investment strategies, rules, a portfolio, what would it be?” -</span> listen at 1 hour and 5 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you like talking about politics?” she asked…</span> <strong>-</strong> listen at 1 hour and 10 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you vote?” No. And I don’t think it matters. Here’s why. Saying it’s your “civil responsibility” to vote is not true. I agree we all have a civil duty. I do mine by writing 300 articles a year, giving talks, doing 100 podcasts a year and giving it all away. You get to decide how you fulfil your this civil duty. If you choose voting, that’s fine. But I don’t. I don’t want to outsource my contribution. We started debating -</span> listen at 1 hour and 11 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hear the story of the time I went to Bernie Madoff and was turned away. He said, “The last thing I need is to see the name Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC on the front page of the Wall Street Journal” -</span> listen at 1 hour and 19 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to get into TV -</span> listen at 1 hour and 22 minutes</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AND the “choose yourself” method for getting into TV (how to get past the gatekeepers) -</span> listen at 1 hour and 27 minutes</p>]]></description>

We would meet on Wall Street, a video guy would tape us talking about whatever we wanted to talk about, and then we’d send that video out onto the interwebs. The day the first iphone came out we went to the Apple flagship store near Central Park. We interviewed the people who were waiting on line all night. A homeless guy started to pick on Farnoosh. Not that I am so brave but I didn’t want to seem unmanly so I stood in between the man and Farnoosh and asked him to please go away. He lifted me up and threw me to the ground. And then he went away. That was a fun story that I wanted to share. But more...Farnoosh is a textbook example of how a career can be made and be a success. She had a fulltime job learning skills she loved and then mastered: financial markets, writing, video, multimedia, communication, and the business of business. While at the full time job, she wrote a book on the markets: YOU’RE SO MONEY. From that, she no longer needed thestreet.com and diversified her sources of income by writing for many outlets, going on various TV shows, starting her own show, writing more, starting a successful and profitable podcast, and many other activities. And ten years later, we still find each other doing videos together or podcasts, or articles, or whatever. Building a career is like knitting a tapestry. It’s small thread by small thread. It takes years. It becomes beautiful. And it’s something you can fall into when it’s done for comfort and security. That tapestry becomes your network. A career is not what you created today, but the networks you built up today that will create unexpected opportunities for you ten, fifteen, twenty years later. As an example: I just did a deal with a friend of mine I began working with twenty years ago. Every day I see these opportunities. And I’m horrible at networking. Farnoosh isn’t. But there’s another reason I wanted Farnoosh on my podcast. Farnoosh is great at interviewing. And I wanted her to interview me. I find when I am a guest on other people’s podcasts I always find new ways to say the things I want to express, new ways to say what I’ve learned from my guests and my experiences. Who better to interview me than the person who has been interviewing me for almost a dozen years. “I came prepared,” she told me. Because she wanted to find out what you don’t see on Google...</p> <p>Here’s what we talked about:</p> <p>The rise of entrepreneurship and the rise of “gurus.” Farnoosh asked me, “Who should people trust?” But really, it doesn’t matter. Anytime you “study” entrepreneurship, it means you’re not DOING entrepreneurship. It’s great to have ideas. And it’s fine to read one business books (TOPS), but then that’s it. Get in the mud and starting doing. - listen at 7 minutes</p> <p>Farnoosh asked me, “Do you remember the first time you used the internet?”  It was before the web. I logged into a news group and could talk to people from Norway about Star Wars. Besides the phone, it was the first time I spoke to someone without being in the same room…  It was 1986. And then the web started. Hypertext came in. And I thought it would be used for storytelling. But then it became huge for commerce. Then she asked me, “What’s next?” - listen at 19 minutes</p> <p>Mentorship and finding your inner circle - listen at 25 minutes</p> <p>Evolution, willpower and the access economy - listen at 36 minutes</p> <p>My daily schedule (the morning is my “maker” hours, in the evening I manage several businesses and at night I have fun. I do comedy.) - listen at 38 minutes</p> <p>Is it better to focus on one thing and enjoy the subtleties of what it takes to be the best in the world at something? Or diversify? I struggle with this. Farnoosh said she bought the book, “The One Thing.” Because she wanted to get focussed. “I bought it and never finished it,” she said. The irony… she got busy doing “other” things. But maybe the other things takes us off our path, out of our delusions and shift us into doing more fulfilling learning curves. - listen at 43 minutes</p> <p>The story of “lucky Lisa.” That’s Farnoosh’s nickname for the friend who helped me get rid of all of my belongings - listen at 53 minutes</p> <p>“What about dating?” Farnoosh wondered if dating is weird for me. Because I have no home. And then we talked about renting vs owning. I used to believe in renting. But now I just borrow. It’s part of the new access economy. We live in a world of access (and Airbnb). But I eventually answer her question about dating, too. - listen at 59 minutes</p> <p>Then we talked about money. “If you couldn’t pass on any money to your kids and all you could pass on was investment strategies, rules, a portfolio, what would it be?” - listen at 1 hour and 5 minutes</p> <p>“Do you like talking about politics?” she asked… - listen at 1 hour and 10 minutes</p> <p>“Did you vote?” No. And I don’t think it matters. Here’s why. Saying it’s your “civil responsibility” to vote is not true. I agree we all have a civil duty. I do mine by writing 300 articles a year, giving talks, doing 100 podcasts a year and giving it all away. You get to decide how you fulfil your this civil duty. If you choose voting, that’s fine. But I don’t. I don’t want to outsource my contribution. We started debating - listen at 1 hour and 11 minutes</p> <p>Hear the story of the time I went to Bernie Madoff and was turned away. He said, “The last thing I need is to see the name Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC on the front page of the Wall Street Journal” - listen at 1 hour and 19 minutes</p> <p>How to get into TV - listen at 1 hour and 22 minutes</p> <p>AND the “choose yourself” method for getting into TV (how to get past the gatekeepers) - listen at 1 hour and 27 minutes</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>“Have a spirit of adventure, the desire to learn something new, be an explorer and never get too comfortable.”</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>-------</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Imagine this room is filling up with poisonous gas,” Tim said. He’s looking straight at me. “There’s two doors behind me, one window and one to either side.” He points exactly where everything is, even though he’s still looking straight at me.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have several choices,” he said, “I can pick the locks of one of the doors. I can break down the doors. I can smash one of the windows and we can climb out. We have three minutes until we die. What do we do?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim is aware of everything around him. Which is probably why I started off the podcast with:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have nothing in common.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re 30 seconds into the interview and we’re already disagreeing,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a creative challenge to figure out how to relate with each person I meet… He’s a US Army Special Forces sniper. He’s been to Iraq and Afghanistan. He’s an MMA fighter. And has multiple black belts.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have zero black belts. I have negative black belts. I haven’t been to war. And I’m not trained to kill people. I can’t shove someone without looking funny.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we have different instincts.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember every moment of every gunfight I’ve ever been in,” he said. “And there are things that wake me up at night.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like what?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the movies, saving your friends and killing a bad guy is a high-five moment, right? No. You just took a human life. That is something that echoes with you through eternity.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told me about the decisions he had to make every day. And how his dad’s words rang in the back of his head, “Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four people in Tim’s unit. Each had a different job: communications, medicine, explosives, tactics. Tim was tactics. “Weapons tactic expert,” that was his job title.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He constantly had to assess whether or not to fire. Because the situation was never clear. Innocent people could be in the same room as the man with the machine gun.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was shooting at my teammates. He had a machine gun in the window.” And Tim didn’t know what (or who else) was on the other side...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he asked me, “Do you throw the grenade?”</span> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know. My instinct is to run.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Run? The bullets are 175 grain and travel at 2,800 feet per second. Do you run 2,800 feet per second?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He threw the grenade.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did you ever find out what was behind that window?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah... the moment the grenade goes off and all you hear are women and children screaming and crying. I stayed up for a week with the women and kids that were in that room. We fight until the fight is over. But then we revisit and give them the best medical care that we can in the field and transport them to the best hospitals that we have access to. That’s the most beautiful thing about US Army Special Forces, ‘The Green Berets.’ We want to do everything</span> by, with <span style= "font-weight: 400;">and</span> through <span style= "font-weight: 400;">the indigenous people.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t imagine.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And not being able to imagine, is what we have in common. It’s when you try to find the bridge where two people can meet that I learn the most about the people around me.</span></p> <p> Here's what we talked about...</p> <p> </p> <p>Shortcuts: -</p> <p>[12:20] <strong>-</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked about his childhood. I wanted to know if fighting is inherent. He says it wasn’t. Although, he did learn how to fight when he was young. His brother and friends always threw him in the pool. “Were you traumatized?” I asked. Tim had the mindset that he could get stronger. And he planned to throw them in the pool someday. All 9 of them. But in between sports and horsing around, Tim’s Mom brought in balance. She enrolled him in piano lessons. I didn’t ask if he still plays piano. I don’t know if he still has this balance. But it’s worthwhile to try to create it in your own life. To lose your stresses in the concentration of a new art, a new practice.</span></p> <p>[27:12] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- “War is horrible. Period. It’s where we see the most unimaginable horrors,” Tim said. So I asked him why he initially signed up to go to war. And He told me this, “Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing.” He had to take action. I asked him another question. This is happening all over the world. We didn’t take action in Rwanda until it was too late. At what point do you start to take action against evil?   </span></p> <p>[39:20] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- Tim’s made mistakes. Mistakes that wake him up at night or prevent him from going to sleep. War takes a toll. He set up a scenario for me. A machine gun being stuck out a window, pointed at him and his team. Shooting. He throws a grenade through the window the machine gun is in. The grenade goes off. The moment it goes off he can hear the women and children screaming and crying. He had no idea who was in the building, but does he risk his own life to save the lives of the women and children inside? Listen for what happens after the smoke clears.  </span></p> <p>[49:00] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- “You don’t get to see who a person really is, until you strip them down,” Tim said. He’s talking about the Army Special Forces selection process. It’s one month of breaking the candidates down before the real training even begins. You don’t have a name. Just a number. You have no identity, no resume. They deprive you of sleep and your calorie intake is substantially inadequate. Then they find out who you really are at your core...</span></p> <p>[53:00] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- Tim said, “Once you understand humanity, you understand right and wrong, you understand just and unjust. These are things that transcend language”. Tim was an expert at transcending language. It was part of his job. Because he had to adapt and assimilate into cultures around the world. So I asked him, “What are the tools? How do you became a “warrior ambassador?”</span></p> <p>[58:00] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- I didn’t realize how much our army gets involved in all the world’s issues. They stop poachers, save animals from going endangered, they try to stop human trafficking and anything that touches the black market. I wanted to learn more about human trafficking .I know it’s a very real problem in the world, but I didn’t know enough. What does it mean? Are little girls being kidnapped and sold into slavery? And does that happen all over the place? “Yes,” Tim said, “It happens here in the United States, here in Austin, TX.” Then he told me how this black market industry is supporting terrorism all over the world.  Listen here for Tim’s explanation of how we are trying to put it to an end.</span></p> <p>[1:08:50] <span style="font-weight: 400;">- I asked Tim about mastery. He’s a peak performer in all areas of combat and martial arts. He also owns several businesses. So I asked, “How did you master all of these areas?”  But he said, “There’s no such thing as mastery.” So I asked him what he thinks of learning. He told me this, “Have a spirit of adventure, the desire to learn something new, be an explorer and never get too comfortable.” Listen to our conversation to learn Tim’s perspective on how to regain your sense of exploration.</span></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

And half the time about this:</p> <p>[14:00] - Charlie’s time working for Tim Ferriss, doing a virtual internship with Seth Godin, and marketing Ramit Sethi’s New York Times bestseller.

It’s up to you to move toward your dreams. Charlie said, “You’re brought into school where your spontaneity and impulses are muted.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You have five minutes to kill. That’s it. Those five minutes can make or break a career.</p> <p>I don’t think I would be able to handle the pressure. I’ve done a lot of public speaking. And now I’ve tried standup. For the past three months I’ve been going up once or twice a week.</p> <p>It’s difficult.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was afraid before interviewing Jocko. I think it was instinctual. His body is seven times the size of mine. I pointed at the cover of his new book, “The Way of The Warrior Kid.</p> <p>“See this kid,” I said. “That’s me right now.”</p> <p>I like to overlap somewhere with my guest. Like a story we both can share and laugh about.</p> <p>With Jim Norton, for instance, we grew up together. With Garry Kasparov we were both chess players. And I also worked on Deep Blue for a while, the computer that would ultimately defeat him.</p> <p>But with Jocko…what? I felt intimidated. He was like this superhero that had conquered the world and everyone respected him and I felt like the nerdy little boy I was in junior high school.</p> <p>So I started talking. “I can’t do a pull up. And I’ve never been in the battlefield… obviously. Or I would look completely different. You were the commander of your SEAL unit and you had to make life and death decisions. But out of that, you cultivated all of these leadership lessons.”</p> <p>He listened. That was nice. Then I asked why he joined the military. (And stayed for 20 years.) But he flipped the question back to me. (He has a podcast, too. So he knows how to drive an interview.)</p> <p>“Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted to be in combat,” he said.</p> <p>“Why?”</p> <p>“Well… what did you want to do when you were growing up?” he asked.</p> <p>“I guess I wanted to write and interview people.”</p> <p>“Well, there you go.”</p> <p>I don’t think my brain fully realizes that I’m doing what I dreamt of doing as a kid. Jocko made it sound so simple.</p> <p>“Well, there you go.”</p> <p>We’re not all lucky with everything we do. Jocko is lucky. I am lucky. But some of his friends didn’t make it back from war.</p> <p>Doing is the step forward.

			<title>Ep. 231 - Jim Norton: Dropout and Laugh (A Comedian's Journey)</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Norton is the reason why I do podcasts. First, he’s a world-famous comedian, recently released a one hour special on Netflix, has been on shows like “Louie” and “Inside Amy Schumer” has written two New York Times bestselling books and has appeared on countless radio shows and podcasts.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">But just as interesting to me...we grew up together. The first day Jim moved  into town we were in fourth grade. Rather than keeping his mouth shut like  anyone else just moving into town he immediately started making everyone laugh. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Day one we were laughing so hard I thought my stomach was going to break. We all said out loud that day (Jim doesn’t remember but I do), “you should be a comedian”. And he did. He did! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like when my podcast combines the personal and the professional. Combines my own story with the story of someone achieving peak performance in an area of life that I love. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Comedy is not just about making people laugh. And being a standup comedian is not just about “standing up” in front of a crowd of people and telling jokes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy is about observing the hidden truths in life that everyone knows but nobody has ever quite articulated. And standup is about how to articulate that truth in such a way that people feel momentarily unsafe and confused (the setup), and relieved (the punchline). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s only one theory of comedy. There are many. And so I wanted to try it for myself. I’ve been doing it now a few times a week for two months. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard! It’s the most difficult thing I’ve ever tried to get good at. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked Jim, who has been doing it all of his life,  to come on the podcast. Here are some things I learned:</span></p> <p>Make Mistakes <strong>-</strong> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">listen at [8:08]</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told Jim I was afraid to bomb. To tell a joke and have nobody laugh.</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">“Bombing is what we learn from the most,” Jim said. “It’s not about how to avoid bombing. You will fall flat all the time. It’s about getting up after that.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I left myself no safety net,” he said. “I started when I was 21. I didn’t have a diploma. I got a GED three years after I got sober. I have no high school diploma... So I knew it was going to be this or nothing.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes to survive the biggest pains on the way up, you have to fly without a safety net. You have to fall. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The way to hit the top tier in any area of life is to figure out where the line is, and go beyond that line. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you aren’t failing, then you aren’t trying to be unique. You aren’t going to be the top tier.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find Time to Laugh at Yourself -</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">listen at [14:45]</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy is about connection. You tell something about your life, something honest and true and usually uncomfortable. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">The comedians job is to transform your pain. Like an alchemist. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I make fun of myself,” Jim said. “I give my own personal examples, but I think if I’m doing that at least I’m being truthful and I’m not coming from a place of thinking I’m better than that guy… like who am I?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They laugh because it’s a safe way for people to experience their own demons. You can get close enough to the shadows of your life without the fear of being overrun by guilt or shame. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance for us all to be a little more human, a little more honest and a little more free.</span></p> <p>The Umbrella Theory<strong>  </strong><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">-</span></em> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">listen at [28:50]</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim just started writing another book. He’s on TV. He’s touring. He’s got a radio show (Jim Norton and Sam Roberts on Sirius), he has a podcast. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He works with incredible talent. And is always looking for new material from his own life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t just be lazy,” he said. “I talked to Chris Rock recently and I know it sounds like I’m name dropping, but I’m not. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a total name drop,” I said. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">“But I didn’t mean it like that…” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked about Chris Rock’s career. He stopped touring. He hadn’t been on the road for seven years. But yet you still hear his name all the time. He’s hosting the Oscars, testing out material at clubs, etc. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To succeed in any area, right now list all the things that are skills in that area. Make sure you spend some time trying to master all the granular parts of the field you want to be unique in. The ones who master the “umbrella” of their field are the winners.</span>  </p> <p>Is Your Heart In It? <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">-</span></em> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">listen at [1:06:40]</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m going on stage once or twice a week now. I’d love if you come. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, the audience doesn’t know me. It’s hard to set that foundation. I want us to all be in it together. I asked Jim what three things should I do?</span></p> <ol> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write material everyday</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tape your set you do and make yourself watch it</span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get on stage every night (or as much as humanly possible where you know your hearts really in it) / be willing to show up</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number three is true for any dream…</span></p> <p>Catch the Cycles of Comparison <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">-</span></em> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">listen at [46:15]</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have a solution to every problem in my life. I think that’s why I’m still writing… seven years after starting this blog, I’m still confessing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim and I talked about comparing ourselves. I make this mistake daily. I look around and see who’s on the front-page of my dreams today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I always want to achieve what I'm not achieving,” Jim said. "I never feel like I'm doing well." </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think everyone has a tendency to wonder, “what’s next”. This is sort of the problem with goals. You achieve a goal and it always seems anticlimactic  because now you have to work towards the next goal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ask myself this because since 2003 I’ve written 18 books. I’ve done at least one, sometimes two books, every year since 2003. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now. This is the first year I’m not working on a new book. I haven’t felt the urge so I won’t force it. But I have felt the desire to get better at other things and achieve other things so rather that keep to the routine of writing another book, I’m trying to achieve success in these other areas.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">---</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Jim and I went to school from ages 10 to 18, I hadn’t seen him in 31 years until he walked into the podcast studio. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">What a pleasure to combine the deeply personal with my professional passions. The result is always so much better as well. Because we have the story and the rapport, and we can get right down to learning the topic I love best: how to achieve peak performance in any area of life. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">But seeing a friend for the first time in 31 years.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOW TO DISCOVER THE SECRETS IN LIFE</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best things in life are born from coincidence. I am a firm believer in this.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year ago I was flying back from California. I started talking to the guy sitting next to me. Turns out he had  worked in almost every branch of government related to intelligence and diplomacy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now he runs his own private intelligence company. He has information about every government in the world. He is paid a lot of money to reveal and analyze that information.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when we were on the plane, for basically four or five hours I asked him everything I could and got the most incredible detail about the state of affairs in the world. I’m almost afraid to reveal what we spoke about on the plane.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Everything from “how to catch a liar” to “What is the Nigerian government specifically doing about oil prices” to “Will Trump win?” (and his answer turned out to be stunningly accurate).</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then...a lost touch with him. He  was just a guy I sat next to on the plane for a few hours. We got off and went to live our separate lives.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until now.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His new book is out: “Warnings” written with uber-diplomat Richard Clarke.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is he warning about? Everything.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where are the hidden potential catastrophes around the world. And how can we live with them. And how can we avoid them. And how can we figure out the warnings after these?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He answers, he analyzes, he proves, and he does it from his 30 years of experience uncovering these things for the US government and now, through his company, for other governments and large institutions that can afford him.</span> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is: “that  can afford him”. Because now he comes on the podcast and just like the coincidence of meeting  him a year ago, he answers all of my questions again about his book. About the “Warnings”.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love  when coincidence intersects real life. I saw his book, remembered him from our interaction, and we had the best time on the podcast. Read the book, listen to the podcast, and don’t ignore the coincidences in your life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(But he is.)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R.P. Eddy is the CEO or Ergo, one of the greatest super intelligent firms in the world. Governments hire him and his firm to spy on other governments.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hopefully, I wasn’t too indiscreet,” he said, referring to the time on his plane.</span>  </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told him not to worry. “If you’re not arrested by the end of this podcast, then you’re okay.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his book, “Warnings: Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes,” R.P. covers all the major world catastrophes that could’ve been predicted and prevented: 9/11, Madoff, Fukushima, the financial crisis, AIDS, climate change.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can learn to predict these, or at least learn how to figure out  how the correct experts are, then a lot of pain can be avoided.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts warned us. But no one listened to them. R.P. calls these people “Cassandras.” The name comes from greek mythology. Apollo (a god) wanted to sleep with Cassandra. She refused. So Apollo cursed her.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She could foretell any future disaster. She could see it in vivid color,” R.P said. But the curse was that no one believed her. So she burned to death in a terrible attack. (An attack she knew was coming…)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These people exist in real life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And R.P. wants us to notice them. So R.P, and his coauthor, Richard Clarke, started “The Annual Cassandra Award.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re giving away cash prizes (up to $10,000) to motivate people to find and nominate a true “Cassandras.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the formula for spotting a “Cassandra…”</span></p> <p>How to detect a truth-teller <span style= "font-weight: 400;">(listen at [55:25</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">])</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Cassandras” featured in R.P’s book are experts in their field. They have been for years. He told me about Laurie Garrett, the head of global health for the Council of Foreign Relations. She’s the first person to ever win the Polk, the Pulitzer and the Peabody.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She foresaw the rise of HIV/AIDS when she was a radio reporter in San Francisco,” R.P. said. “She saw these men dying of a disease called ‘gay related immune deficiency,’ ‘GRID,’ or ‘gay cancer.’ They didn’t know what it was. Gay men didn’t think they had a transmissible disease. They thought they were sharing a cancer somehow, but just by looking at them and seeing the Kaposi sarcoma on their face, Laurie Garrett knew this was a contagious illness and started getting the media to pay attention.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was during the time of Ryan White. He was a young, poor high school student dying of HIV caused by a blood transfusion.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was banned from school. People shot at his house. “Noted politicians called for gay people to be put in camps,” R.P. said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Laurie could see how the pandemic was unfolding. And she came up with a plan for health care and surveillance networks to prevent the disease’s spread.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue is that a lot of “Cassandras” are ignored. Because sometimes warnings are wrong… so how do you tell the difference between a “chicken little" and a “Cassandra.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cassandras” are data driven. “Everybody in our book who was right was a proven, technical expert on the topic they were speaking about,” R.P. said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are questioners by personality.” They ask hard questions and doubt what most believe.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have an off-putting personality (not always, but it’s common).</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have a sense of personal responsibility. “When they walk into a restaurant and the fire alarm goes off, they’re the one who says to everybody, ‘Let’s get out of here,” R.P. Said. “These guys think of themselves as sheepdogs. Some people think of themselves as sheep (they probably don’t realize they’re sheep) and then we all know there are wolves out there. Sheepdogs, to some extent, think it’s their job to protect us.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have high anxiety. “Let’s go back to our fire alarm example. These are the guys who look for the fire exits when they walk in. They’re the people who pull the fire alarm when they smell smoke. And when you think about personalities, a lot of people don’t do that.”</span></p> <p>Why we continue to let real threats slip by us:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked R.P. why these people, “the Cassandras,” are ignored. Why aren't we trying harder to prevent terrible things from happening?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It comes down to our human biases,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pick sides.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we think someone is off-putting, we doubt them. If they confuse us (meaning they’re data goes over our head), we move on. And miss the warning.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same is true for our ideologies and belief systems. We’re quick to deny people who think differently. Madoff’s ponzi scheme is a perfect example.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">R.P. interviewed Harry Markopolos, a financial fraud investigator. “He knew within 45 seconds of understanding Madoff’s “hedge-fund” that it was a ponzi scheme,” R.P said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the SEC didn’t listen to Harry’s warning because of his personality. They thought he was obnoxious.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though he had hard evidence:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Madoff claimed to trade 60 billion dollars worth of options. But that many options didn’t even exist in market. The math proves Harry right.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans fail by emotions.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if there’s a solution. Maybe we have to unlearn. Maybe we have to judge our judgements.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And ask more questions.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curiosity is a new world. And isn’t that what we want after all?</span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His platoon was counting on him. He couldn’t come back a failure. Brandon had been deployed to the Middle East four times. He’d seen the ugliness and destruction war had caused. And now he was being sent straight to sniper school. This is one of the most stressful jobs as a Navy SEAL. He would have to learn how to make quick decisions. Hard decisions.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only easy day was yesterday,” he said. “That's our motto.” Brandon is one of the most accomplished sniper teachers of his time. He changed the system. And implemented positive reinforcement, which allowed him to see firsthand how having a good “mental mindset” propels people into success.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his memoir, “The Red Circle” and his newest book, a</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">bestseller “The Killing School: Inside the World’s Deadliest Sniper Program,” Brandon shows you exactly how to train for a “champions mindset.” He uses mental management strategies: visualization, positive self-talk, solution-based thinking and so on.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is the master of his own fate.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now you can be too...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">--</span></p> <p>Here's what we talk about:</p> <p><strong>[6:08]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- I don't normally do this. But this time I gave away the “table of contents” of what I wanted to discuss with Brandon Webb:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- I wanted to cover Brandon’s ideas on war</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- discuss the issue of teaching people to kill people (to me, this is the elephant in the room)</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Brandon was one of the first deployed to Iraq. So I wanted to ask about his ups and downs going to war, coming back and going to war again</span></p> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">-“Obviously, I don’t want to learn how to be a sniper” I said, “but what I really want to talk about is peak performance.” Both of Brandon's books to talk about this, especially his section on “mental management.” I wanted to learn what tools and habits I need to do today to make myself a master of my own fate. That’s essentially what this show is about… becoming the master of your own fate. “Choosing yourself.”</span></p> <p><strong>[30:16]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- I needed to know. Islam itself. What is the fight? Is this really a fight of religions? I asked Brandon why radicalism has spread so quickly in the Middle East. He pointed out the economics and the gap between rich and poor. “The social and political situation is not very good… Saudi Arabia, for example, has a very elite royal ruling class but the working population is very poor.” He said people join the fight because they need a cause. They need to belong to something. A military is a tribe. I get this question all the time. “How do I find my purpose?” Some people find their purpose in a fight. In a mission. In a cause… Brandon explained that the people who join these radical groups, or any group, were probably suffering in life. And they wanted to fill a hole in their life. They wanted what any human wants: a feeling of belonging. That’s the powerful force pulling them in. When Brandon was 16, his dad threw him off a boat in Tahiti. Brandon had to find his way back. And eventually he joined the military, became a Navy SEAL and then became a special ops sniper. There were 23 of them and 220 tried out. The question he gets most often is one of ignorance, “How many people did you kill?” But that's not what it's about for Brandon. And maybe that's what separates good from evil. He continued to tell me how radical governments incentives people to join “the cause.” He said they pay you to become a martyr. I couldn't believe it. “Is that true?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said, “As a state sponsor of terror, Iran is funding and fueling the conflict in the Middle East, especially with Israel.” And the Internet makes it worse, too. Brandon tells me how...</span></p> <p><strong>[59:03]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- Brandon was training people to be peak performers in incredibly high stake situations. It wasn’t just target practice. Someone would be shooting back. He expected each and every one of his students to perform at a perfect level. Eighty and ninety percent was no longer acceptable. I wondered how you could teach someone to perform under these high standards. The key: visualization.</span></p> <p><strong>[1:02:30]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- “I’ve seen it,” Brandon says, “I’ve seen it while on the firing line. They think about it and then it transfers to behavior.” If someone says don’t flinch, they’re going to flinch. Brandon made up the ranks. His job was to train snipers. And he wanted to start by programming his students with good habits. So instead of focusing on the negative (don't flinch), he focused on the positive (keep your eyes on the target.)</span></p> <p><strong>[1:03:52]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- “I’ve always been pretty good at math,” Brandon says, but once he started his own business he started to doubt himself. The financial statements were too hard, he was no good at it. He started thinking he “can't”, but he caught himself. And change his self talk. Listen to how he did this in our interview. You’ll also hear how to create the narrative necessary to support it.  </span></p> <p><strong>[1:07:26]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">- Brandon left the Navy. And started his own company. But he didn't know when to let go. It wasn't working out. He lost everything. A month later his wife was asking for a divorce. And the kids went with her. “I had to have the conversation with all his neighbors: “Where'd your family go?" It was embarrassing. He said it was the first time he felt like he really failed in life. I asked how he bounced back. He told me this: “Failure is necessary to being successful in life. There's a big difference between quitting and failure.”</span></p> <p><strong>[1:17:14]</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;">-We we're talking about gold medalists. And how they have a different mindset. He told me some of the expectations he holds for himself. And how you can create “the mind of a champion” with visualization tactics, hard work and confidence. (He also tells me how someone even gets confidence to begin with.)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">--</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if you like today’s show, subscribe!

The financial statements were too hard, he was no good at it. He started thinking he “can't”, but he caught himself. And change his self talk. Listen to how he did this in our interview. You’ll also hear how to create the narrative necessary to support it.  </p> <p>[1:07:26] - Brandon left the Navy. And started his own company. But he didn't know when to let go. It wasn't working out. He lost everything. A month later his wife was asking for a divorce. And the kids went with her. “I had to have the conversation with all his neighbors: “Where'd your family go?" It was embarrassing. He said it was the first time he felt like he really failed in life. I asked how he bounced back. He told me this: “Failure is necessary to being successful in life. There's a big difference between quitting and failure.”</p> <p>[1:17:14] -We we're talking about gold medalists. And how they have a different mindset. He told me some of the expectations he holds for himself. And how you can create “the mind of a champion” with visualization tactics, hard work and confidence. (He also tells me how someone even gets confidence to begin with.)</p> <p>--</p> <p>Also, if you like today’s show, subscribe!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I almost changed forever the entire way people define relationships. The word "commitment" would have a new meaning. More babies would be born.</p> <p>I'm thinking BIG.</p> <p>Sometimes you want to try an idea and you don't let yourself think about money.</p> <p>If an idea is good, money is a side effect. Ideas are the real currency.</p> <p>I met a brand new couple for breakfast. J and K. They told me they just had the "going steady" conversation.</p> <p>"How'd you guys meet?"</p> <p>"J-Swipe". Or something like that. I forget. It was an online dating app.</p> <p>"What does 'going steady' mean when you are both in your 40s?" I asked.</p> <p>J was in his 40s. K wasn't. I wondered if 'going steady' meant that he gave her a ring or something. There's only so many more 'going steady's you have left in you at that age.</p> <p>They both pulled out their phones. They were looking at each other's phone and then showing me.</p> <p>"We deleted all of the dating apps on our phone," she said. But they were both peering at each other's firm.</p> <p>They needed confirmation.</p> <p>Hmmmm!</p> <p>Idea:</p> <p>The "Going Steady" App</p> <p>Both sides of the couple sign in to the app. Then they select the other person. Then when both sides select each other, the app deletes all the dating apps on their phone.</p> <p>If they ever download a dating app again, the other side gets notified by email. Or if they "de-select" each other from "Going Steady" then both sides get notified by email.</p> <p>Simple!</p> <p>Extras:</p> <p>- Notify FB and Twitter that they are "Going Steady"<br /> - Keep track of anniversaries, gifts, places they go, significant memories, etc.<br /> - Notify friends of anniversaries, etc.</p> <p>BOOM!</p> <p>The next day I wrote up the "spec", which was actually just similar to what I wrote above.</p> <p>I logged into <a href= "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Ffreelancer.com%2F&h=ATOlLxcjbvZu6yQ9zf6tc8SFgpRvu9RjnyYwt4gNqcxYC33Nr5SIRj1P7uPhSb_RFpOSWt9k9au99DUEuzZRWo3dgHhzHfR_RmToeC4G6JFuN5YWp6ZdhlM3OmYJ2QcDZLucT1_KyyDCjUaxVmtdIZE&enc=AZMiS4Kgp_m-2aN_4Sq-KJ2PsfFdyA6R6OQfZ1UEqfkEXqyxwuv6lJHjFXdEHba5zjR_ahZvveGPLJrdc7V4rdbrsCDhQ8ds_A_OOP17YyP2veWddJHmPaSdPCqQjaEMJUT6GymoeJwy-2xXXI_54CLZ2NG_k9KjYDdE4VjNMvo85rvshy3g7aRiBv4kpUFydYc&s=1" target="_blank" rel= "nofollow noopener noreferrer">freelancer.com.</a> I opened a new project and cut and pasted my Spec in there.</p> <p>It was weird to read prior chats I had had on the site.

I chatted with each one of them to make sure they understood what I was asking.</p> <p>My basic test was this question: can an app on Android and Apple detect and delete other apps on Android and Apple?</p> <p>The customer service representative recommended a developer as well. This developer cost more than $1000. More like $3500. That's ok. I just wanted a good job done.</p> <p>A small price to pay to change the future of evolution.</p> <p>I asked this developer the same question.</p> <p>Some of the developers would not upload to the stores or do any marketing. I crossed them off.</p> <p>Others didn't seem to understand my question about detecting other apps on the phone. I crossed them out. I didn't want any communication problems with people from the opposite side of the world.</p> <p>Finally, the recommended developer said, "I know you can do this on Android but not sure on Apple. Let me research."</p> <p>Five minutes later he came back. "It's impossible to do this on Apple."</p> <p>We tried to figure out a work-around.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortcuts - </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[5:40] - I asked Garry, “What separated you from people just as talented?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He interrupted. Finally! I found my match! “Wait, wait wait, slow down,” he said. “‘</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">As talented’</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is a stretch.” </span>He said he was lucky. His upbringing made him a champion. “I was born in a family where chess was part of the culture. My father and mother usually spent their winter nights looking at the newspaper chess sections, solving problems. Also, I was born in the Soviet Union so when my talent was discovered, I had an opportunity to be taught by semi-professionals. Then professionals. The framework for my talent to be discovered and to be polished was there.” He said, “You may call that luck, but the talent was quite unique.” That’s how you become a peak performer. You have to pursue your talent and get a little lucky. But it’s never just luck. “As soon as I discovered chess I started moving very quickly.” He beat the kids his own age and older. By age 12 he was the Soviet junior champion. Peak performance comes from talent, luck and an ability to move up in the ranks faster than your competition. How do you do that?</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[11:44] - I feel like I’m always trying to figure out my life. I’m always planning. Because I think if I subtract X from my life, add Y, and multiply by 100, I’ll be happy. </span>Garry told me how he takes a step back. He said you need to see the big picture. That’s why he started drawing all his chess matches. After each game, Garry drew the board, he looked at what happened and he saw where he went wrong. “I could feel at at every game, I was getting better,” Garry said. “I was learning.” That’s why I write everyday. It takes my mind out of the equation. I get to see what I’m doing. And how my life is. I stop making moves. And I just breathe. Then I see clearly. <span style= "font-weight: 400;">The key is to create a ritual of reflection. Writing, drawing. Do something that let’s you see the board. See your life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[27:40] - Sometimes Garry had ten steps planned out. Other times, nothing. </span>Garry said, “In the cases where you don’t have a clear preference, go with your natural instinct.” </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[34:55] - Garry was beat by Deep Blue, IMB’s “genius” computer. It was the first time a machine beat the human brain at chess. </span>People said it was a revelation. And the end was near. The same thing happened when ATM’s were invented. Everyone thought bank tellers were going away. .And before that the elevator operator was eliminated. People went on strike. “This is a normal development of technology,” Garry said. “If you have something really disruptive, it means it kills jobs before it creates new jobs.” Sometimes jobs are replaced. Sometimes they’re not. As humans our biggest shortcoming is that we let our fear precede any real threat. Machines don’t have fear. But they also don’t have the ability to dream… “We all do have fears,” Garry said. “The question is how do we handle it… I want people to not be afraid of this progress because there are so many things we can bring back if we start dreaming again. By the way machines cannot dream. Even in sleeping mode.” </p> <p>--</p> <p class="p1">Also, if you like today’s show, subscribe!

If he earned a decent income, Jon would lose his Medicaid.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His reputation as a writer grew. So he started consulting. And made 30,000 dollars in 24 hours. “At first, I charged $99. And 300 people signed up.” He raised his prices. Then built online courses that taught people how to guest-blog and started another “premium” consulting service.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I made half a million dollars in 9 months,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work lets him pay his own health benefits and live life for himself.

His story continues to inspire thousands around the world.</span></p> <p>Shortcuts - </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[23:00] - Jon told me how he developed a sense of self worth. Hear how he did it. -</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[26:25] - “When I got into kindergarten, another kid called me disabled, and I said, ‘What does that mean?’ And, he started laughing.” Jon’s teacher came over and said, “You don't know what that means?” He didn’t. So he asked his mom. She thought about it and said, “It means you can't do something as well as someone else. But it also goes the other way.” She said, “Everyone in the world can't do something as well as someone else…” So everyone in a sense is disabled. Jon focussed took inventory of his skills. Then he mastered them.

But he couldn’t accept any of them.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He had to keep his medicaid. And if he exceeded $700 per month, the government would take it away. So he found</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a loophole.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He worked for free.

He needed to reconstruct his reality. “I can only move my facial muscles,” he said. He would’ve went crazy. But he made a new plan. <span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started listening to audiobooks and podcasts 4-8 hours a day.” His goal was to spend more time listening to inspirational stories, than he actually spent in his own life.</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">I needed to understand,</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">“Why was that your goal?”</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">He said,</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">“If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that started to seem normal to me.” Listen how Jon reconstructed his reality -</span></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[1:16:20] - </span>Jon said, “A lot of people are under the assumption they can get whatever they want without trading something that they have.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember sitting at my cubicle job looking at people wondering, “Why? Why are you here? Why are you doing this?” I asked a friend once, “Don’t you think this job is meaningless?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then I knew what I had to do. I had to quit. And I did (eventually). First I spent time building up my own business on the side.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if I’ve ever really believed in myself. I just knew I didn’t want the life I had. Sometimes believing in yourself just means you don’t believe in what you’re doing right now. And you have to change.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Blakey felt this way, too. She woke up one day, looked at her life and said, “I’m in the wrong movie.” Now she’s a self-made billionaire entrepreneur.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my friend Ryan Deiss said believing in yourself is possible. And I wanted to know more.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He started his first business in college. And made $100K in revenue the first year. He sold eBooks online. “I had books on pretty much any topic,” he said. One was about baby food. Then he partnered with mommy bloggers and sold it to their readers. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(That’s the formula for a great strategic partnership. Create something useful. Find someone with an untapped audience. Someone who’s talking to the people you want to talk to but who isn’t not offering what you have to offer.)</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, years later, he’s the founder and CEO of DigitalMarketer. He’s a transformer. He teaches people how to build profitable online businesses.  </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He walked me through it. He told me about digital marketing.

He's the founder and CEO of DigitalMarketer and anybody in the internet marketing space knows Ryan Deiss.</p> <p>He emailed me at 4am. He said, "I realized the promise that was made to millenials-- the same one that was made to me, and probably the same one that was made to you-- “Go to college. You’ll get a good job," simply isn’t true anymore." </p> <p>The old promise is no longer true. But there’s a new promise….</p> <p>We're going back to a society where mastery matters. And grades don't. </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But still....most parents want to send their kids to college. Have them waste the four years, and even the money. Get into debt. “It will pay off,” they think, even though the data shows incomes for people ages 18-35 have been going straight down for 25 years.</span></p> <p>So how do you grow?

I met my wife in college. I’m thankful for that, but I think to call your first couple of years college the place where you learn to be an adult is mildly absurd.” </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- [17:45] - Ryan told me the top two things he looks for when hiring a candidate... and it's not a college degree.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- [18:07] - Learn how to add value and move up in any job.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">- [25:18] - </span>Ryan has four kids. Sending them to college would cost over a million dollars. But he said he would do it. But he has a few conditions: they have to get a job or internship. They need to test the market. And see if that’s really the right fit for their lifestyle.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hear Ryan’s advice on how to go through college the right way.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- [28:44] - “I think if we acknowledge that a college degree is not a prerequisite to success or happiness in life than we will not as parents, or as kids, or as educators, or as employers, determine that it is a necessary requirement,” Ryan said.

And discovers innovative ways to live longer, lose weight, increase brain function and evolve better. My brain isn’t hacked (yet). So I needed to talk to Dave. We did a podcast and I asked him “how do you evolve better?”</p> <p>Shortcuts:</p> <p>- [14:00] - Energy is scarce. We get tired. So I asked Dave what he does specifically to enhance his energy levels?</p> <p class="p2">- [21:40] - Aging is scary… Dave told me what he takes every day to slow down the aging process. This is importance because the environment is affecting how we age. We live in WIFI dense areas. We’re constantly stressed. Our diets fluctuate and so on. “We call it aging. Over time, your ability to power your body goes down, and that doesn't have to happen. It is within your control to fix it,” he said. “You can tell the battery in your body to recondition itself and you can give it a better power source. Or you can let it slowly grind down…”</p> <p class="p2">- [39:50] - I never know what to eat. Once time I went on an all fruit diet. Another time I fasted for three days and passed out while playing ping pong with friends. Dave told me what to eat and what to avoid. He even told me which foods are worse than cigarettes.</p> <p class="p2">- [44:40] - “I like to go all in,” Dave said. He told me exactly what he does from the moment he wakes up.</p> <p class="p2">- [53:00] - I asked Dave, “What do we do to evolve better?”  He told me how to take charge of your body and manage stress.</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p2">-- Hey James here.

And working real-estate for his father wasn’t one of them. “I didn’t want to come down,” he said.</p> <p>“Why’d you do it?”</p> <p>“I really wasn’t happy with myself,” he said. “I believe it was because I wasn’t my authentic self doing what I really wanted to do in my life.”</p> <p>“Nepotism got me the job.”</p> <p>And it was killing him. He was suffocating.</p> <p>Now Scott Steindorff is the producer of “Empire Falls,” “Chef,” (one of my all time favorite movies), “The Lincoln Lawyer,” “Love in the Time of Cholera,” and more.</p> <p>He’s worked with Paul Newman, Jon Favreau, Robert Downey Jr., Matthew McConaughey, Scarlett Johansson, the list goes on.</p> <p>The other day he called me, a few days after we shot the project, to tell me about brand new projects he was working on  that were different than anything he had done before. He is constantly testing the limits of his creativity.</p> <p>I wanted to know how he became his “authentic self.” How did he go from being depressed and self-medicated to a successful and happy movie producer?</p> <p>I wanted to know because I don’t think we ever really know. I think part of self-awareness is never quite getting there but always moving (hopefully) in the right direction. And creativity is something that needs to be  constantly reinvented.</p> <p>Once creativity stays the same, it is no longer creative. Scott found a way to constantly be creativity. I want to learn how.</p> <p>“It’s not easy at all,” he said. “You have to do the leg work.”</p> <p>“What’s the leg work?” I asked</p> <p>Here’s what he said:</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 1: FIND OUT WHAT YOU’RE CRAVING</p> <p>These are the two types of cravings:</p> <p>a) Depletion: Your body needs something. It can be water, a vitamin or mineral or a change. That’s where reinvention comes in.</p> <p>b) Addiction: I felt powerless. I was addicted to money. More was never enough. Then I left Wall Street. Because they were the supplier.</p> <p>Scott wanted euphoria. He craved it.</p> <p>“I grew up wanting to be a skier and an actor and here I was in an office making money,” Scott said. “I started craving that feeling of euphoria and excitement and passion for life.”</p> <p>So he started doing cocaine.</p> <p>“Nobody knew I had a problem,” he said. ” I would do it by myself. So when I checked into rehab, it was a shock to my family.”</p> <p>The patients had to drink some type of alcohol until they threw up. “By the second day, I said to the doctor, ‘This isn’t working for me. I’m a cocaine addict not an alcoholic.”</p> <p>He thought they’d try something new. He thought they’d help.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>“Well… leave,” the doctor said.</p> <p>“There was a shift in my consciousness. I went to my room. I cried uncontrollably for 24 hours. All the stress and pressure left me and from that moment on I haven’t used for almost 33 and a half years.”</p> <p>“What do you mean the stress left you?” I said. I couldn’t imagine. He told me it just left. No explanation. He just saw his own choice. And he took it.</p> <p>I think most people don’t know what they really want in life.</p> <p>We talked about adapting. And I said it seems like you have to surrender and be okay with the changes…  even while you’re depressed.</p> <p>“Isn’t depression a lack of your expression?” he said. I never thought of it that way. Maybe I’m filling one need with sand when I really crave water.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2: ASK QUESTIONS</p> <p>I’m not in a 12-step program, but I want to understand who I am as my authentic self. So I asked what can I do right now?</p> <p>“Ask yourself questions,” he said. “How Am I feeling? How do I feel about myself, do I love myself, am I feeling less than? Do I feel guilt?”</p> <p>“But what if you’re lying to yourself?”</p> <p>“You can’t lie to yourself,” he said. “You’re just denying the truth. If you’re listening to this, it’s coming to the surface. Don’t push it down.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 3: ACT IT OUT</p> <p>It’s easy to come up with ideas. It’s harder to act on them. I always say, actions are more important than words, which are more important than thoughts.</p> <p>It’s not about one skill set. It’s about how you meld them together and act on them.</p> <p>Scott laughed and said, “I have very few skills in life…”</p> <p>I didn’t quite believe him. He had skills to do real estate. To make movies. To be creative. I have skills.</p> <p>But we always compare ourselves to what the “next level” is. And I can’t help it. I do it also. So, again, it’s the direction that counts. And fully engaging in the process.  </p> <p>Scott would surrender. If an opportunity presented itself, and it excited his need for creativity, he would say “yes”.</p> <p>It never hurts to try the next steps in whatever endeavor presents itself. Try it on like you try an outfit to see if you want to wear it for the summer. See if it fits. See if you love it. And if you do, go all in.</p> <p>Scott’s story is not about movies, or addiction, or creativity, it’s about knowing the right direction to take the next step.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 4: MAKE SMALL CHANGES EVERYDAY</p> <p>Scott quit his dad’s real-estate firm.</p> <p>“Was he supportive?” I asked.</p> <p>They didn’t talk for two years…</p> <p>Scott became a millionaire. He was still in real-estate, though. And unhappy. Then the market crashed.</p> <p>“It crushed me,” he said.</p> <p>Scott changed careers every five years or so. Now he’s 56. And he’s working on a Joan of Arc movie, a new TV series based in the Bahamas, and a script for “Station 11.”</p> <p>Any time he liked a book, he’d try to buy the movie rights. Then he’d try to get the movie made. Sometimes it would work. Sometimes it would be a massive success. But always he tried, starting with the simplest step.</p> <p>The story he told me was a combination of luck, learning skills, building a network, and acting on the intersection of all of the above. But more than anything, it’s being open to surrender. Surrendering to constant reinvention.</p> <p>Reinvention is a habit not an event.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I tried to ruin Ryan Holiday’s life. Fortunately, I failed. I told him to start an agency, build it up, sell it for 10 million dollars and THEN start writing books.</p> <p>“It’s a good thing you didn’t listen to me,” I said.</p> <p>But I was wrong. It turned out he took my advice.</p> <p>“It made me super unhappy and it cost me a bunch of friendships,” he said. “But it’s not your fault. I know there are a lot of things that could make me money, but what I really like is writing. That’s what I want my life to be.”</p> <p>“So what if you don’t know what you want your life to be?” I asked. “What should you do?”</p> <p>“That’s the essential question,” he said…</p> <p>A) SELF-WORTH IS NOT NET-WORTH</p> <p>Most writers die penniless. I can’t think of a profession where I can name as many suicides as writing.</p> <p>I’m jealous of the people who don’t write actually. Making business deals and going to work is so much more profitable than trying to tear your soul apart and put words on a piece of paper most people won’t read.</p> <p>There’s only one writer in history to become a billionaire. (J.K. Rowling, if you’re reading… come on my podcast!)</p> <p>So why does anyone do it?</p> <p>I don’t know. I do it because it’s what I would do if I had nothing again. It’s what I would do with everything. It’s the one thing that makes me feel like I am going places without moving.</p> <p>B) VICTIM OR HERO</p> <p>Everyone wants to be the hero of their own story. I do. But I chose victim for years. I lost everything and I wanted the world to pick me back up.</p> <p>I’m not mad at the world for leaving me on the floor. I’m grateful. Because it let me pick myself up. It let me choose myself.</p> <p>“Stoicism is a practical philosophy and it works,” Ryan said.</p> <p>“Define ‘works’.”</p> <p>“At its core, it says you don’t control the world around you. You control how you respond to the world around you.”</p> <p>He told me about the two most prominent practitioners of Stoicism. One was Marcus Aurelius, a Roman emperor. He had all the power in the world. His favorite Stoic was a slave, Epictetus, who was banished from Rome by a past emperor.</p> <p>“You have extreme wealth and power using the philosophy, and it’s helping them,” Ryan said. “And then you have extreme adversity, difficulty and powerlessness using the philosophy and it’s helping them. To me, that’s working.”</p> <p>C) LOOK FORWARD TO THE BAD THINGS</p> <p>People are losing their jobs. And they’re afraid. I asked Ryan if the Stoics have a practice for fear.</p> <p>He said, “The Stoics call that <em>amor fati</em>, which in Latin means ‘a love of fate…’ You look forward to the bad things because they were made just for you.”</p> <p>D) MAKE YOUR JOB IRRELEVANT</p> <p>This is the key to all advancement in life. Make your job irrelevant. Burn the bridges behind you.</p> <p>“You should be trying to make your job or your role irrelevant because what you’re actually proving is that you know how to do things, you know when something is working, and you’re able to come up with the next thing,” Ryan said.</p> <p>“When an employee comes to you and says, ‘I know my job was to run this marketing department, but over the last 6 months I’ve automated X and Y. I’ve hired someone who’s incredibly talented, sales are up X percent and I don’t have that much to do.’ Your boss doesn’t go to <em>their</em> boss and say, ‘Well how do we get rid of James?” They go, “James is f**king killing it.’”</p> <p>“That’s how you work through or up an organization,” he said. “No one says, ‘Your book was so amazing Ryan, we don’t need anymore books from you.’ They go, ‘What are you writing next?’”</p> <p>E) DON’T BE AN ADDICT</p> <p>I was listing the pillars of Stoicism. I wanted to know if I understood.</p> <p>So I said,</p> <p>- Integrity, (universal integrity, for example: never lie to get what you want)</p> <p>- Fairness (Help the people around you. Even if it hurts you. If it helps someone more than it hurts you, it’s just.)</p> <p>Then Ryan jumped in.</p> <p>“Temperance,” he said, which means don’t be an addict to some other force. Don’t be an addict to anything.</p> <p>F) CHOOSE THE APPROVAL YOU WANT</p> <p>“John Kennedy Toole killed himself because his book was rejected. That’s so sad to me because then the book won the pulitzer prize,” Ryan said.</p> <p>I’m always happy when a friend says they like my writing. But I’m exceptionally happy when a complete stranger writes to me and says they like my writing. I don’t know why this is. There’s still a piece of me that craves validation.</p> <p>So I asked Ryan, given that we still want people to like us, how can you be creative or if you don’t like your job, how can you persevere if you’re seeking other people’s approval?</p> <p>He told me how he judges his own success. “I’m trying to shrink the amount of people whose approval matters to me.”</p> <p>He gave an example.</p> <p>A U.S. Senator wrote him. He said he reads "The Daily Stoic" every day. “I really liked today’s entry,” the Senator said. “It’s exactly what I try to think about for my office.”</p> <p>That’s the approval Ryan chose. He’s not after 10 million views on Facebook.</p> <p>“I try to think less about if what I’m doing is popular and more about if what I’m doing is being proven right.”</p> <p>It’s the same for entrepreneurs. You just need to attract a core group. And offer them real value. Because marketing won’t matter if your product sucks.</p> <p>Know your scene, know how to help them, and ignore the rest.</p> <hr /> <p>The Roman Empire was declining. And Stoicism was rising. “Things were bad,” Ryan said. “But they learned how to accept it.”</p> <p>They committed to high values and practiced self-reliance. I’ve become my own ruler a few times. Sometimes I was Marcus Aurelius, an emperor. And sometimes I was Epictetus, the slave.</p> <p>I don’t know what I am now.</p> <p>Maybe both.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“You and I both know what happened to you 18 months ago," he said.

I can safely, say, I’ve been in the trenches with Tucker.</p> <p>We’ve both started businesses since then, published books, invested together, and cried (well, I did) together since we’ve met.</p> <p>In one of the worst personal disasters of my life, Tucker was there. He was there for the beginning, middle, and end.</p> <p>I always ask myself ‘who is in my scene’?</p> <p>What’s a Scene?</p> <p>I consider it:<br /> - the people I learn from<br /> - the people who I can count on<br /> - the people who challenge me to work harder and rise to my potential (and I can do the same for)<br /> - the people I can call when I am confused or troubled, and the people who are there for me no matter what.</p> <p>Ask yourself: Who is in your scene?</p> <p>---</p> <p>Without a scene, it is much harder to succeed.

Talked reinvention, writing, and his current business success.</p> <p>Here’s the top five things I learned:</p> <p>A) THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO SUCCEED AND PEOPLE WHO DON’T</p> <p>“No one has ever replicated anything I did because they looked at the surface. They didn’t actually understand the underlying input.”</p> <p>“What do you mean by input?” I asked.</p> <p>“People look at my writing and they say, ‘I get drunk, I fall down, I yell curses… I’m going to write really arrogant things. Then I’ll get the same attention Tucker Max gets.’ But that never works.”</p> <p>“I was opening my soul,” he said. “I was being honest. Anybody trying to mimic me forgot the honesty part.” That’s the work. That’s the input.</p> <p>“If you want to boil it down, people who succeed are worried about input. People who don’t succeed are worried about output.”</p> <p>----</p> <p>B ) DIFFERENT > BETTER</p> <p>Spaces are getting crowded. Anyone can blog. Anyone can make a youtube video.

So how do you stand out?</p> <p>Micro-tribes.</p> <p>“I’m talking about being different, which is not the same thing as being better,” Tucker said.</p> <p>“When I started writing, I wrote emails for my friends and my only measurement for whether the emails were good or not was whether those nine guys thought it was funny. There was no arguing. If they did, it was good. If it didn’t, it was bad.”</p> <p>This reminded me of how Craig from Craigslist built his company. Started out with an email, with the sole intention of providing pleasure for his friends.</p> <p>Provide benefit for the few, and then you can scale to provide benefit for the many.</p> <p>Tucker found his micro-tribe. And it grew. Because his did this...</p> <p>---</p> <p>C) TELL THE TRUTH</p> <p>People send me articles all the time, "Can you read this?".</p> <p>I read one the other day. “How to survive a breakup” But the author left out his story.</p> <p>Advice is autobiography.</p> <p>Don’t give me advice from the mountaintop.

The hard truth that everybody thinks and nobody says.”</p> <p>---</p> <p>D) ASK YOUR QUESTION</p> <p>Last week I did seven podcasts. I probably asked 1000 questions.</p> <p>So I asked Tucker, “What’s the skill? How does one become a good writer?”</p> <p>He had one answer:</p> <p>Self-evaluate.</p> <p>Tucker asks himself three questions:</p> <p>Am I what I think I am?<br /> Am I who I want to be?<br /> Am I good at this or not?</p> <p>It gave me food for thought. Sometimes the more I work hard at something, I realize the worse I am.</p> <p>I want to improve.</p> <p>---</p> <p>E) WAS HE WRONG TO REJECT JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE?</p> <p>Tucker destroyed his own movie.</p> <p>"You will die as an artist," I said, laughing, "if you don't fully write this story."</p> <p>“I’ll never forget,” he said. “It was the night of my birthday… the night I knew the movie was a failure.”</p> <p>“Why’d you turn down Justin Timberlake for your movie?”</p> <p>“It’s embarrassing,” he said.</p> <p>I said, “Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone. I'll never write about it. I promise."</p> <p>“I was convinced the Tucker Max character was going to be huge and I wanted it to be about me, not the actor.”</p> <p>He was sorry.</p> <p>But, listen, if only 30% of our decisions are correct, we will have very successful lives. At least, that’s how it seems to me.</p> <p>And it's how you take a bad decision and later convert it into wisdom that is the true test of future success.</p> <p>“The same thing that screwed up my movie, happened in my company.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I have a rule. After every podcast, I write down 10 things I learned. I don't know if anyone else does this. Do you do this? Some people make illustrations. They send me what they've learned. It's a creation of a creation of a creation. A drawing of a podcast of someone's life.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I broke my rule. It's been over a month. And my brain is digging for the lessons from my interview with the creator of Wordpress. I think I have Alzheimer’s. Matt was 19 years old when he started Wordpress. It was 2003. Now Wordpress.com </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">gets more traffic than</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">Amazon.com</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times both use Wordpress. I use Wordpress.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know if it’s still worth the time and effort to make your own site. He said it is. That’s how you break out...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We're trying to revitalize the independent web,” Matt Mullenweg said. He’s 33 now. "It's not like these big sites are going anywhere. They're fantastic. I use all of them, but you want balance. You need your own site that belongs to you... like your own home on the Internet."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is part of Matt’s code. Not Wordpress’s “code.” Matt’s like a robot. I mean that as a compliment. There are many signs of this: language, ability, he’s very exact.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to interrupt. He was talking in code. And it was my job to translate.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said, "If I send you a unit of work...”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don't mean to interrupt,” I said. “I'm a little bit of an interrupter. So I apologize in advance, but you talk in a very code-like language…</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">'a unit of work.’</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">How about ‘a task?’ That works as well."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He laughed. And thanked me for translating. The podcast continued.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told me about his personal code (again, robot).</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People have values. Geniuses and other advanced forms of life  have “code.” So here’s Matt’s...</span></p> <p> A) Measure what’s important to you.</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt wrote a birthday blog. He does this every year to measure what’s changed. It lists how many books he’s read over the past year, countries he traveled to and so on.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s very specific.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a measurement of his personal freedom. He can see where time went. And if he chose himself. “You cannot change what you don’t measure,” Matt said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this year,</span> I wrote a birthday blog<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p><strong> B) Own the work you do</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Other sites provide space,” he said. “They provide distribution in exchange for owning all of your stuff. You can't leave Facebook or Twitter and take all of your followers with you."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why he recommends having your own website. It’s yours. Not Facebook’s. Not Business Insider’s or Huffington Post’s. It’s yours.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started jamesaltucher.com, I picked a template, posted a blog, shared a link on Twitter and within 3-4 minutes I had traffic.</span></p> <p> C) Ignore concern</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matt dropped out of college and moved to San Francisco when he was 20.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Were your parents upset?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ve always been supportive,” he said. “But they were concerned.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That didn’t stop him. He had direction. And when you know where you’re going, you don’t ask for directions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I feel like I’m driving with the wrong address in my GPS. And Siri won’t stop re-routing.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what I learned from Matt: Reroute yourself as many times as it takes. Reinvent.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put someone else’s concern for your wellbeing on your gratitude list. But don’t let it stop you. Don’t let it get in the way of your code.</span></p> <p> D) The myth of loyalty</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Matt moved and started his first job, he made more than his dad did.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I got an amazing salary,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept wondering if his parents were upset. I don’t know why.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Were they upset?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said no. Again. But then he explained. “Learning spreads organically.” And when he moved, it helped spark possibility for his dad.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He worked at the same company for 26 or 27 years. He more than doubled his salary when he left. It made me so sad. I never want anyone to be in the situation my dad was in,” he said. “He gave the loyalty of decades and they didn’t return that loyalty…”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because they were following a different code. The “employee code” is not the same as the “employer code.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t measure much. I try to let my life float by. And I hope to help people feel free enough to live by their own codes too. Like Matt and his dad.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how I measure what’s important to me. Am I supportive? Of myself and of others? If yes, then I’m a mix of creation and evolution. Robot and human.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code and DNA.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>She said, I am an introvert but had to develop tricks to fake being an extravert because of where I worked.</p> <p>I said, Do you think everyone in LA is an extravert?</p> <p>She said, I don’t know. Maybe they are all faking.</p> <p>We were at a party. I had been sleeping but a friend called me up and said “you have to go this party three blocks away from you.” So I did.</p> <p>Why? Because why not? Sometimes you know to say no. But to surrender to the moment, if nobody is getting hurt, sometimes you say yes. I went.</p> <p>It was crowded and I knew some of the people and some of the people I didn’t. I didn’t know her but we were introduced. “You have to ask her for [X} favor,” the introducer whispered to me. But I never got around to the favor.</p> <p>I said, can you tell me some of the tricks?</p> <p>I asked because sometimes I feel I don’t really know how to live and look like a normal person.</p> <p>Sometimes I like being home and writing and reading all day because that passes for human without me having to see, or touch, or talk to anyone. When I go outside, I often feel unhinged. Like I could float away.</p> <p>So I wanted to know.</p> <p>She didn’t tell me at first.</p> <p>Please.</p> <p>Ok, she said, sometimes I would do what I call a “dare of the day”. I would do something that I might be scared to do or was out of my comfort zone.</p> <p>I said, like what?</p> <p>She didn’t want to tell me.</p> <p>Please.</p> <p>She squinted her eyes at my face then touched my cheek and rubbed her fingers together as if pulling something off my face.</p> <p>I would go up to people, strangers, and pretend to pull a wisp of hair off of their face.</p> <p>That would freak me out, I said. Both doing it and having some stranger touch my face.</p> <p>I would do all sorts of things like that.</p> <p>Ok, I said, I want to try this. Start me off. Tell me more or tell me what I should do tomorrow.</p> <p>She said, I can’t.</p> <p>She made a motion with her fingers around her head the way people do when describing someone who is crazy.</p> <p>She said, Now that i’ve told you this your mind will start working on it. Tomorrow you will wake up and your body will know what to do.</p> <p>She told me the rest of her story, which was fascinating. Stay tuned for the podcast I hope she agrees to do.</p> <p>Then I went home. I woke up and I was upset about something that had happened earlier the day before.</p> <p>My friend Amy then had advice: go and eat pancakes and bacon and photograph it so I know you are eating. You have to prove it to me.</p> <p>I went. I ate. I photographed.</p> <p>Then my body knew what to do.</p> <p>I walked outside and there was a man and his daughter. I held up my hands with palms out, non-confrontational and said, “Good morning!” and they smiled and said good morning back.</p> <p>I started walking home. I saw a couple holding hands. Palms out, Good morning! And you [the girl] I love your blue hair. And you [the boy] I love your jacket.</p> <p>A pretty girl crossing the street. Good morning! She turned away and angled away from me as she walked past. I guess it might be taken the wrong way sometimes. Maybe it might not be attractive.</p> <p>I said to a guy opening up his store. Good morning! He smiled. Hey, good morning, guy.</p> <p>I said it all the way home. I got home. I didn’t feel down anymore. The sun was coming in. I started to write.</p> <p>First I wrote the girl from the party and told her what happened.</p> <p>She wrote back (i’m going to paraphrase), don’t record your dares. That’s why I was hesitant to tell you the dares I did.</p> <p>Ok, other than this one, I won’t.</p> <p>She said it will take a few weeks to figure out your boundaries on dares. Both personal and physical.</p> <p>She said, don’t dare anyone else to do this.</p> <p>I didn’t understand her reason. But maybe it would affect the way I did my own dares. SO DON’T DO THIS.</p> <p>I wanted to leave the party but I had one more question.</p> <p>What did you do after you were working in LA for so long as an assistant.</p> <p>She said, I went to get a PhD in Robotics at [best school in world for Robotics]. She laughed and I think she said, maybe that was a dare for myself also.</p> <p>I went home. I went to sleep. And she was right.</p> <p>My mind was going crazy that night. But in a good way.</p>]]></description>

He needed a logo.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie Millman just started her agency. She was competing against the best ad agencies in New York City.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She lost. So she moved on to Burger King.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Why do you think you lost?"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"We didn't have insurance," Debbie said. "We didn't have the big, global brand experience to show them."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I'll never forget this," she said. "When we got to Burger King headquarters, we got into a fairly small elevator with the Senior Vice President of Market Research. The door closes. He looks at us and says, 'Don't get your hopes up.'"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is important. Because Debbie Millman never describes herself as an entrepreneur.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she's the perfect example.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurship is about putting your all into something, getting rejected and going back into the next room.  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data is taking over. Data is replacing thinking and driving the direction of the future. Data sells confidence. And that's what the brands wanted.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burger King tried changing their logo 7 times in the decade leading up to Debbie's success.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So she did focus groups. And studied eye-tracking on the original logo. "We wanted to know what people thought," she said. "We wanted to get a sense of why this was so beloved?"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"People do not read first. First and foremost, they see color. Then they see numbers, then shape, and then, if you still have their attention and they understand what you put in front of them, then they will read."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A logo is a message. Even if you don't read it. You can recognize logos visually without reading. Our brains know.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we choose who we belong to. And that's our tribe.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie was changing the face of an iconic brand. And change causes fear, which strikes up all the stress hormones in our body.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"In order for us to create an identity that was evolving from the original, we had to keep some of those iconic elements."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You're original. As a baby, you were a blank canvas. No logo. No brand. No name. And no identity.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then you went to school and made friends and things happened to you. Someone asked me, "who will you always be? Who's James? When you're 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 84, what parts of you will always be there?"</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's what Debbie had to figure out with her brands. She did it with Tropicana, Star Wars, and eventually, she won Ben & Jerry's over too.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But after all of this data, all of this color, all of this branding, at the heart of it is the essence of who you are. What is the logo of your heart.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Debbie figured out hers. And created her life around it. Figuring out who we are is the key to having an impact all over the world.</span></p> <p> <span style="font-weight: 400;">That's what Debbie taught me on this podcast. That's what I try every day to create in my own life.  </span></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 217 - Tony Robbins: How to Be Fulfilled: Just Start Asking Yourself These 2 Questions</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tony Robbins stopped by on his birthday. And then he started causing problems. Like he does.<br /> <br /> "I realize you're high energy," the audio engineer says, looking at Tony, "but when you bang the table it sounds like the whole room is shaking."<span class="text_exposed_show"><br /> <br /> In 220 podcasts, it's the first time the audio engineer had to interrupt in the middle.<br /> <br /> "Oh, ok, no problem," Tony says.<br /> <br /> "I don't want to stop the passion," the audio engineer says.<br /> <br /> "Don't worry, I'll be good," Tony says.<br /> <br /> Then the audio engineer went back outside.<br /> <br /> Tony kept slamming that table. Outside the room, people thought he was going to climb over the table and beat the S**t out of me. But it was all good.<br /> <br /> BUT...<br /> <br /> I felt like I had to keep the energy level high. So pretty soon we were both yelling back and forth.<br /> <br /> He was there because of his new book, "Unshakeable". But we spoke about maybe 1000 topics. Not just the financial world.<br /> <br /> So let's get right down to it. What did I learn?<br /> <br /> - EVERY YEAR (on average) THE STOCK MARKET WILL FALL 10%<br /> <br /> This is great for newspapers. They say, "The world is ending!" and they say it EVERY SINGLE YEAR.<br /> <br /> And yet it never does. It never did. Even in 2008. The world did not end. The market is at all time highs right now.<br /> <br /> The key with Tony's book is he shows these statistics not so you can make money off of them but so you DON'T PANIC.<br /> <br /> Markets move. Ignore the news.<br /> <br /> - BRING IT<br /> <br /> Before the podcast I said to Tony, "let's do a fun outtake". I wasn't sure he'd say "yes". We videotaped it (it's on my instagram).<br /> <br /> He BRINGS IT. It's so much energy I almost had to stutter out my planned line ("I can't see your face on Skype, only your chest").<br /> <br /> And when we did the podcast, I felt like I had to yell and really UP my own energy level at least three levels higher just to keep pace with him. I don't know how he does it.<br /> <br /> SO....!<br /> <br /> I asked. How do you do it? I want that energy also.<br /> <br /> Please?<br /> <br /> - DON'T ASK HOW, INSTEAD ASK 'WHY!?'<br /> <br /> He finally said, "Enough with the 'how-to'. Don't ask 'how-to' questions".<br /> <br /> He said, "Ask What and Why?" What is the Result. Why is your purpose.<br /> <br /> "Why are you getting out of bed in the morning? And what are you going to do about it?<br /> <br /> "Motive matters and brings energy".<br /> <br /> He said, "I love lighting people up." That, he said, gives me the energy.<br /> <br /> When I later found out his schedule, not only was he booked every hour that day with different news sources (he started the day by ringing the bell at the Nasdaq) but IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY.<br /> <br /> He brings it.<br /> <br /> - TRADE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR APPRECIATIONS<br /> <br /> This is critical for well-being. Don't expect the world to provide you with happiness.<br /> <br /> Every time you find yourself slipping into an expectation, change it in your head into an "appreciation". Find the things you appreciate. Then take ACTION.<br /> <br /> "It's like a practice," I said.<br /> <br /> He banged the table.<br /> <br /> "Exactly!"<br /> <br /> - MODELING<br /> <br /> I said, "how do you learn new things?"<br /> <br /> He said, "Modeling."<br /> <br /> I said, "Well, I imagine you look great walking down a runway at a fashion show but seriously."<br /> <br /> He laughed and said, "Look, when I went to write the Money book and then my new book, Unshakeable, I didn't just sit around reading the paper.<br /> <br /> "I went out with a video crew and interviewed 50 billionaires about how they invest.<br /> <br /> "I watch what they do. I study how they think. And I see if I can break it down into chunks so that anyone can follow their process."<br /> <br /> In my last podcast with Tony, two years ago, he described how he learned how expert Marines improve their firing skills even though he had never fired gun before. He described almost the same process then.<br /> <br /> For me, I know this works. When I want to write, I always read first.<br /> <br /> When I want to do public speaking, I watch standup comedians (and singers) first. I want to figure out how the best people in the world do something so I can do it 1/100 as good at the very least.<br /> <br /> When I need energy now, I picture Tony Robbins smashing the table and the audio engineer begging me to slow it down.<br /> <br /> Well too bad!<br /> <br /> - SURRENDER TO WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL<br /> <br /> "If your happiness requires other people to behave the way you want them to behave, then what are the chances you're going to stay happy in your life?<br /> <br /> "You'd have to limit yourself to a small number of humans... who you can control, which is not love."<br /> <br /> - DON'T WAIT FOR FREEDOM<br /> <br /> Learn how to deal with stress. That's the path to freedom. Not the other way around<br /> <br /> He gives many techniques. One of them is to learn to appreciate the things around you. But more than that, he says.<br /> <br /> Take, "Massive Action". Show people you appreciate them. Take steps forward in a career. Feed your mind. Help someone. Cultivate great thoughts. Strengthen your body. Participate. "You activate your body's chemistry."<br /> <br /> "Doing nothing, you learn nothing".<br /> <br /> How do you do this?<br /> <br /> Again, "How brings in fear". You have to have an emotional purpose. Something more than yourself. Purpose is "why?"<br /> <br /> Find a role model so that you realize that what you want is attainable for you.<br /> <br /> - DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR MIND<br /> <br /> He said to me, "what are the two things you are most worried about in life?"<br /> <br /> No problem. I didn't hesitate. "I constantly worry about going broke and that someone will cheat on me."<br /> <br /> He leaned forward.<br /> <br /> "EVERYBODY IS WORRIED ABOUT THOSE TWO THINGS!" he said. "That's not your worries. That's the mind's worries. It's in everyone's mind."<br /> <br /> Don't bother negotiating with your mind. It's there to protect you but it's used to the jungle from 50,000 years ago.<br /> <br /> Find things that are bigger than just you. Make those things your purpose. Your reason for living. They can change. But they will be the things that take you to freedom.<br /> <br /> Not your mind.<br /> <br /> And, he said, when I am afraid to do something, that's when I do it!<br /> <br /> - LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SUFFER<br /> <br /> "I had mercury poisoning this past year. I also had a problem with my back that could have been critical.<br /> <br /> "But I did a ton of research. I spoke to many doctors and other people with similar problems. I worked on my own issues and did not let them bring me down."<br /> <br /> "I am responsible to choose my own happiness," he said.<br /> <br /> I think I'm paraphrasing. We spoke about so many things I can't remember everything.<br /> <br /> Sometimes when I prepare a podcast, i read so many books, watch so many interviews, jot down so many notes, and get so much nervous energy ready that I feel like it burns like a bright hot light for the entire podcast and then dims once it's over.<br /> <br /> - IT IS REALLY REALLY HARD TO INTERRUPT TONY ROBBINS!<br /> <br /> Man, it is hard. It's like trying to stop a tank. I think I my "interruption skills" greatly improved during this one hour. I simply couldn't do it at first.<br /> <br /> But finally I had to do it. He said, "And then President Clinton called me and..."<br /> <br /> I had to yell, "STOP!"<br /> <br /> "Will you finally tell me why the hell Presidents call you?"<br /> <br /> And he answered.<br /> <br /> After Tony left I had to go catch an airplane. About six hours later I finally felt like I was starting to calm down.<br /> <br /> At the airport I ran into someone on Tony's team. She said, Tony really enjoyed the podcast.<br /> <br /> I don't know if she says that to everyone. But I was happy.<br /> <br /> I know I enjoyed it. I know I learned a lot. I know it got me to start thinking again about why I get up in the morning, about what emotional purposeI want to have greater than myself.<br /> <br /> It changes every day. But it's there. It has to be.<br /> <br /> Today it was: Write this post.<br /> <br /> Oh, and run for Governor. But more on that later.</span></p>]]></description>

So pretty soon we were both yelling back and forth.  He was there because of his new book, "Unshakeable". But we spoke about maybe 1000 topics. Not just the financial world.  So let's get right down to it. What did I learn?  - EVERY YEAR (on average) THE STOCK MARKET WILL FALL 10%  This is great for newspapers. They say, "The world is ending!" and they say it EVERY SINGLE YEAR.  And yet it never does. It never did. Even in 2008. The world did not end. The market is at all time highs right now.  The key with Tony's book is he shows these statistics not so you can make money off of them but so you DON'T PANIC.  Markets move. Ignore the news.  - BRING IT  Before the podcast I said to Tony, "let's do a fun outtake". I wasn't sure he'd say "yes". We videotaped it (it's on my instagram).  He BRINGS IT. It's so much energy I almost had to stutter out my planned line ("I can't see your face on Skype, only your chest").  And when we did the podcast, I felt like I had to yell and really UP my own energy level at least three levels higher just to keep pace with him. I don't know how he does it.  SO....!  I asked. How do you do it? I want that energy also.  Please?  - DON'T ASK HOW, INSTEAD ASK 'WHY!?'  He finally said, "Enough with the 'how-to'. Don't ask 'how-to' questions".  He said, "Ask What and Why?" What is the Result. Why is your purpose.  "Why are you getting out of bed in the morning? And what are you going to do about it?  "Motive matters and brings energy".  He said, "I love lighting people up." That, he said, gives me the energy.  When I later found out his schedule, not only was he booked every hour that day with different news sources (he started the day by ringing the bell at the Nasdaq) but IT WAS HIS BIRTHDAY.  He brings it.  - TRADE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR APPRECIATIONS  This is critical for well-being. Don't expect the world to provide you with happiness.  Every time you find yourself slipping into an expectation, change it in your head into an "appreciation". Find the things you appreciate. Then take ACTION.  "It's like a practice," I said.  He banged the table.  "Exactly!"  - MODELING  I said, "how do you learn new things?"  He said, "Modeling."  I said, "Well, I imagine you look great walking down a runway at a fashion show but seriously."  He laughed and said, "Look, when I went to write the Money book and then my new book, Unshakeable, I didn't just sit around reading the paper.  "I went out with a video crew and interviewed 50 billionaires about how they invest.  "I watch what they do. I study how they think. And I see if I can break it down into chunks so that anyone can follow their process."  In my last podcast with Tony, two years ago, he described how he learned how expert Marines improve their firing skills even though he had never fired gun before. He described almost the same process then.  For me, I know this works. When I want to write, I always read first.  When I want to do public speaking, I watch standup comedians (and singers) first. I want to figure out how the best people in the world do something so I can do it 1/100 as good at the very least.  When I need energy now, I picture Tony Robbins smashing the table and the audio engineer begging me to slow it down.  Well too bad!  - SURRENDER TO WHAT YOU CAN'T CONTROL  "If your happiness requires other people to behave the way you want them to behave, then what are the chances you're going to stay happy in your life?  "You'd have to limit yourself to a small number of humans... who you can control, which is not love."  - DON'T WAIT FOR FREEDOM  Learn how to deal with stress. That's the path to freedom. Not the other way around  He gives many techniques. One of them is to learn to appreciate the things around you. But more than that, he says.  Take, "Massive Action". Show people you appreciate them. Take steps forward in a career. Feed your mind. Help someone. Cultivate great thoughts. Strengthen your body. Participate. "You activate your body's chemistry."  "Doing nothing, you learn nothing".  How do you do this?  Again, "How brings in fear". You have to have an emotional purpose. Something more than yourself. Purpose is "why?"  Find a role model so that you realize that what you want is attainable for you.  - DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH YOUR MIND  He said to me, "what are the two things you are most worried about in life?"  No problem. I didn't hesitate. "I constantly worry about going broke and that someone will cheat on me."  He leaned forward.  "EVERYBODY IS WORRIED ABOUT THOSE TWO THINGS!" he said. "That's not your worries. That's the mind's worries. It's in everyone's mind."  Don't bother negotiating with your mind. It's there to protect you but it's used to the jungle from 50,000 years ago.  Find things that are bigger than just you. Make those things your purpose. Your reason for living. They can change. But they will be the things that take you to freedom.  Not your mind.  And, he said, when I am afraid to do something, that's when I do it!  - LIFE IS TOO SHORT TO SUFFER  "I had mercury poisoning this past year. I also had a problem with my back that could have been critical.  "But I did a ton of research. I spoke to many doctors and other people with similar problems. I worked on my own issues and did not let them bring me down."  "I am responsible to choose my own happiness," he said.  I think I'm paraphrasing. We spoke about so many things I can't remember everything.  Sometimes when I prepare a podcast, i read so many books, watch so many interviews, jot down so many notes, and get so much nervous energy ready that I feel like it burns like a bright hot light for the entire podcast and then dims once it's over.  - IT IS REALLY REALLY HARD TO INTERRUPT TONY ROBBINS!  Man, it is hard. It's like trying to stop a tank. I think I my "interruption skills" greatly improved during this one hour. I simply couldn't do it at first.  But finally I had to do it. He said, "And then President Clinton called me and..."  I had to yell, "STOP!"  "Will you finally tell me why the hell Presidents call you?"  And he answered.  After Tony left I had to go catch an airplane. About six hours later I finally felt like I was starting to calm down.  At the airport I ran into someone on Tony's team. She said, Tony really enjoyed the podcast.  I don't know if she says that to everyone. But I was happy.  I know I enjoyed it. I know I learned a lot. I know it got me to start thinking again about why I get up in the morning, about what emotional purposeI want to have greater than myself.  It changes every day. But it's there. It has to be.  Today it was: Write this post.  Oh, and run for Governor. But more on that later.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>My ancestor from 70,000 years ago was smarter than me. He knew every plant, mushroom, animal, predator, prey in a several mile radius.</p> <p>He knew how to make weapons. He knew how to capture something, make it edible. I can barely order delivery. And as far as weapons, they say “the pen is mightier than the sword” but I don’t think a tweet is.</p> <p>My ancestor also knew how to adapt to new terrains, how to handle strangers who could be threats, how to learn who to trust and who not to trust. I wish I had his skills.</p> <p>Not only that. Archaeological evidence says his brain was bigger than mine. And bigger is better.</p> <p>To make things worse, another animal made the entire human race its slave. Wheat domesticated us. It forced us to stick around for the harvest, horde up for years when the harvest might be bad, go from a life of a diverse diet to basically all carbs all the time. And it turned us from hunters to farmers.</p> <p>But it’s not all bad. And the news is actually very good. Probably the books I’ve recommended most in the past five years was “Sapiens” by Yuval Harari. And not only me: it’s Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg’s top recommendation.</p> <p>And now Yuval has a new book, “Homo Deus” – i.e. where are humans heading? If Sapiens explored the last 70,000 years of human history, “Homo Deus” takes the trends into the future. What will happen next?</p> <p>The answers are fascinating. And I had even more questions. I couldn’t believe I was finally talking to Yuval after reading “Sapiens” so many times and recommending it on every list and giving the book to all of my friends. And then finally reading “Homo Deus“.</p> <p>What made humans the only animal to spread across the entire globe? What was special about us? How did we go hundreds of miles into empty water to find Australia for instance? I would never take that risk! And then survive and flourish in a completely new ecosystem, just like we did in North America.</p> <p>“Fiction,” Yuval told me, and describes in his book. “We created elaborate fictions for ourselves: ‘nations’, ‘corporations’, ‘religion’, ‘crusades’, and perhaps the most successful fiction: ‘money’. So I could use a dollar and some stranger in China can use a dollar and we can trust each other enough to do a transaction.”</p> <p>So what’s next? “Homo sapiens are going to evolve again.” Yuval said, “Technology is taking us there and technology is evolving much faster than we are.”</p> <p>I still can’t believe I spoke to him. Five years ago I took his course on Coursera. I was thinking, “how did this guy get so smart?” And now I was talking to him.</p> <p>And, like I said, the news was not bad.</p> <p>Here’s what I learned:</p> <p>1. The economy needs you to invest in yourself</p> <p>“There’s a change in the nature of the economy from a material based economy to a knowledge-based economy. The main assets in the past were material like gold minds or wheat fields,” Yuval said. “These are the types of things you can conquer through violence.”</p> <p>That’s how we got California. The US invaded and absorbed their wealth. But you can’t invade and absorb knowledge.</p> <p>China isn’t going to take over Silicon Valley and absorb all the wealth. “Today, the main asset is knowledge,” he said.</p> <p>The only good investment you can make for your future is the investment you make in yourself today.</p> <p>Hone your idea muscle, build a network and a library of mentors, make a commitment to do one healthy thing a day. Because the health of your body impacts the health of your brain.</p> <p>I try to improve 1% a day. That’s it. That’s how I invest in myself.</p> <p>2. Explore Internal realities vs. External realities</p> <p>Resources today are different. They’re abstract.</p> <p>Yuval said, “The source of wealth in California today is knowledge, in the mind’s of engineers and technicians and CEOs. And you just cannot conquer it by force.”</p> <p>That’s one of the reason’s why Yuval says, “You see a decline in international violence.”</p> <p>The other reason: weapons are too powerful.</p> <p>“Nuclear weapons have transformed war between superpowers,” he said. War today is “collective suicide, which is why we don’t have such wars since 1945.”</p> <p>Terrorism is different. Their weapon is fear. Yuval calls it “psychological menace.” But he’s really concerned about them in our future.</p> <p>“Terrorists function by capturing our imagination, turning our imagination against us, and causing us to overreact,” he said.</p> <p>“In a way, a terrorist is like a fly that tries to destroy a china shop. The fly is so small and weak. It cannot move even a single teacup. So how does a fly destroy a china shop? The fly finds a bull, gets into the ear of the bull and starts buzzing. The bull becomes so enraged that it loses its temper and destroys the china shop. This is what happened in the middle east over the last 15 years,” Yuval said.</p> <p>“Al-Qaeda could never destroy Iraq by itself. It got into the ear of the United States and the United States went wild and destroyed the middle eastern china shop for Al-Qaeda. This is how terrorism functions. And if you want to fight terrorism you should start with your own imagination.”</p> <p>For me, this means understanding that ideas are currency. Becoming an idea machine, writing ten ideas a day, so you get the new ‘weapons’ of Sapiens, is the key.</p> <p>3. We’re going from “humanists” to “data-ists”</p> <p>In 500 years we might not be dealing with humans at all.</p> <p>Look at Amazon for example. They tell us what to buy. We don’t ask our friends. We ask data.</p> <p>“Given the advances of bioengineering, brain-computer interfaces and so forth, I think it’s very likely that within a century or two homo sapiens will disappear and be replaced by a completely different kind of being,” Yuval said.</p> <p>He says bioengineering is just one possibility. Another is we start connecting brains and computers to create cyborgs.</p> <p>This isn’t science fiction. It’s already happening.</p> <p>I’m sort of scared and sort of excited. We went from tribes to villages to cities to kingdoms to empires to “isms” to…data that will unite us.</p> <p>The next step in our evolution. The final frontier.</p>]]></description>

What you might not know is that George Lucas tried to buy the rights to the old TV serial “Flash Gordon”. He wanted to make the movie.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first podcast is 24 minutes long. It’s just me. No guest. The topic: “Why College Is a Waste of Time.” Then I did one about my book “Choose Yourself.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One week later, I got 30 minutes with Robert Greene. Then an hour with Tucker Max, an hour with Gary Vaynerchuk, and an hour with AJ Jacobs.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A month later I interviewed Dr. Wayne Dyer. Two months, Arianna Huffington. Six months, Mark Cuban.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t have an editor or a microphone. Three years later everyone has (or should do!) a podcast.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It connects me with people I never thought possible. Or in AJ Jacobs’ case, it connects people with family they didn’t know existed. That’s the theme of his new podcast, “Twice Removed.”</span></p> <p>“The good news is once you realize that everyone is family, you can just choose,” AJ said. “So you’re not stuck. You’ve got the whole world to choose from.”</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first guest was Dan Savage, the sex columnist for “The Village Voice.” In the other room, AJ had a secret guest, a relative 41 degrees removed from Dan.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, AJ unravels the 41 connections. He had Dan in tears.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re all connected,” AJ said. “People have called genealogy the museum of me. We all see the world through our own lens.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I learned from AJ’s lens…</span></p> <p>1. Start with X</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first started doing an interview podcast my audience size was X. Then I improved the quality and my downloads went to 3X.  In the case of “Twice Removed,” “Start Up” and “Freakonomics” adding production makes it 10X.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For every minute that makes the air there are hours that don’t,” AJ said. “You can make 18 different shows using the same material.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key is to do the best with what you have today. It cost $0 to make “The James Altucher Show.” And I got to do what I never dreamed possible for the first 40 years of my life.</span></p> <p>2. Show the truth</p> <p>The arc of a good story starts with a problem. Luke Skywalker wanted to explore but he couldn’t until his aunt and uncle were killed by stormtroopers. Bruce Wayne’s parents were killed in the first few panels of Batman.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need a problem to kickstart an otherwise reluctant hero.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love to tell my kids about my family's failures,” AJ said. “Honestly, I think they think I’m total loser.”  </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ told me about an Emory University study. It showed kids adjust better when they’re told about their family’s failures.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s the narrative of ‘We were always successful’ or ‘We’re always losers.’ Families are oscillating,” AJ said. “You go through times where things are going well and times when it’s total failure. Tell your kids about the struggles your family has undergone and that you emerged ok… that you survived.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give yourself permission to have an imperfect life.</span></p> <p>3. Surprise Yourself</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ learned this from a writer at “The Daily Show.” “He talked about how important it is to surprise yourself and make yourself laugh,” AJ said, “which at the time I didn’t really understand.”</span></p> <p>So he tested it.</p> <p>“As you’re writing, take a left turn that your brain didn’t expect.” He does this in “Twice Removed.” And in our interview.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told me about an experiment he did with his wife. They filmed 24 hours of their day for weeks. Every argument was caught on tape. And they checked it frequently to see who was right.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was bad either way,” he said. “Because if I was wrong I looked like an idiot, but if I was right she would just get angrier.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So they quit that experiment. And he started a new one: “Twice Removed.”</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 212 - Anna Koppelman: How to Find Your World... Where You Belong</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Anna Koppelman is an angel. She’s the angel I wish I had looking over me  back when I was being bullied.</p> <p>When I was a kid, it was “Lord of The Flies” on the playground. Nobody cared at all. Kids would kill each other at recess and whoever survived went back to class.</p> <p>But it’s different now. Bullying is a thing. It has a voice. And there’s a way out of the world of “you’re not good enough” and into the world where you belong…</p> <p>I read an article on Facebook that was going viral:"What I know Now As a Teen With Dsylexia."</p> <p>Anna Koppelman wrote it. Then she kept writing.</p> <p>When I read the article, I thought Anna was one of those alien millennials taking over the world. But even worse, she’s not a millenial. Ever since birth she’s been on the Internet. She’s an eleventh grader. Which makes her 17 or so. Generation Z… it’s a totally different animal.</p> <p>Anna started a charity when she was 12 years old. At 14, she asked the Huffington Post to publish her work. They said yes.</p> <p>Then she wrote about dyslexia, bullying, intelligence, her crushes, her rejections, and each article felt like it was going a level deeper. Her writings were read everywhere by teens who had been through similar experiences.</p> <p>I wish I had this as a kid. A world where I could talk to people going through what I was going through. A way to connect to my “tribe”. Or a way to reach out to people and we could all figure out we weren’t alone.</p> <p>“I couldn’t not say it,” she said. “I had this feeling at school and in my life of just not being able to connect with people… I had a feeling of isolation since first grade, like there was Saran wrap between me and the rest of the world.”</p> <p>Here’s what I learned from Anna Koppelman about finding out where you belong…</p> <p>1. Figure out another way</p> <p>When Anna’s “friends” discovered she couldn’t read, they laughed. “You’re not smart enough to be our friend,” they said.</p> <p>She was pushed out of the tribe.</p> <p>But then she learned from a moose.</p> <p>“I was watching the children’s show, ‘Arthur.’ And there was this kid on there. He was a moose. He had dyslexia. So I turned to my parents and said, ‘I have dyslexia.’”</p> <p>“How did this moose exhibit the dyslexia?”</p> <p>“It was all just about the same feelings that I was feeling… where he was behind in his class, but he had all these great ideas he wanted to get out but couldn’t. And the feeling of being trapped because there’s something in your brain that’s processing differently.”</p> <p>But she found another way. And learned how to read. But kids kept making fun of her. For the next 10 years.</p> <p>“I just wanted to connect with people,” she said. “When I would write, I would be able to connect with people. When I would perform poetry, I would be able to connect with people.”</p> <p>“What do you mean perform poetry?”</p> <p>I was confused.</p> <p>Because it sounded like her life was miserable at school. And instead of going to school with the eye patch and going straight home, she’d head back out to go read slam poetry in front of a dozen+ strangers.</p> <p>“What made you do that?”</p> <p>“I knew that no matter how awful school was there was a world outside of school and I just needed to find that world.”</p> <p>2. Use your skills</p> <p>Anna started out writing about her interests. People spend years writing about things outside themselves.</p> <p>I did too.</p> <p>But for years I was afraid to write about the things that really scared me, or drove me, or kept me up at night. I was afraid to write about the things that shamed me. Or I was afraid because I wondered what people would think.</p> <p>So I wanted to learn, what did Anna, at age 14, do differently?</p> <p>Start with craft. Write everyday. Use your brain. Develop your analytical muscle. Build your skills.</p> <p>Talent is the ignition in the car. Many people have talent. Many people never turn on the car. Many people never drive the car to get to their destination.</p> <p>Skills are just talent in its infancy.</p> <p>3. Create from one layer deeper</p> <p>I asked Anna about courage. A lot of people want to change their lives. But few take next steps .And I feel that even fewer young kids, dying to fit into their close-knit world of school and popularity, take those next steps.</p> <p>I wanted to know what triggered that point. “How did you hit publish? Weren’t you afraid?”</p> <p>“I didn’t have any friends,” she said. “I was eating lunch alone pretty much everyday. I was just in a really sad place. And the kids in my grade were really mean to me. I just felt that there was no real happiness. But when I would sit down and eat lunch alone, I would start to write in my notebook or I would write on my computer.”</p> <p>She didn’t know the risk.</p> <p>And in a strange way, these horrible experiences helped her become the writer she is today.</p> <p>“The things that have happened in my life,” she said, “got me to a place where I have more of an ability and belief in myself…”</p> <p>The transition came when she revealed her scars. She showed the deepest sides of her struggle. And bled on paper.</p> <p>Only by taking risks can a person unleash the hidden talents inside.</p> <p>Vulnerability bleeds. And connects you to the world… your world. It connects you to where you belong.</p> <p>4. Always be kind</p> <p>A boy at school tricked her. He was always mean. But she thought things could change. “I was throwing parties for children in need,” she said. “I had been doing it since middle school.”</p> <p>He said he wanted to throw a bake sale for Birthday Fairies.</p> <p>“And I believed him.”</p> <p>He got all the popular kids to “help.”</p> <p>“Then the day of the bake sale came. None of them baked anything and they all just kind of laughed.”</p> <p>“This is like Steven King’s ‘Carrie. Did you psychically spill blood all over them?”</p> <p>She didn’t… I guess angels don’t spill blood on people.</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder what it’s like to be a kid now. For my entire life since birth to be connected up to a much bigger world. I’m jealous of the kids born now. How they can turn to this global tribe to develop their talents.</p> <p>But it’s not connectivity that makes you a better person. Or connects you to better relationships. Or builds up your latent skills. Or helps you find your passions.</p> <p>No matter who you are, it’s taking those next positive steps, those first risks that turn talent into skill, those first vulnerabilities that connect you to others – this is the key to unleashing that bigger world, that brings you to a tribe bigger than who you are.</p> <p>This is what I learned today from Anna.  </p>]]></description>

But when I would sit down and eat lunch alone, I would start to write in my notebook or I would write on my computer.”</p> <p>She didn’t know the risk.</p> <p>And in a strange way, these horrible experiences helped her become the writer she is today.</p> <p>“The things that have happened in my life,” she said, “got me to a place where I have more of an ability and belief in myself…”</p> <p>The transition came when she revealed her scars. She showed the deepest sides of her struggle. And bled on paper.</p> <p>Only by taking risks can a person unleash the hidden talents inside.</p> <p>Vulnerability bleeds. And connects you to the world… your world. It connects you to where you belong.</p> <p>4. Always be kind</p> <p>A boy at school tricked her. He was always mean. But she thought things could change. “I was throwing parties for children in need,” she said. “I had been doing it since middle school.”</p> <p>He said he wanted to throw a bake sale for Birthday Fairies.</p> <p>“And I believed him.”</p> <p>He got all the popular kids to “help.”</p> <p>“Then the day of the bake sale came. None of them baked anything and they all just kind of laughed.”</p> <p>“This is like Steven King’s ‘Carrie. Did you psychically spill blood all over them?”</p> <p>She didn’t… I guess angels don’t spill blood on people.</p> <p>Sometimes I wonder what it’s like to be a kid now. For my entire life since birth to be connected up to a much bigger world. I’m jealous of the kids born now. How they can turn to this global tribe to develop their talents.</p> <p>But it’s not connectivity that makes you a better person. Or connects you to better relationships. Or builds up your latent skills. Or helps you find your passions.</p> <p>No matter who you are, it’s taking those next positive steps, those first risks that turn talent into skill, those first vulnerabilities that connect you to others – this is the key to unleashing that bigger world, that brings you to a tribe bigger than who you are.</p> <p>This is what I learned today from Anna.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard an eight-year-old kid tell another eight-year-old that he's not welcome in his home. He said "Trump or Clinton?"</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Clinton."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was that. They kept walking.

I try to listen, come up with ideas, and be grateful. Because if I listen, I learn. And then I can say two sweet words, “thank you.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How many people said, "If Trump becomes president, I'm leaving the country." Or the other way around?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's only one reason why I’d ever even consider packing. And Bobby Casey spelled it out for me.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Americans don't understand how insanely expensive it is to live in the U.S.," Bobby said on my podcast.  He sold everything he owned and left the country in 2009. Right after the market crashed. Now he works all over the world. And helps people get off the grid.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know how he did it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I hated my customers," he said. "I hated my employees, I hated my job, I hated my business."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"But what made you think you could sell all your belonging and travel the world forever?"</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Weren't you scared you would run out of money?"</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I just knew I'd work it out," he said. "I'd make some money."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t do it. It’s easy to be uncertain when you’re level of unknown isn’t going to erupt your central nervous system.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Bobby had motivation.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My happiness and my quality of life is much more important than cashing out on a business,” he said. “I didn’t care. I wanted to be happy again.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he got rid of everything. He gave away motorcycles. (He had 27). Then he</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">bought two one-way tickets to Prague. One for him. And one for his 9 year old son.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’d never been there.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of his family moved a few weeks later. He has three kids.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"What about friends? And school?" I asked.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"My daughter, she's 20, she's a rapper in London. She did two years of virtual school. And she can make friends anywhere. It’s her personality type.” His other two kids enrolled with locals.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had 100 questions. "How'd you get the confidence? What type of freelance work did you do?" “How did you make ends meet?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He broke it down for me. And told me all the ways he saves money living abroad.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">I did the math on this,” he said.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">"You won't believe this, but I pay $42 a year for a 10,000 euro deductible health insurance plan."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything after 10,000 euros, he's covered. "I could get airlifted to John Hopkins if I wanted and that would be covered."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"You can make about $150,000, tax-free, as an American living abroad." Here’s how Bobby explains it on the podcast...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you make $100K (gross) in the U.S, then you’re probably netting less than $60K. Abroad, you can make the same $60K (net), live tax-free (if you qualify for the “foreign earned income exclusion”), get a housing allowance, pay $42 a year for health insurance, and basically never feel broke again.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was getting depressed. Because I know I’m not going to move. It’s part of being human. Everyone I look up to, Scott Adams, Dan Ariely, Nassim Taleb, they all say the same thing: people are irrational creatures. Even the idea that we’re being rational, is irrational.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time Bobby spoke, I had 10 new questions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I'd never understand. But then he gave me his secret. And it answered all my questions.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was so simple. I couldn't believe it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bobby and his son were walking around Estonia. They left Prague, bought a house and had no plans.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone overheard them speaking English.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re American?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They started talking. “What are you planning to do for your kids for school?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bobby had no idea.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a son who’s your son’s age.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media is a bloodbath.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump. Hilary. Walls. Genitals. Crooked this or Deplorable that.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's two things I know:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1)  I choose whether I am happy with a situation or not. Whether I am "free" or not. Nobody else can choose that for me unless I give them permission.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a situation (call it X) happens that I don't like, I ask myself: is the world better with X and me in it. Or with X and "no me".</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I can do is have impact on the people around me. And if it's worthwhile impact, if it's the sort of impact that helps people and creates positive change, then those people around me will share it with the people around them.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That's how things get done. That's how one "votes" with their life every single day. No excuse.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2) I'm not the smartest person in the room.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a situation happens that I don't understand, I don't pretend to understand it. I don't go ahead and act like I understand it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no clue.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I ask the smartest person in the room. I ask the people who know more than me. I ask people I respect who might have opposing views.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has many opposing views. And I admit that I don't understand all the facts. I ask people who have more facts than me. Who have studied more than me.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I automatically agree with them? It doesn't matter. They feed my brain. I know they will because I already trust them to think carefully about an issue and I trust their years of experience.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then I think. Then I decide.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it change what I do?</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do what I do. I try to keep having impact in the way that I know best. I want to be a free person. This doesn't mean rich. Which often entangles me too much in the addiction of having more and more.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor does it mean have everyone love me. Because that is also is something outside of me that is out of my control.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom means I can make choices. Freedom means I can make as many choices as possible to live the life I want to live.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to learn more about what a Donald Trump presidency might mean. There is so much blood shed trying to force me to have one opinion or the other, I decided to call one of the smartest people I know.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ken Kurson shed some light for me on things that were confusing me. Do I have to agree with everything? No. I am free not to.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I learned.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><br /> <br /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We all lived through it. But one fun or interesting realizations I came to in reporting the book was... Can we curse on your podcast?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. Anything goes.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“... Is just how much shit happened in the world between 1999 and 2015.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Smith is the author of</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bestseller, “The Daily Show (The Book): An Oral History as Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He interviewed 144 people, including the host Jon Stewart, Craig Kilborn, Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and so many other people.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, Jon Stewart’s a guy who had an upper-middle-</span><em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">ish</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">class upbringing in New Jersey, went to William and Mary, came into comedy sideways. He wasn't sure exactly what he was going to do after college.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I needed to know how Jon Stewart did it. How he redefined Late Night. How he broke out and rose to the top of comedy. And how he used humor to disrupt it all</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">mainstream media, mainstream politics, the news.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He would wear the same thing in the office everyday: a pair of work boots, a pair of chinos, the same t-shirt, the same Mets hat. And well, they’d rag on him about being a slob. There was—and not to get cheaply psychological—something Jon was communicating… He was simplifying a lot of the extraneous stuff and getting to work.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what I learned from Chris Smith about comedy, change and the combination that changed the world:</span></p> <p> </p> <p>1) Ask the right questions</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon showed up every day and asked, “What was in the news? What's funny about it? What's our</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">point of view?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyday, I ask, “Who can I help today?” It keeps me open to the day. It gives me a fresh perspective. That’s part of reinvention.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always looking. Always starting over. Always asking, “What’s missing here?” And then filling that gap.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>2)  Change the format</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon did a “Bush vs. Bush” segment.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First you see a clip of Governor Bush talking about Iraq and saying, “We're not here to nation-build.” Then you see Bush as president saying the complete opposite. "We're going to nation-build in Iraq."</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon didn’t point out the hypocrisy. He could’ve. But that wouldn't have been funny.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he played dumb. He pretended he didn’t know it was the same person contradicting himself.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what made it funny.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He removed knowledge from the situation. And got the attention of millions. Eventually, making real change. They even had an effect on some big issues.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They made an eight or nine-minute mock detective movie. They took one veteran and tried to trace his paperwork through the Veterans Administration. They kept running into ridiculous roadblocks, but it was also moving. It gave you a sense of how much this guy was going through to get medical care,” Chris said. “That ended up shaming the Veterans Administration and changing a lot of those rules and regulations.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also transformed media.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Loosely,” Chris says.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, in old media you couldn’t find the truth like you can today.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p>“We all lived through it. But one fun or interesting realizations I came to in reporting the book was... Can we curse on your podcast?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“Yeah. Anything goes.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“... Is just how much shit happened in the world between 1999 and 2015.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Chris Smith is the author of <em>The New York Times</em> bestseller, “The Daily Show (The Book): An Oral History as Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests.”</p> <p> </p> <p>He interviewed 144 people, including the host Jon Stewart, Craig Kilborn, Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee and so many other people.</p> <p> </p> <p>“You know, Jon Stewart’s a guy who had an upper-middle-<em>ish</em> class upbringing in New Jersey, went to William and Mary, came into comedy sideways. He wasn't sure exactly what he was going to do after college.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I needed to know how Jon Stewart did it. How he redefined Late Night. How he broke out and rose to the top of comedy. And how he used humor to disrupt it all — mainstream media, mainstream politics, the news.</p> <p> </p> <p>“He would wear the same thing in the office everyday: a pair of work boots, a pair of chinos, the same t-shirt, the same Mets hat. And well, they’d rag on him about being a slob. There was—and not to get cheaply psychological—something Jon was communicating… He was simplifying a lot of the extraneous stuff and getting to work.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Here’s what I learned from Chris Smith about comedy, change and the combination that changed the world:</p> <p> </p> <p>1) Ask the right questions</p> <p>Jon showed up every day and asked, “What was in the news? What's funny about it? What's our point of view?”</p> <p> </p> <p>Everyday, I ask, “Who can I help today?” It keeps me open to the day. It gives me a fresh perspective. That’s part of reinvention.</p> <p> </p> <p>Always looking. Always starting over. Always asking, “What’s missing here?” And then filling that gap.</p> <p> </p> <p>2)  Change the format</p> <p>Jon did a “Bush vs. Bush” segment.</p> <p> </p> <p>First you see a clip of Governor Bush talking about Iraq and saying, “We're not here to nation-build.” Then you see Bush as president saying the complete opposite. "We're going to nation-build in Iraq."</p> <p> </p> <p>Jon didn’t point out the hypocrisy. He could’ve. But that wouldn't have been funny.</p> <p> </p> <p>Instead, he played dumb. He pretended he didn’t know it was the same person contradicting himself.</p> <p> </p> <p>That’s what made it funny.</p> <p> </p> <p>He removed knowledge from the situation. And got the attention of millions. Eventually, making real change. They even had an effect on some big issues.</p> <p> </p> <p>“They made an eight or nine-minute mock detective movie. They took one veteran and tried to trace his paperwork through the Veterans Administration. They kept running into ridiculous roadblocks, but it was also moving. It gave you a sense of how much this guy was going through to get medical care,” Chris said. “That ended up shaming the Veterans Administration and changing a lot of those rules and regulations.”</p> <p> </p> <p>He also transformed media.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Loosely,” Chris says.</p> <p> </p> <p>But, in old media you couldn’t find the truth like you can today. It would take weeks of research. Now with the Internet you can search and find anything. And turn it around in 24 hours.</p> <p> </p> <p>Chris talked to Anderson Cooper. He said the mainstream media world was always aware of “The Daily Show.” They didn’t want to get made fun…</p> <p> </p> <p>“And, inevitably, you did.”</p> <p> </p> <p>3) Ignore the traps</p> <p>“You've got, in many cases, a lot of ambitious, competitive, eccentric people,” he said. “You put them in a room and give them a deadline and that can lead to a lot of clashes.” But Jon didn’t get stuck in the trappings of show business.</p> <p> </p> <p>Which is easy to do in any career.  </p> <p> </p> <p>But if you use your idea of how things <em>could</em> be to fuel creation, you get a leg up.</p> <p> </p> <p>You get “The Daily Show.”</p> <p> </p> <p>4) Live in two worlds</p> <p>“What about when you were writing the book? Did you ever wish you were them? Did you ever feel like, ‘I'm covering them, but I want to be them’?”</p> <p> </p> <p>I knew my answer. And Chris’s answer was more or less the same.</p> <p> </p> <p>“No…”</p> <p> </p> <p>“In some fantasy world... sure.”</p> <p>   </p> <p>-</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

I asked him, “What is your one favorite thing that everybody thinks is bad for you that is actually good for you?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn’t want to tell me. “My kids might listen to this later,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he told me...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">H</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">e's the author of "Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation," "Everything Bad is Good for you," and the recent "Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World"— how the idea of "play" more than anything else, is what created the modern world.</span></p> <p>“I regret saying this a little, but, the assumption that video games are just a terrible waste of time and that this generation is growing up playing these stupid games is really… it’s so wrong," he said.</p> <p>He was talking about using play for education reform. "If you think about it, we walk around with a bunch of assumptions of what a learning experience is supposed to look like: listening to a lecture, watching an educational video, taking an exam to test your learning."</p> </div> <p>I was gonna puke. </p> <p>“I’ve been watching my kids play Battlefield 1, which is set in WWI. And it’s amazing.”</p> <div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I sit and watch my kids play and ask what they’re thinking about. Because as a grown up who doesn’t play the game you can’t process it. There’s just so much going on in the world. They’re playing this multiplayer game, in this incredibly vivid landscape with a million data points streaming across the screen.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His doesn't understand it. And his kids don’t understand how he doesn’t understand it...  “Didn’t you see the signal I got? And how this one piece of the interface was telling me to do xy and z?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All I can see is there’s a gun and a Zeplin. I’m 48,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re the same age.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Does that make me middle aged?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re old."</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids are basically gonna destroy us. We’re the one’s who are going to end up in diapers. They started off there, we end up there.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We play, too.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here’s what Steven found out.</span></p> <p>One would ask, that sounds ridiculous: how did "play" create the Industrial Revolution. Or all the wars of the past 500 years. Or all the innovations we've seen with the Internet, which was initially funded by the military. What does "play" have to do with it?</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's what makes Steven Johnson so infuriating. He'll take two concepts that seem like they have nothing to do with each other and he'll say, THIS caused THAT!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I'd shake my head and cry and ask, "How is that even possible?" And then he'll show me.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because he traces his curiosity. It’s like when you start clicking all the hyperlinks in a Wikipedia page. And seeing how everything is connected.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven connects the dots and puts them in a book for you.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I were to recreate a robotic Steven Johnson (hmmm, actually, maybe he is a robot. Or at least has a Cylon brain or maybe Bradley Cooper's brain from Limitless) I'd have to feed in 10,000 books or so, and this ability to find every possible cross connection between every two ideas mentioned in the books.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then he spits it out in his masterpieces.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I told him in the beginning of the podcast: I enjoy a lot of books. A lot of books are great even. But your books and only a few others are among the only books where I read it and I feel like my IQ is going up.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made up a game in fact, based on his books. Maybe someone should make the card game for this.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here's two random concepts. Tell me how they are connected.</span></p> <p>Example<span style="font-weight: 400;">: The lengthening of shop windows in London in the 1600s and the rise of American slavery in the 1800s.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not making this up. One really caused the other.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven calls it “the hummingbird effect.” It’s different from the butterfly effect where the flapping of a butterfly’s wings can cause a hurricane.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s chance.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hummingbird effect is traceable. “It has to be 2-3 steps removed,” he said. “And you have to be really rigorous about when it just doesn’t work.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You play to find the links.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I told him this idea. He laughed and said, "I should do that."</span></p> <p>Example<span style="font-weight: 400;">: The laugh of Sputnik, led direction to Tinder.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the podcast, we spoke about how humans have this evolutionary need not only for food and reproduction (Darwin's well-trodden theories), but also novelty.</span></p> <p>Example<span style="font-weight: 400;">: Gutenberg in the 1400s led to the study of genomics.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that novelty and play gave us energy and initiative to produce discoveries ranging from the cotton gin, the steam engine, world exploration, and the Internet.</span></p> <p>Example<span style="font-weight: 400;">: a tree used by the Mayans to make games led directly to car tires.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I really wanted to explore in the podcast was not only these insane connections. It was almost ludicrous how many fun ones I was coming up with, but what was it about Steven that allowed him to come up with all these connections.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does he do differently with his brain?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can I do it also? I wanted to learn.</span></p> <p>Example<span style="font-weight: 400;">: The invention of the phonograph in the mid 1800s directly led to their being more boys than girls born in China this year.</span></p> </div>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 205 - Jairek Robbins: What To Do When You're Overworked, Tired and Can't Turn Off Your Mind</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You know that game where you flip a card, see the face and turn it back over, then try to find the match?</p> <p> </p> <p>That's the game we're going to play...</p> <p> </p> <p>Write down your values. I told Jairek mine. I had three.</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek is a life coach. And Tony Robbins is his dad. But that doesn’t matter. Because Tony didn’t invest in his son’s strengths. He invested in weakness.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I didn’t really have an understanding of what real hard work was,” Jairek said.</p> <p> </p> <p>So in college, Jairek went to Canada and stacked lumber.</p> <p> </p> <p>“You’ve known me a long time,” I said. “What’s a weakness I have that you think I can work through?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“I’ll tell you how we find those,” he said.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 1: Review your values</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek said, “Let’s do this right now. If I were to ask you what’s most important to you in life, what would you say?”</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li>“Humans…” That was number one. Connecting with people I care about.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start="2"> <li>“Being an honest person who acts with integrity.”</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start="3"> <li>“And creativity.”</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>So here’s the card game… Imagine you have all the cards face down on the carpet. Every card has a match.</p> <p> </p> <p>One shows your values. The other shows your time. You have to match them up to win.</p> <p> </p> <p>Because values = time.</p> <p> </p> <p>People say, “Time is money.”</p> <p> </p> <p>No.</p> <p> </p> <p>Time is values.</p> <p> </p> <p>But pretty much everyone struggles with this. I struggle with this. Jairek gave an example but it made me wonder maybe your brain's idea of values is wrong.</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe your “values” are really your expectations… In my life, misery sinks in when expectations are higher than reality.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't know.</p> <p> </p> <p>The example Jairek gave was a guy who spent all his time doing business. His values were family and God. So I asked Jairek, “Could your brain be wrong?”</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe this guy’s calendar was right. Maybe he really valued business…</p> <p> </p> <p>I’m not in his head. I don't’ have a life coach. I have a therapist.</p> <p> </p> <p>So if you're reading this and thinking, "No he doesn’t," then you know what's true for you.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2: Find a match</p> <p> </p> <p>Log your time. Look at your day and your week. Jairek’s clients log their lives for seven days. But he also needs to know your thoughts. Which is harder to measure. “I don’t have a sensor for that yet,” he said. “It’s subjective.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek has helped thousands of people.</p> <p> </p> <p>One client said, “Honestly, I wake up and the first thing through my head is, ‘Am I going to close that deal today?’ It’s always combing through my mind. Even at dinner. I’m thinking about the paperwork. My mind’s constantly turning. I’m not able to let go of what’s going on.’”</p> <p> </p> <p>His home life was suffering.</p> <p> </p> <p>So Jairek asked, “What’s your ritual to turn it off at the end of the day and walk away without having all those thoughts processing in your head?”</p> <p> </p> <p>Most people don’t have a ritual. That’s the problem. “You need to disassociate from work,” he said. “Get it out of your nervous system.”</p> <p> </p> <p>So here’s the formula: disconnect, then connect.</p> <p> </p> <p>Part A) Disconnect:</p> <p> </p> <p>“Some people go for a walk, other people breathe for 20 minutes. It’s different for everybody. You have to figure out the routine.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes I’m emailing about work at midnight. That’s how habits start. They creep in when my guard is down, when I’m not connected to anything I love.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Part B) Connect</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek switched his coaching methods a few years ago. He used to coach on performance. Now it’s relationships. Because it’s the relationships in our lives that increase our performance.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Right now, if you’re at work, and you think about your kids, your heart’s probably not gushing over them,” he said.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“No, usually they suck and I’m annoyed at them.” I had plans to see them in a few hours.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then Jairek hypnotized me.</p> <p> </p> <p>“What’s the most precious and beautiful moment you have with one of your kids?” he said. “Go back way in the distance. Remember one of your earliest moments with them that just lit your heart up. And as a dad made you prouder than you could have ever imagined.”</p> <p> </p> <p>He had me repeat the process. Catch a memory. Then another. You can do this about your spouse, family, someone who’s hurt your or you’ve hurt.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then combine memories with music. Or look at a picture. “If you combine the visual, auditory and the feeling of it, and reconnect with those memories, then by the time you get home, you’re less likely to pick up a business call. Because your head’s not thinking about all the deals.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I saw my kids that day. We laughed more than ever…</p> <p> </p> <p>And when I flipped the cards, I found a match.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that game where you flip a card, see the face and turn it back over, then try to find the match?</p> <p> </p> <p>That's the game we're going to play...</p> <p> </p> <p>Write down your values. I told Jairek mine. I had three.</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek is a life coach. And Tony Robbins is his dad. But that doesn’t matter. Because Tony didn’t invest in his son’s strengths. He invested in weakness.</p> <p> </p> <p>“I didn’t really have an understanding of what real hard work was,” Jairek said.</p> <p> </p> <p>So in college, Jairek went to Canada and stacked lumber.</p> <p> </p> <p>“You’ve known me a long time,” I said. “What’s a weakness I have that you think I can work through?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“I’ll tell you how we find those,” he said.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 1: Review your values</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek said, “Let’s do this right now. If I were to ask you what’s most important to you in life, what would you say?”</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li>“Humans…” That was number one. Connecting with people I care about.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start="2"> <li>“Being an honest person who acts with integrity.”</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start="3"> <li>“And creativity.”</li> </ol> <p> </p> <p>So here’s the card game… Imagine you have all the cards face down on the carpet. Every card has a match.</p> <p> </p> <p>One shows your values. The other shows your time. You have to match them up to win.</p> <p> </p> <p>Because values = time.</p> <p> </p> <p>People say, “Time is money.”</p> <p> </p> <p>No.</p> <p> </p> <p>Time is values.</p> <p> </p> <p>But pretty much everyone struggles with this. I struggle with this. Jairek gave an example but it made me wonder maybe your brain's idea of values is wrong.</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe your “values” are really your expectations… In my life, misery sinks in when expectations are higher than reality.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't know.</p> <p> </p> <p>The example Jairek gave was a guy who spent all his time doing business. His values were family and God. So I asked Jairek, “Could your brain be wrong?”</p> <p> </p> <p>Maybe this guy’s calendar was right. Maybe he really valued business…</p> <p> </p> <p>I’m not in his head. I don't’ have a life coach. I have a therapist.</p> <p> </p> <p>So if you're reading this and thinking, "No he doesn’t," then you know what's true for you.</p> <p> </p> <p>Step 2: Find a match</p> <p> </p> <p>Log your time. Look at your day and your week. Jairek’s clients log their lives for seven days. But he also needs to know your thoughts. Which is harder to measure. “I don’t have a sensor for that yet,” he said. “It’s subjective.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek has helped thousands of people.</p> <p> </p> <p>One client said, “Honestly, I wake up and the first thing through my head is, ‘Am I going to close that deal today?’ It’s always combing through my mind. Even at dinner. I’m thinking about the paperwork. My mind’s constantly turning. I’m not able to let go of what’s going on.’”</p> <p> </p> <p>His home life was suffering.</p> <p> </p> <p>So Jairek asked, “What’s your ritual to turn it off at the end of the day and walk away without having all those thoughts processing in your head?”</p> <p> </p> <p>Most people don’t have a ritual. That’s the problem. “You need to disassociate from work,” he said. “Get it out of your nervous system.”</p> <p> </p> <p>So here’s the formula: disconnect, then connect.</p> <p> </p> <p>Part A) Disconnect:</p> <p> </p> <p>“Some people go for a walk, other people breathe for 20 minutes. It’s different for everybody. You have to figure out the routine.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Sometimes I’m emailing about work at midnight. That’s how habits start. They creep in when my guard is down, when I’m not connected to anything I love.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Part B) Connect</p> <p> </p> <p>Jairek switched his coaching methods a few years ago. He used to coach on performance. Now it’s relationships. Because it’s the relationships in our lives that increase our performance.</p> <p> </p> <p>“Right now, if you’re at work, and you think about your kids, your heart’s probably not gushing over them,” he said.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“No, usually they suck and I’m annoyed at them.” I had plans to see them in a few hours.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then Jairek hypnotized me.</p> <p> </p> <p>“What’s the most precious and beautiful moment you have with one of your kids?” he said. “Go back way in the distance. Remember one of your earliest moments with them that just lit your heart up. And as a dad made you prouder than you could have ever imagined.”</p> <p> </p> <p>He had me repeat the process. Catch a memory. Then another. You can do this about your spouse, family, someone who’s hurt your or you’ve hurt.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then combine memories with music. Or look at a picture. “If you combine the visual, auditory and the feeling of it, and reconnect with those memories, then by the time you get home, you’re less likely to pick up a business call. Because your head’s not thinking about all the deals.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I saw my kids that day. We laughed more than ever…</p> <p> </p> <p>And when I flipped the cards, I found a match.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<title>Ep. 203 - Susan David: What Happens When You're Deeply Stuck In Your Job and Asking, "How Did I Get Here?"</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><br /> <br /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the most commonly believed lie. It will make you lose all your money. It’ll make you wake up in your 40’s or 50’s and wonder what you’re going to do about retirement. It will make you develop your worst possible habits.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, it was drinking. And waking up face to floor. I was ugliest when I was unhappy. That’s true for everyone.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless you hide it with plastic surgery and cocaine.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is I care about myself now. And not a lot of people say that.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s important.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should care about me more than anyone else… even my daughters. But sometimes I mess up. Sometimes I love them more than me.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even on airplanes, they say, “Put your mask on before assisting others.” If you put a mask on your baby before you put a mask on yourself, your baby will never know who you could’ve been.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I don’t put my oxygen mask on first everyday, then my kids, my friends, everyone I meet, won’t know who I really am.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t know me at my best. They’ll know me passed out on the floor because I tried starving myself for three days (it was a fast. I was trying to detox my body. Again this goes back to caring about yourself. Molly, Josie, I swear, I had good intentions.)</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me get back to the most commonly believed lie.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s called the sunk cost fallacy. This is when you stick to what you’re doing because you already invested your whole life in it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, you won’t quit your job (the job you hate) because that’s what you went to college for or because you’ve been doing it for 20 years and change is scary.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I studied computer science. I went to graduate school for it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now I do what I love. Because I gave up.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to give up on life’s little stresses and jump head first into an even bigger stress. It took me one step closer to bottom. And one step closer to the lifeboat.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a friend. She’s 52. Or 53, divorced. She has a “low-level” job. Or that’s what she says.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She thinks her goals are out of reach. She says, “I can’t do it.” And she believes it. So I asked my friend Susan David, (she’s a Ph.D) “How can you help someone like that? How can you help someone struggling with life’s circumstances?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I was asking the wrong question. Because she told me the stress people experience everyday isn’t (usually) caused by massive life events.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a particular kind of stress that, in psychology, we call allostatic stress,” Susan said, “It’s the everyday stress.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was interviewing her about her book, “Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She gave 50 or 100 tips to do exactly what the subtitle of her book says, “Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p>1) Accept it</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accept that you aren’t where you want to be,” Susan said. “Be with those difficult emotions.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said we get stuck in two ways. One is “bottling.” The second is “bruting.” Bottling is when someone traps emotions inside. They ignore their feelings.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruting is when someone obsesses about emotions. And try to determine what happened and why…</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They both cause high levels of anxiety.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I had to stop asking, “Why?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p>2) Choose “want-to” goals</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have four main values. They’re in my daily practice.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Values are the things you want to do versus the things you have to do. Because “have to” goals are less likely to be successful.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked Susan, “What if you don’t know what your values are?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We often turn around and say, ‘How did I get here?’</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just going on with flow. I was just doing what everyone else told me to do. I went to college. I got a job. I got a house... How did I get her?’ This is a really difficult place for people to be” she said. “What’s really critical for all of us to realize is values are not some abstract idea. Values are ways of living, ways of being.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figure out your values. Susan says, at the end of the day ask yourself, “What did I do today that was worthwhile?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched a plane move through the sky today. I held the door for someone. I smiled at someone who looked dangerous… someone who probably isn’t smiled at often.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were worthwhile moments. I’m also writing…</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a “want-to” goal that I hope to have for the rest of my life...  but who knows, sometimes</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinvention has new ideas for you</span></em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>3) Make “towards” moves</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of movements.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything you do is either a “toward” or an “away” movement.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I value my health, I can go downstairs and choose an ice cream, which is an ‘away’ move or I can make a choice that is healthier,” Susan said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>4) Watch for setbacks</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you have a setback you’re more likely to revert back to an old bias you falsely believe,” she said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made an “away” move. I stopped writing my daily gratitude list. And then I started complaining. It was a domino effect. But I caught it early.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Setbacks happen everyday to everyone. I just have to watch for them.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not immune.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Susan about her setbacks. I wanted to know what drove her to this study. “As you can hear from my accent, I didn’t grow up in the U.S.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that was a Brooklyn accent,” I said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was growing up, your chances of learning how to read and write were lower than your chances of being raped,” she said. “So from a very early age, I became interested in how people were dealing or not dealing with the chaos that was going on around them.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan was 25 years old the first time she could safely go for a walk.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s from South Africa. She lived there for 25 years. Then moved to New York.</span></p> <p><br /> <br /></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">--</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve spent a lot of time trying to get rid of stress. But I spent more building it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lie we all believe is that you have to stick with it. You can’t quit. You are what you are.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s not true.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are what you choose to be tomorrow.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chose to be a writer, podcaster, father, angel investor, interrupter, chess master. I chose not to be a computer scientist or to walk the streets of NY waiting for a coconut to save my life.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan called it “the physics of willpower”… It’s when you finally decide your investments are failing you.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people feel deeply stuck in their lives. I have, too. But the way out begins when you accept what you really want: reinvention.</span></p>]]></description>

Because she told me the stress people experience everyday isn’t (usually) caused by massive life events.</p> <p> </p> <p>“There’s a particular kind of stress that, in psychology, we call allostatic stress,” Susan said, “It’s the everyday stress.”</p> <p> </p> <p>I was interviewing her about her book, “Emotional Agility: Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.”</p> <p> </p> <p>She gave 50 or 100 tips to do exactly what the subtitle of her book says, “Get Unstuck, Embrace Change, and Thrive in Work and Life.”</p> <p> </p> <p>1) Accept it</p> <p>“Accept that you aren’t where you want to be,” Susan said. “Be with those difficult emotions.”</p> <p> </p> <p>She said we get stuck in two ways. One is “bottling.” The second is “bruting.” Bottling is when someone traps emotions inside. They ignore their feelings.</p> <p> </p> <p>Bruting is when someone obsesses about emotions. And try to determine what happened and why…</p> <p> </p> <p>They both cause high levels of anxiety.</p> <p> </p> <p>So I had to stop asking, “Why?”</p> <p> </p> <p>2) Choose “want-to” goals</p> <p>I have four main values. They’re in my daily practice.</p> <p> </p> <p>Values are the things you want to do versus the things you have to do. Because “have to” goals are less likely to be successful.</p> <p> </p> <p>So I asked Susan, “What if you don’t know what your values are?”</p> <p> </p> <p>“We often turn around and say, ‘How did I get here?’</p> <p> </p> <p>“I was just going on with flow. I was just doing what everyone else told me to do. I went to college. I got a job. I got a house... How did I get her?’ This is a really difficult place for people to be” she said. “What’s really critical for all of us to realize is values are not some abstract idea. Values are ways of living, ways of being.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Figure out your values. Susan says, at the end of the day ask yourself, “What did I do today that was worthwhile?”</p> <p> </p> <p>I watched a plane move through the sky today. I held the door for someone. I smiled at someone who looked dangerous… someone who probably isn’t smiled at often.</p> <p> </p> <p>Those were worthwhile moments. I’m also writing…</p> <p> </p> <p>It’s a “want-to” goal that I hope to have for the rest of my life...  but who knows, sometimes <em>reinvention has new ideas for you</em>.</p> <p> </p> <p>3) Make “towards” moves</p> <p>There are two types of movements.</p> <p> </p> <p>Everything you do is either a “toward” or an “away” movement.</p> <p> </p> <p>“If I value my health, I can go downstairs and choose an ice cream, which is an ‘away’ move or I can make a choice that is healthier,” Susan said.</p> <p> </p> <p>4) Watch for setbacks</p> <p>“When you have a setback you’re more likely to revert back to an old bias you falsely believe,” she said.</p> <p> </p> <p>I made an “away” move. I stopped writing my daily gratitude list. And then I started complaining. It was a domino effect. But I caught it early.</p> <p> </p> <p>Setbacks happen everyday to everyone. I just have to watch for them.</p> <p> </p> <p>I’m not immune.</p> <p> </p> <p>I asked Susan about her setbacks. I wanted to know what drove her to this study. “As you can hear from my accent, I didn’t grow up in the U.S.”</p> <p> </p> <p>“I thought that was a Brooklyn accent,” I said.</p> <p> </p> <p>“When I was growing up, your chances of learning how to read and write were lower than your chances of being raped,” she said. “So from a very early age, I became interested in how people were dealing or not dealing with the chaos that was going on around them.”</p> <p> </p> <p>Susan was 25 years old the first time she could safely go for a walk.</p> <p> </p> <p>She’s from South Africa. She lived there for 25 years. Then moved to New York.</p> <p> </p> <p>--</p> <p> </p> <p>I’ve spent a lot of time trying to get rid of stress. But I spent more building it.</p> <p> </p> <p>The lie we all believe is that you have to stick with it. You can’t quit. You are what you are.</p> <p> </p> <p>But that’s not true.</p> <p> </p> <p>You are what you choose to be tomorrow.</p> <p> </p> <p>I chose to be a writer, podcaster, father, angel investor, interrupter, chess master. I chose not to be a computer scientist or to walk the streets of NY waiting for a coconut to save my life.</p> <p> </p> <p>Susan called it “the physics of willpower”… It’s when you finally decide your investments are failing you.</p> <p> </p> <p>A lot of people feel deeply stuck in their lives. I have, too. But the way out begins when you accept what you really want: reinvention.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Kamal was totally lost. His father had died. His job over. His relationship gone. He felt adrift, depressed, broken.</p> <p>He was so lost he wandered the world trying to find his way back.</p> <p>Twenty years later he wrote the novel about what happened - REBIRTH.</p> <p>The novel is about how he discovered for himself the ancient art of the pilgrimage. How to be a wanderer.</p> <p>How to be lost in a world with too much GPS raining down.</p> <p>Would a pilgrimage, a wandering, solve his problems?</p> <p>I read Kamal's book. The book comes out today. I had him on my podcast (also out today). I wanted to find out how even in our daily lives we can go on a pilgrimage.</p> <p>Even if I'm in a cubicle, can I break free, can I become a wanderer</p> <p>Sometimes I also feel stuck. But I don't want to go away for months at a time. I want a pilgrimage in my life right now!</p> <p>From what I can gather from reading the book, REBIRTH, and talking with Kamal, a pilgrimage has several parts:</p> <p>A) SEEKING AN ANSWER</p> <p>Something happened. Something confusing. Something that wasn't in the plan.</p> <p>You have to get off the regular path. Try a new one. Try one that takes a bit of courage and discipline. To meet stranger along the way</p> <p>B) IT TAKES TiME</p> <p>I'm not a believer that you have to go to a far location.</p> <p>But take time for yourself each day to do something you've never done before. Think about things you never thought about before.</p> <p>Find the places in your life that you never looked before. They are there every day. The pilgrimage awaits.</p> <p>Do a dare you never would have dared to before.</p> <p>C) STRUGGLE</p> <p>Maybe some people find life easy. I don't.</p> <p>Life is filled with worries about money, about relationships, about (for me) kids, about decisions, about the people who hate you, who annoy you, who scare you. Anxieties, regrets.</p> <p>Every pilgrimage begins with the struggle. And every journey is a struggle.</p> <p>The struggle doesn't stop. It just changes. It changes into one where you are lost to one where you have vision.</p> <p>Where the struggle is not being trapped in the vision of others but for the unique impact that you want to create.</p> <p>D) BENEFITS OF A PILGRIMAGE:</p> <p>- You see more clearly: Everything you see on a pilgrimage is different from "normal life". Enjoy them. Learn from it. Even a single day, a single meeting, can be a pilgrimage. What is your takeaway from it.</p> <p>- You meet people. I like to pretend everyone has a fortune cookie to give me. A little bit stale, a little bit crunchy, with a folded message inside. Read it.</p> <p>- There's an end. We've made pilgrimages too easy. We can go to a museum and see 2000 works of art.</p> <p>It used to be that people would travel a 1000 miles to see one painting hanging up in a chapel. Then you can really appreciate what you see.</p> <p>The more you appreciate the people, the things, the emotions around you, the more you are a pilgrim.</p> <p>- Come back changed. A pilgrim doesn't just fly a plane from LA to NY. A pilgrim changes because of the journey. You do that by using your senses: listen more, see more, taste more, observe more.</p> <p>The convenience of modern society comes at a price. It's too difficult now to be a pilgrim because everything is two taps away on our phone.</p> <p>There is an "otherness" to being disconnected for a bit. To search. To wander.</p> <p>And finally, to give up looking. To surrender to the results.</p> <p>----</p> <p>It's freeing to give up, even for a few minutes, everything you ever knew. To become a Wanderer.</p> <p>To look around and see everything as if it were new.</p> <p>REBIRTH, by Kamal Ravikant, got me thinking about these things. He went on his pilgrimage. He met people.

			<title>Ep. 201 - Ben Mezrich: Success after 190 Rejection Slips</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I was a struggling writer, before I wrote my first book, I got 190 rejection slips.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He taped them to the walls like a serial killer.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My wallpaper was rejection slips.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What was the worst one...,” I asked Ben Mezrich, a New York Times bestselling author. Over the past five or six years, I’ve probably read all of his books. He wrote “Bringing Down the House,” which became the movie “21”. He wrote, “Accidental Billionaires,” which became “The Social Network” where Jesse Eisenberg played a seemingly evil Mark Zuckerberg.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Yorker sent him just a page with the most powerful word known to man.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was just, ‘No,’” Ben said, “I was rejected by a janitor at a publishing house because I sent a manuscript to an editor who was no longer working there and the manuscript ended up in the trash can. A janitor took it out of the trash, read it and sent me a rejection letter.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was his big chance. Not Ben’s.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The janitor.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve never wanted to write a book,” Ben said. “I wanted to write. I wanted to write a hundred books.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was interviewing him about, “The 37th Parallel: The Secret Truth Behind America's UFO Highway.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They found these cows in the 70s. It looked like they were sliced with a laser. They had perfect slices of circles in their abdomens. Like pancakes. And they were completely drained of blood.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI investigated.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no mess. No blood spill.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then pilots started seeing UFOs. Ben says if a pilot sees a UFO now, they’ll get fired for reporting it.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I asked him, “Isn’t there a freedom of information act?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ve tried,” he said. “But they didn’t even admit Area 51 existed until a few years ago. So, no. They don’t have to release that information.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People lose their minds looking for answers. Questioning can be interrogative or art. Answers birth more questions. And the space between answer A and question B is just space.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s where Ben’s books are created.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I only go into the stories where it’s larger than life or something happens,” Ben said. “What leads up to that incredible moment? What leads up to Facebook being a billion dollar company or what leads up to a guy suddenly believing in UFOs?”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked about his writing process. And selling process.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I write by page not by time,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he’s writing a 300 page book, he does this:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: introduce characters</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: introduce love interest</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 3: introduce what they’re trying to achieve / their goal (You’re starting off with the obstacles.)</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s part 1.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 4: “At the end of 100 pages something happens -- something that makes it very difficult for the characters to achieve their goal.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben said, “When I’m interviewing people, I’m thinking of their lives as chapters.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interviewing is part of Ben’s writing, but it’s also part of his selling process. He won’t write a book that won’t sell.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How do you know?” I asked.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Usually, I speak to the main character enough to get a book proposal,” he said. “Then I do all that research. Then I do an outline (very specific, in fact, I know how many pages each chapter is. It’s like a skeleton. It’s very severe.)”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dreams don’t have skeletons.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They usually look like boneless blobs or liquid sliding downstream. Direction over details. That’s what Scott Adams, the creator of the Dilbert told me.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get stuck because I want to do everything at once. I want to read every book, go for a walk, fly around New York City, interview Carly Simon, Edward Thorpe, Carrie Fisher (who I’m sad I missed sharing her stories with you… we were going to meet when she returned from the UK). I want to spend time with my daughters, begin and win at all my dreams, but I also want to do nothing.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes I get so worked up dreaming of the millions of directions I could fly that I forget to take off.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s ok.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I have something to write about. I have a connection with you. Something to share. Something that makes us the same kind of human: ambitious, terrified, curious.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to be all in.</span></p> <p><br /> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to be creatures of resilience.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How can you use mass hypnosis to control 60,000,000 people so they vote for you to become the leader of the world?</p> <p>Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, knows the answer and has known it for years.</p> <p>So I called him and asked. I needed to know. He told me how Trump won. And he told me how anyone can use these persuasion techniques to improve their lives.</p> <p>What if you can get people to do whatever you want just by using the right words and subtly hypnotizing everyone you meet?</p> <p>It sounds like a science fiction novel. But it's true. It's what happened, and it happens every day. Who are the victims? You're the victim.</p> <p>Scott Adams predicted in September 2015(!) that Donald Trump would become President because, "he is the best master persuader I have ever seen."</p> <p>Scott Adams trained as a hypnotist and master persuader for years.</p> <p>"Once you realize that everyone is completely irrational," Scott Adams told me, "your life gets a lot easier.</p> <p>"You can start to use the principles behind this to see why people really do things, as opposed to using rational facts, and then use that to your advantage.</p> <p>"Understanding that people are irrational has made my life a lot better."</p> <p>But how did he predict a year and a half ago that Trump would win? I needed to know how. And how I could do it.</p> <p>Trump was the unlikely choice to be President. Just like Scott was the unlikely choice to be one of the world's most popular cartoonists with Dilbert.</p> <p>But we can all learn the skills that Scott learned.</p> <p>Scott heard a story that made him want to change his life in his 20s. His mother had delivered birth to his sister without the use of anesthetics.</p> <p>She was hypnotized. "She felt no pain," Scott said.</p> <p>So Scott, in his 20s, learned all the techniques of hypnosis.</p> <p>"You mean," I said, "You can take a gold watch and swing it in front of their eyes and make them do what you want?"</p> <p>"That has never happened," Scott said, "Except in movies.</p> <p>"What you learn is that basically everything people do is completely irrational. And then they rationalize it later.</p> <p>"Like, they might say they voted for Trump because of his policies but this is just a rationalization. Everyone is irrational and everyone is subject to persuasion."</p> <p>Everything seemed against Trump. But somehow he beat 16 candidates in the primaries and one big candidate in the election.</p> <p>And, Scott says, all the theories as to why he won have been wrong.</p> <p>So I called him up and asked him what happened. And he told me:</p> <p>-----------------</p> <p>- THE LINGUISTIC KILL SHOT</p> <p>"Trump described everyone using two techniques:<br /> - words that had never been used in politics before<br /> - words that were visual. So every time you looked at the candidate being described you would look for confirmation bias."</p> <p>Example: Jeb Bush he described as "low energy". "Low energy" had never been used to describe a candidate before so they stood out.</p> <p>And whenever you looked Jeb, unless he was jumping around, you would automatically look for clues that showed he was low energy.</p> <p>Trump systematically did this with everyone who was frontrunner against him, including "Crooked Hillary" which referred both to her legal troubles and the persistent rumors that she was sick.</p> <p>------------------</p> <p>- CHARISMA = POWER + EMPATHY</p> <p>Scott said, "Trump clearly had the Power part down. But he was low on Empathy.</p> <p>"So he used polling to figure out what the critical issue was for the most amount of people and came up with Immigration. By going with this issue he proved he had empathy with his base.</p> <p>"Expect him as President to try to show empathy to a much larger group of people."</p> <p>------------------</p> <p>- OVERSELLING THE STORY</p> <p>"Trump consistently oversold his point. For instance, 'Build a Wall'."</p> <p>He used hyperbole because it's the direction that counts.</p> <p>"It didn't matter that the facts didn't support him. His base was listening to the direction while all the media was getting bogged down in the weeds.</p> <p>"And in many cases, he would back down. He would recognize if he oversold too much and back down on it.</p> <p>"But again, the media would show his views for free because he was so outlandish and his supporters would note the direction, not the facts."</p> <p>I asked Scott: What would happen to Trump if a "Rick Perry" situation occurred like in 2012, where Perry couldn't name the 3 cabinet departments he wanted to eliminate and that destroyed his campaign?</p> <p>Scott said, "If Trump was stumbling to name the three he would just say, 'You know what? There are 10 cabinet positions I'd eliminate! You probably can guess the ones I'm talking about."</p> <p>"And then while everyone would be scratching their heads trying to figure out if there are even ten cabinet departments, his supporters would be just note the direction."</p> <p>--------------------</p> <p>- AUDACITY</p> <p>Early on he would say things that were so audacious nobody could believe a Presidential candidate would be saying these things.</p> <p>But people got used to it. It got him free media coverage which allowed him to spend less than half of what Hillary spent.</p> <p>It allowed him to consistently say audacious and outlandish things throughout the campaign without upsetting his base.</p> <p>-----------------</p> <p>- EMBRACE THE ARGUMENT</p> <p>If you just outright reject someone, they won't even pay attention to what you say.</p> <p>But with everyone he spoke with, he would start off agreeing with them and then start to turn people towards supporting his ideas.</p> <p>Even with Hillary, he would say: "She has great experience" before following it up with, "but after 30 years, what has changed?"</p> <p>---------------------</p> <p>- TALENT STACK</p> <p>Scott said, "I'm not the funniest guy in the room. And I'm not the best at drawing. But I'm pretty good at both and that's where Dilbert comes from.</p> <p>"It's really hard to be the best in the world at one thing," Scott told me, "But if you are 'pretty good' at a bunch of things and use them together, you can succeed.</p> <p>"Trump has one of the best talent stacks I've ever seen. He's not the smartest guy in the room, but he's pretty good at public speaking, business smarts, humor, hiring and firing, politics, etc."</p> <p>Again, he didn't know as much as the other candidates about every political issue.</p> <p>"Expect him to get to know the facts that are important once he is President. But he was pretty good at knowing what was going on and combined that with the other "pretty good" things in his talent stack."</p> <p>-------------------</p> <p>- BLAME OTHERS FOR PEOPLE'S SUFFERING</p> <p>"While Hillary was focusing on 'I'm With Her' and 'Let's make history with the first woman President', Trump was focusing on 'Draining the Swamp' and 'Let's Make America Great Again'.</p> <p>These were much more powerful persuasion messages."</p> <p>---------------</p> <p>DID HILLARY HAVE A CHANCE?</p> <p>How could Hillary have fought better using her own persuasion techniques?</p> <p>"Hillary was running a strong persuasion game in the summer," Scott told me. "She might even have won if she stuck with it."</p> <p>" 'Dangerous Donald' was scary for people. But then her campaign leaked the Billy Bush video and even though it caused Trump to dip in the polls, it wasn't as bad as portraying him as a madman at the nuclear controls. Ironically, that bad news actually helped Trump."</p> <p>----</p> <p>My podcast with Scott comes out later today.</p> <p>I wanted to learn other things from him. Like how can I, or anyone, learn these persuasion techniques.</p> <p>What are the easiest techniques to learn?</p> <p>He told me on the podcast. Plus he was very honest and told me a trick he uses with the women he dates.</p> <p>----</p> <p>Does any of this mean Trump is going to be good or bad?</p> <p>This article isn't about that. It's just about what Trump, and all political candidates, do to win elections. Trump, according to Scott, was just particularly good at it. "The best I've ever seen".</p> <p>----</p> <p>Is it bad that people are irrational? That facts don't matter?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>But it's the reality. Our brains were built to hunt for food in scary and uncertain situations.</p> <p>In our more complex society, we still respond to primitive emotions even if they are now irrational.</p> <p>Do I want to be better at persuading so my life is better? Of course.</p> <p>The reality is: I'm easily influenced and have to constantly remind myself everyone has an agenda all the time.</p> <p>I don't think it matters who is President. There are too many forces at work to check and balance everything.</p> <p>But it does matter how I react, how I build my life day by day. It's my choice (I hope) whether or not I have a good impact on others.</p> <p>Or not. Maybe Scott hypnotized me into writing this.

			<description><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When did you decide to go from being a lawyer to a full-time writer?” I asked Gretchen Rubin.

And I knew that I didn’t.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt pain in my legs. That’s the feeling I had in my body the last time I didn’t love something.

That’s also what she did for fun. “That’s a big tip-off,” she said. “What do you do for fun?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loved talking to prostitutes at HBO. But if I stayed I wouldn’t have my own podcast. I couldn’t talk to anyone I wanted. I was limited to prostitutes. And it wasn’t their fault.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know if it was OK to want a better life. I kept waiting for people to notice the signs. I wanted them to worry about me and encourage me to do what I love.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But each situation is different. And you can’t always ask for advice. Advice is what other people would do if they were you. Not what they actually do as themselves.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We try guiding each other with good intentions… but it’s not the same as choosing yourself.</span></p> <ol> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">B) Be you</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen has 12 commandments of happiness. And the first one is “Be Gretchen” so for me it’d be, ‘‘Be James.” But sometimes I feel really disconnected to myself.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen’s suggestions involve knowing a lot about yourself. So I asked her, “What if I don’t know anything about myself?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is the great question of our lives. ‘What does it mean to be you? Who are you?’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems so easy because you hang out with yourself all day,” she said. “But it’s so easy to get distracted by who you feel you should be... or who you wish you were. Or who other people expect you to be.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s almost like we outsource our personality to everybody around us.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it's OK to stop doing things that should make you feel good, but don’t.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had this weird experience recently,” Gretchen said. “I was at a cocktail party. And some woman, very nice person, was saying ‘Oh I love going skiing with the whole family. It’s a great vacation.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen said it seemed great. But skiing doesn’t appeal to her. At all. “I love the fact that my husband has a knee injury so I never feel like we have to go skiing.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman tried convincing her. She said it’s a beautiful adventure, great for the whole family and everything else.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Twenty minutes later she came back to me with this absolutely stricken expression on her face. And she said, ‘I just realized I don’t like skiing either…’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s an easy, two-step formula for being happier:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Do less of what you don’t like doing</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a list: 10 things you do but don’t like doing. (Unless you don’t like lists…)</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 2: Do more of what you like doing</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come up with all the things you daydream about. What have you always wanted to try but never had time for?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BAM!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you have time. And you’re you.</span></p> <ol> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">C) Use envy</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gretchen was looking through a magazine from her college. She read about the other lawyers. And felt mildly interested.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then she saw people with writing jobs.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt sick with envy,” she said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Envy is painful, but it’s a very helpful emotion for a happy life. It’s a giant red arrow sign standing over someone’s head saying, ‘They’ve got something you want.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve learned there are three types of self-help books. One is you’re telling people what to do. The other is scientists are telling people what to do and the third is you’re telling people what you did.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve interviewed hundreds of people. I always ask how they knew what to do next.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how they knew where to find joy...</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that's the myth of happiness.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>HOW TO GO FROM AMATEUR TO TURNING PRO?</p> <p>I had a full time job. I was trying to run a business on the side. I was pitching two TV shows. And I was obsessively playing chess day and night and traveling to tournaments.</p> <p>And nothing was going well. My attention was scattered. I was unhappy. I felt stuck.</p> <p>One time I was talking to one of the partners in my side business, Randy Weiner. I said to him, "I'm reading this fascinating book about chess endgames".</p> <p>He said, "I don't care about that! Why are you even looking at those books? Chess is a game for kids. You should be working at this business full-time."</p> <p>The next day I quit my job. I joined the business full time. I never played in another chess tournament ever again. I stopped pitching TV shows.</p> <p>I went from being an amateur to being a pro.</p> <p>Which is why I'm glad the other day I spoke to Steven Pressfield, author of "Turning Pro", "The War of Art", "The Legend of Bagger Vance", "Do the Work", and more than a dozen other great books and novels.</p> <p>Sometimes it seemed like each new low was lower. And often the highs were higher. But I haven't had a job since.</p> <p>Ever since I made the decision to turn pro, I've been free.</p> <p>It took me two years of asking before Steven finally agreed to do the podcast. I've read all his books twice. But I was still scared to death right before the podcast.</p> <p>Steven and I spoke for two hours about turning pro, writing, how to improve, how to achieve peak performance in any field of life.</p> <p>I wanted to ask questions nobody else would ask him. Two hours later I feel good about it. The podcast is coming out later today.</p> <p>Here is some of what we spoke about:</p> <p>- HOW TO DEAL WITH THE DEMONS</p> <p>When I join a gym, I go until I stop going. Then it basically teeters off.</p> <p>I'm an amateur at going to the gym.</p> <p>Every single day I write. If I don't do it for two days in a row I feel physically sick.</p> <p>But so many times I feel bad about what I am working on. Or I feel unsure if I should work on the next book. or try the next new idea.</p> <p>The demons come up. I get blocked. I get frustrated or scared. Will I be a failure? Have I run out of ideas?</p> <p>Steven wrote several books about these very demons.</p> <p>Steven said, "those thoughts are 'the Resistance'.</p> <p>"Every time you want to go from a lower level to a higher level - becoming an entrepreneur., get in better shape, meditate, be an artist - the Resistance will ALWAYS attack. Every writer or entrepreneur feels the Resistance every day."</p> <p>Recognize each thought as it comes up, he said. Identify the thoughts that are the resistance. Say, 'that's the resistance".</p> <p>"There's no way to get rid of The Resistance. Be aware of it. Say to yourself, these thoughts won't help me achieve my dreams."</p> <p>- KEEP THE EGO OUT</p> <p>A friend of mine started a company once. It was clearly a bad idea. But he thought it was a homerun.</p> <p>This is a cognitive bias. We tend to believe that if we pour our heart and soul into someone (our personal "investment") then it's a good idea.</p> <p>When I do something I have to constantly stop and ask if I'm smoking my own crack.</p> <p>One time I made a website I thought was brilliant. It had an IQ test on it. And it was a dating site. And it would tell you if you were smart or stupid and you can then date people and know their intelligence.</p> <p>I thought it was brilliant!</p> <p>My six year old daughter told me, "Isn't this kind of mean?"</p> <p>My daughter refused to light my crack pipe.</p> <p>Steven told me he had to make sure with his most recent novel, the autobiographical "The Knowledge" that he had to keep his ego out of it. "I had to put some distance between myself and the writing because it was about my early struggles as a writer."</p> <p>- EVEN A PORN DIRECTOR CAN BE A MENTOR:</p> <p>Steven told me about how he switched from writing bad novels to going into screenwriting, to finally getting back to writing novels.</p> <p>It's important to keep switching around, to pursue every angle of an interest. To take away a lesson from every area.</p> <p>Along the way he met a director of porn movies that wanted Steven to write some scenes.</p> <p>"He told me two things:</p> <p>A) don't make a sex scene just about having sex. Make sure it advances the story. Like the detective is having sex with someone and spots a clue.</p> <p>B) Always have something else happening so they can cut back and forth. Like a wife is cheating with the carpenter but the husband is coming home and she doesn't realize and the camera cuts back and forth.</p> <p>That took me to a new level in my fiction writing."</p> <p>The porn director was a mini-mentor. Other writers he admired were virtual mentors. Editors, agents, other directors and writers also became mentors. Learn from everyone.</p> <p>- FEAR OF SUCCESS IS REAL</p> <p>I said, "I don't believe that 'fear of success' is a thing. Is it?"</p> <p>Steven said, "Absolutely. In fact, maybe it's the biggest fear people have that prevents them from turning pro.</p> <p>"To be successful you have to give up a lot. There's a lot of sacrifice. You are tied to what you dedicate yourself to, and you have to get better and better at it. There's no stopping."</p> <p>"What did you sacrifice?"</p> <p>"Everything," he said. "I write every day. I will write until the day I die."</p> <p>I asked him again what he had sacrificed. We were sitting in his home where he lives on his own. He looked out past me, looking out at the amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. "Everything."</p> <p>- EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THE HERO IN THEIR STORY</p> <p>"The arc of the hero" is a structure that is at the heart of every story," Steven told me. "But it's also the arc of your own personal story. Pay attention to it in your life."</p> <p>The 'arc of the hero' is from work by Joseph Campbell and, earlier, from Jung, that is the primal structure of almost every story.</p> <p>It's the arc of Harry Potter, Star Wars, the story of Jesus, and every great story you can think of.</p> <p>"If someone is sitting in their office, wondering how to make use of the potential they know they have, this is their arc also."</p> <p>- the hero is feeling stuck, but feels he/she has a destiny<br /> - there is a call to action. An opportunity to become better and enter a new world.<br /> - a mentor (real or virtual) appears to help the hero enter the new world once he chooses to do so.<br /> - the hero meets new allies and even enemies.<br /> - problems get worse and worse until all seems lost<br /> - the hero gets what he wants<br /> - and, finally, the hero has to return home, a changed person, but this return home is also beset with challenges.</p> <p>We enjoy movies and stories best when they have this structure.</p> <p>But our lives are also stories. Make sure you become the hero of your story. You can have many stories in your life, not just one.</p> <p>We all feel stuck or frustrated at some point.</p> <p>Find a destiny, find mentors, meet your new friends, confront the obstacles, return home a changed person.</p> <p>Repeat.</p> <p>Now you are the pro. Now you are the hero.</p>]]></description>

Have I run out of ideas?</p> <p>Steven wrote several books about these very demons.</p> <p>Steven said, "those thoughts are 'the Resistance'.</p> <p>"Every time you want to go from a lower level to a higher level - becoming an entrepreneur., get in better shape, meditate, be an artist - the Resistance will ALWAYS attack. Every writer or entrepreneur feels the Resistance every day."</p> <p>Recognize each thought as it comes up, he said. Identify the thoughts that are the resistance. Say, 'that's the resistance".</p> <p>"There's no way to get rid of The Resistance. Be aware of it. Say to yourself, these thoughts won't help me achieve my dreams."</p> <p>- KEEP THE EGO OUT</p> <p>A friend of mine started a company once. It was clearly a bad idea. But he thought it was a homerun.</p> <p>This is a cognitive bias. We tend to believe that if we pour our heart and soul into someone (our personal "investment") then it's a good idea.</p> <p>When I do something I have to constantly stop and ask if I'm smoking my own crack.</p> <p>One time I made a website I thought was brilliant. It had an IQ test on it. And it was a dating site. And it would tell you if you were smart or stupid and you can then date people and know their intelligence.</p> <p>I thought it was brilliant!</p> <p>My six year old daughter told me, "Isn't this kind of mean?"</p> <p>My daughter refused to light my crack pipe.</p> <p>Steven told me he had to make sure with his most recent novel, the autobiographical "The Knowledge" that he had to keep his ego out of it. "I had to put some distance between myself and the writing because it was about my early struggles as a writer."</p> <p>- EVEN A PORN DIRECTOR CAN BE A MENTOR:</p> <p>Steven told me about how he switched from writing bad novels to going into screenwriting, to finally getting back to writing novels.</p> <p>It's important to keep switching around, to pursue every angle of an interest. To take away a lesson from every area.</p> <p>Along the way he met a director of porn movies that wanted Steven to write some scenes.</p> <p>"He told me two things:</p> <p>A) don't make a sex scene just about having sex. Make sure it advances the story. Like the detective is having sex with someone and spots a clue.</p> <p>B) Always have something else happening so they can cut back and forth. Like a wife is cheating with the carpenter but the husband is coming home and she doesn't realize and the camera cuts back and forth.</p> <p>That took me to a new level in my fiction writing."</p> <p>The porn director was a mini-mentor. Other writers he admired were virtual mentors. Editors, agents, other directors and writers also became mentors. Learn from everyone.</p> <p>- FEAR OF SUCCESS IS REAL</p> <p>I said, "I don't believe that 'fear of success' is a thing. Is it?"</p> <p>Steven said, "Absolutely. In fact, maybe it's the biggest fear people have that prevents them from turning pro.</p> <p>"To be successful you have to give up a lot. There's a lot of sacrifice. You are tied to what you dedicate yourself to, and you have to get better and better at it. There's no stopping."</p> <p>"What did you sacrifice?"</p> <p>"Everything," he said. "I write every day. I will write until the day I die."</p> <p>I asked him again what he had sacrificed. We were sitting in his home where he lives on his own. He looked out past me, looking out at the amazing views of the Pacific Ocean. "Everything."</p> <p>- EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THE HERO IN THEIR STORY</p> <p>"The arc of the hero" is a structure that is at the heart of every story," Steven told me. "But it's also the arc of your own personal story. Pay attention to it in your life."</p> <p>The 'arc of the hero' is from work by Joseph Campbell and, earlier, from Jung, that is the primal structure of almost every story.</p> <p>It's the arc of Harry Potter, Star Wars, the story of Jesus, and every great story you can think of.</p> <p>"If someone is sitting in their office, wondering how to make use of the potential they know they have, this is their arc also."</p> <p>- the hero is feeling stuck, but feels he/she has a destiny - there is a call to action. An opportunity to become better and enter a new world. - a mentor (real or virtual) appears to help the hero enter the new world once he chooses to do so. - the hero meets new allies and even enemies. - problems get worse and worse until all seems lost - the hero gets what he wants - and, finally, the hero has to return home, a changed person, but this return home is also beset with challenges.</p> <p>We enjoy movies and stories best when they have this structure.</p> <p>But our lives are also stories. Make sure you become the hero of your story. You can have many stories in your life, not just one.</p> <p>We all feel stuck or frustrated at some point.</p> <p>Find a destiny, find mentors, meet your new friends, confront the obstacles, return home a changed person.</p> <p>Repeat.</p> <p>Now you are the pro. Now you are the hero.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was very late and I was very upset at myself. I had flown three thousand miles. I moved into an Airbnb right next to where Tim was staying.</p> <p>I had written thousands of notes on ripped pieces of paper and stuck them all throughout the book. I had notes written up and around all the margins.</p> <p>I listened to dozens of his podcasts. And I've known him for years. All morning I had jotted down possible questions.</p> <p>And I was late to meet Tim for our podcast. Because the west coast is three hours a way in time travel from the east coast. That's how stupid I am.</p> <p>I rushed over and he was waiting. Tim follows his own advice. He was relaxed. No problems. I apologized, we spoke for awhile, and then started the podcast.</p> <p>Three hours later...not even close to done but we stopped.</p> <p>I want to be a better person in life.</p> <p>I want to be healthier. I want to be more creative. I want to find what is hidden inside of me, dig around, unleash it. I want to find the strength to do that.</p> <p>It's not an easy to thing to do. To scrape the dirt and dust that collects inside of ourselves. To explore. To wander. To create.</p> <p>Tim's book, "Tools of the Titans" is a guidebook for doing the above. And I had a lot of questions.</p> <p>----</p> <p>A few months after I started my podcast in 2014, Tim wrote me and said, "Can I call you and ask you some questions about podcasting".</p> <p>I said sure and he called and we talked for quite awhile. He called many podcasters during this period.</p> <p>Then he started his own podcast. He DOMINATED. All of his guests were amazing.</p> <p>He told me he was getting so much great advice from his guests it was overwhelming. The aftermath of a hailstorm where everything is just glowing and even the air you breathe seems cleansed.</p> <p>But that lasts only a short time until the atmosphere is filled with the everyday pollution of life.</p> <p>So he took a month off, re-listened to all his podcasts, and just for his own use he wrote down the advice he was hearing.</p> <p>"But it was too much," he told me. "I kept writing. It was clearly a book."</p> <p>It's not like any other book he's written. He steps out of the way in many cases, and let's these super-achievers do the talking.</p> <p>He curates their thoughts. They had found the hidden gems inside themselves, and long ago brought them up to share with the world to achieve their successes, and now they documented them with Tim.</p> <p>That's why I flew 3000 miles. I wanted the gems. I wanted answers.</p> <p>----</p> <p>I've had so many ups and downs I try to quantify what works on the way up. What goes wrong on the way down.</p> <p>I try to quantify: what are the steps for reinvention?</p> <p>I wonder: what makes someone break out of mediocrity?</p> <p>About seven months ago I threw out all of my belongings. I gave away or donated to the library about 3000 books. All of my books now are on my kindle.</p> <p>None of the answers were in my things.</p> <p>But now I have one physical book. Tim's. And I plan to keep it.</p> <p>Here are ten things (among many) I learned from the book and from our podcast:</p> <p>"ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP"</p> <p>I'm impressed how Tim did his work before starting a podcast.</p> <p>Starting something new is not about taking risks. Jumping into the unknown, getting out of the comfort zone, doing something scary. It's not about bravery.</p> <p>It's the exact opposite. You can only do so many "new" things in life. So do the work beforehand.</p> <p>He called people up. He learned the craft as much as he could. He talked to people ranging from me to people at Apple.</p> <p>He had initial guests lined up. He had a huge launch. And he told me the other day that he is persistent at getting his guests.</p> <p>One recent guest, he told me, took two years to book. Which was refreshing for me to hear since it often takes me that long or longer to book many guests.</p> <p>Comedian Whitney Cummings told him: "My work is not done on the night of a big standup special. My work was done three months ago. All I have do is show up."</p> <p>Even though I was late for our podcast, I'm glad I showed up.</p> <p>- DOING IS EVERYTHING</p> <p>Derek Sivers told him, "If all we needed was more information, then everyone would be a billionaire with perfect abs."</p> <p>It's the DOING that's difficult.</p> <p>I asked Tim: "there's 700 pages of advice here. How can anyone follow everything? How do you know what will work for you?"</p> <p>Just pick a few things. Pick what resonates with you. Start slowly. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start DO-ing.</p> <p>Dan Ariely once told me something similar. "If you say sorry to someone, even if you don't mean it, even if THEY KNOW you don't mean it, then you still have a better relationship with them a year later compared with people who never say sorry."</p> <p>DOING > THINKING.</p> <p>- BLEED</p> <p>From Morgan Spurlock, the director of "Supersize Me" and many other great documentaries.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid to show your scars".</p> <p>This is not a book about suicide. But Tim shares the time he was considering it. This is not a book about anxiety or depression. But Tim shares his battles with those demons.</p> <p>This book is not just a book of advice, it's a book of Tim's own journey as he tries to make his life better.</p> <p>In the section with Tony Robbins, Tony talks about how he wakes up every morning and writes about what he is anxious about.</p> <p>I find this is very helpful. Instead of complaining to the outside world, you reveal to your inside world what it is you are scared of.</p> <p>When I was talking to Susan David in another podcast, she told me how if you write down your vulnerabilities just ONCE for 20 minutes, then even up to six months later the experimental group showed less signs of stress than the control group.</p> <p>Be vulnerable, write down three anxieties a day. I can't be true to others if I'm not true to myself.</p> <p>- MORNING PAGES</p> <p>Julia Cameron writes about this in the classic book, "The Artists Way". Brian Koppelman, writer of Rounders, Ocean's 13, Billions, etc swears by this technique for increasing his creativity.</p> <p>Many of Tim's guests say the same thing.</p> <p>What are morning pages?</p> <p>Sit down in the morning, write in longhand three pages of garbage without stopping.</p> <p>This uncages the anxious "monkey mind" and puts it on the page. It unleashes any writer's block because you have permission to write total nonsense.</p> <p>It frees the mind for the creativity it needs to do that day.</p> <p>- THE DOUBLE THREAT GUIDE TO BEING SUCCESSFUL</p> <p>When Tim spoke to Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, Scott told him:</p> <p>"I always advise young people to become good public speakers".</p> <p>Anyone can do that, he says, with practice.</p> <p>"Suddenly you're in charge or maybe you are starting your own company. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable." If you are good at public speaking and one other skill, you make yourself more rare and valuable.</p> <p>Before Warren Buffett made one dime of money, he took a Dale Carnegie course on public speaking.</p> <p>After that, he made a dime of money. Or two.</p> <p>- DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO</p> <p>Dan Carlin, host of the super-podcast "Hardcore History" told Tim this.</p> <p>Dan was not a historian, didn't have a PhD, but was fascinated by history.</p> <p>His mother(!) told him, "why don't you do a podcast about the stories you tell here at the dinner table."</p> <p>He told his mother, but I don't have a doctorate."</p> <p>His mother said, "I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories".</p> <p>And now he has the most popular history-based podcast on the planet.</p> <p><a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/kamal" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=871600400" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1">Kamal Ravikant</a>, a past and future guest on my own podcast, told Tim, "If I only did things I was qualified for I'd be pushing a broom somewhere."</p> <p>Schools, corporations, government, parents, friends, want to put you in their own boxes. They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today.</p> <p>But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good.</p> <p>- THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED</p> <p>Kevin Kelly tells tim, "Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely extremely happy,"</p> <p>Three ideas from this:</p> <p>Kevin's idea is that if they are true super fans, you will be able to build a product, charge for it, and they will pay, making you a living. Build a product that makes their lives better.</p> <p>Second idea: Have direct contact with your fans. This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe.</p> <p>Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message.</p> <p>The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in.</p> <p>Start small.</p> <p>Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing. As Seth Godin even says, "Find Ten" if you have to.</p> <p>Because if t's a good idea then ten will tell ten who will tell ten.</p> <p>Book recommendation from this chapter: "Small Giants" by Bo Burlingham, about companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest.</p> <p>- ASK DUMB QUESTIONS</p> <p>This is a common theme throughout the book. Tony Robbins tells Tim, "We are the quality of the questions we ask."</p> <p>And both Alex Blumberg (super podcaster) and Malcolm Gladwell talk about the importance of asking dumb questions.</p> <p>People sometimes criticize me for interrupting guests on my podcasts. I get it.</p> <p>But the reality is: if I don't understand something during the podcast, then when else will I get the chance to understand.</p> <p>Alex Blumberg gives some good ways to start dumb questions:</p> <p>"Tell me about a time when..."<br /> "Tell me about the day when..."<br /> "What were the exact steps that got you to...."<br /> "Describe the conversation when..."</p> <p>And then with a follow up to any answer like, "How did that make you feel?"</p> <p>-- NO COMPLAINING</p> <p>Tracey DiNunzio told Tim a great line which I underlined twice in the book:</p> <p>"When you complain, NOBODY wants to help you":</p> <p>If you only focus what is wrong, then you will bring the people around you down.</p> <p>Be a source of growth for the people around you, so that they can become a source of growth for you.</p> <p>It's the "Honda" theory. If you just bought a Honda, you will suddenly see Hondas all over the road.</p> <p>If all you do is complain, you will only see the scarcity everywhere. And the abundance will leave you in the dust.</p> <p>- DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE SELF-HELP BOOKS</p> <p>This is not quite what was said, but this is my personal takeaway.</p> <p>BJ Novak, a writer from "The Office" for it's entire run and a successful comedian told Tim, "I read the book Daily Rituals and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day early."</p> <p>Instead, BJ spends several hours getting in a good mood. Walking, playing, fooling around, reading newspapers, etc. Getting in a good mood was the surest way to get creative ideas.</p> <p>He takes his own path.</p> <p>BJ's podcast recommendation: "Intelligence Squared".</p> <p>Oh! VERY important lesson from Novak. I'm always stressed that I need to publish every day.</p> <p>I even asked Ice T once: if you stopped doing things, how long would it take for people to forget about you?</p> <p>And he scared me when he answered almost immediately, "Six months".</p> <p>But Novak's advice to Tim was the opposite: "Take as long as you want if you're talented. You'll get their attention again if you have reason to."</p> <p>BOOM!</p> <p>- SAYING NO</p> <p>This came up as a theme in many of Tim's podcasts (including one with me about my book, "The Power of No").</p> <p>When you are young and getting started, say "Yes" to anything. Tim was talking to super-investor Chris Sacca who said, "I'd even show up at meetings where I wasn't invited."</p> <p>But ultimately, so many "inbound" requests come in for your time you have to say "no" to almost all of it.</p> <p>Tim says: "3 to 4 mornings per week I am in "maker" mode until at least 1pm" - creativity without allowing for ANY interruptions.</p> <p>- "WISDOM IS ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN ADVICE"</p> <p>Sam Harris (a prior guest on my podcast as well) told Tim this.</p> <p>I strongly believe this. For a few years I was writing about my "daily practice" that I had used many times when things were at their worst for me.</p> <p>Then in 2015, two really difficult things happened to me. One financial and one in my relationships.</p> <p>Right away I said to myself, "Ok, let's see if this still works".</p> <p>And every night I would check the boxes: Did I improve 1% today physically,, emotionally, mentally, spiritually.</p> <p>Without this, I think I would have died or spun into massive depression both times. I followed my own advice.</p> <p>If you can't do this, then no advice will work. Advice is autobiography.</p> <p>----</p> <p>After the podcast was over, Tim and I spoke for awhile. He gave me advice about my podcast. He gave me advice about my next book. He told me some of the things that didn't make it into the book.</p> <p>Tim strives to increase his creativity. To experiment with new ideas, new formats, new ways to apply his creativity.</p> <p>"Try things as an experiment. Always give yourself an out. Then when something works, double down."</p> <p>I left his place and it was dark. I had spent the past week doing nothing but reading his book and preparing.</p> <p>The last thing Tim suggested, "Think about what advice your future self would give you right now."</p> <p>I thought about it. I went home. Had dinner. Thought more.</p> <p>This is what my 60 year old self should say if he could advise me right now:</p> <p>Care deeply about the work you do today. The future will take care of itself.</p> <p>Oh and, "Don't be late."</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today.</p> <p>But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good.</p> <p>- THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED</p> <p>Kevin Kelly tells tim, "Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely extremely happy,"</p> <p>Three ideas from this:</p> <p>Kevin's idea is that if they are true super fans, you will be able to build a product, charge for it, and they will pay, making you a living. Build a product that makes their lives better.</p> <p>Second idea: Have direct contact with your fans. This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe.</p> <p>Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message.</p> <p>The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in.</p> <p>Start small.</p> <p>Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing. As Seth Godin even says, "Find Ten" if you have to.</p> <p>Because if t's a good idea then ten will tell ten who will tell ten.</p> <p>Book recommendation from this chapter: "Small Giants" by Bo Burlingham, about companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest.</p> <p>- ASK DUMB QUESTIONS</p> <p>This is a common theme throughout the book. Tony Robbins tells Tim, "We are the quality of the questions we ask."</p> <p>And both Alex Blumberg (super podcaster) and Malcolm Gladwell talk about the importance of asking dumb questions.</p> <p>People sometimes criticize me for interrupting guests on my podcasts. I get it.</p> <p>But the reality is: if I don't understand something during the podcast, then when else will I get the chance to understand.</p> <p>Alex Blumberg gives some good ways to start dumb questions:</p> <p>"Tell me about a time when..." "Tell me about the day when..." "What were the exact steps that got you to...." "Describe the conversation when..."</p> <p>And then with a follow up to any answer like, "How did that make you feel?"</p> <p>-- NO COMPLAINING</p> <p>Tracey DiNunzio told Tim a great line which I underlined twice in the book:</p> <p>"When you complain, NOBODY wants to help you":</p> <p>If you only focus what is wrong, then you will bring the people around you down.</p> <p>Be a source of growth for the people around you, so that they can become a source of growth for you.</p> <p>It's the "Honda" theory. If you just bought a Honda, you will suddenly see Hondas all over the road.</p> <p>If all you do is complain, you will only see the scarcity everywhere. And the abundance will leave you in the dust.</p> <p>- DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE SELF-HELP BOOKS</p> <p>This is not quite what was said, but this is my personal takeaway.</p> <p>BJ Novak, a writer from "The Office" for it's entire run and a successful comedian told Tim, "I read the book Daily Rituals and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day early."</p> <p>Instead, BJ spends several hours getting in a good mood. Walking, playing, fooling around, reading newspapers, etc. Getting in a good mood was the surest way to get creative ideas.</p> <p>He takes his own path.</p> <p>BJ's podcast recommendation: "Intelligence Squared".</p> <p>Oh! VERY important lesson from Novak. I'm always stressed that I need to publish every day.</p> <p>I even asked Ice T once: if you stopped doing things, how long would it take for people to forget about you?</p> <p>And he scared me when he answered almost immediately, "Six months".</p> <p>But Novak's advice to Tim was the opposite: "Take as long as you want if you're talented. You'll get their attention again if you have reason to."</p> <p>BOOM!</p> <p>- SAYING NO</p> <p>This came up as a theme in many of Tim's podcasts (including one with me about my book, "The Power of No").</p> <p>When you are young and getting started, say "Yes" to anything. Tim was talking to super-investor Chris Sacca who said, "I'd even show up at meetings where I wasn't invited."</p> <p>But ultimately, so many "inbound" requests come in for your time you have to say "no" to almost all of it.</p> <p>Tim says: "3 to 4 mornings per week I am in "maker" mode until at least 1pm" - creativity without allowing for ANY interruptions.</p> <p>- "WISDOM IS ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN ADVICE"</p> <p>Sam Harris (a prior guest on my podcast as well) told Tim this.</p> <p>I strongly believe this. For a few years I was writing about my "daily practice" that I had used many times when things were at their worst for me.</p> <p>Then in 2015, two really difficult things happened to me. One financial and one in my relationships.</p> <p>Right away I said to myself, "Ok, let's see if this still works".</p> <p>And every night I would check the boxes: Did I improve 1% today physically,, emotionally, mentally, spiritually.</p> <p>Without this, I think I would have died or spun into massive depression both times. I followed my own advice.</p> <p>If you can't do this, then no advice will work. Advice is autobiography.</p> <p>----</p> <p>After the podcast was over, Tim and I spoke for awhile. He gave me advice about my podcast. He gave me advice about my next book. He told me some of the things that didn't make it into the book.</p> <p>Tim strives to increase his creativity. To experiment with new ideas, new formats, new ways to apply his creativity.</p> <p>"Try things as an experiment. Always give yourself an out. Then when something works, double down."</p> <p>I left his place and it was dark. I had spent the past week doing nothing but reading his book and preparing.</p> <p>The last thing Tim suggested, "Think about what advice your future self would give you right now."</p> <p>I thought about it. I went home. Had dinner. Thought more.</p> <p>This is what my 60 year old self should say if he could advise me right now:</p> <p>Care deeply about the work you do today. The future will take care of itself.</p> <p>Oh and, "Don't be late."</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I was very late and I was very upset at myself. I had flown three thousand miles. I moved into an Airbnb right next to where Tim was staying.</p> <p>I had written thousands of notes on ripped pieces of paper and stuck them all throughout the book. I had notes written up and around all the margins.</p> <p>I listened to dozens of his podcasts. And I've known him for years. All morning I had jotted down possible questions.</p> <p>And I was late to meet Tim for our podcast. Because the west coast is three hours a way in time travel from the east coast. That's how stupid I am.</p> <p>I rushed over and he was waiting. Tim follows his own advice. He was relaxed. No problems. I apologized, we spoke for awhile, and then started the podcast.</p> <p>Three hours later...not even close to done but we stopped.</p> <p>I want to be a better person in life.</p> <p>I want to be healthier. I want to be more creative. I want to find what is hidden inside of me, dig around, unleash it. I want to find the strength to do that.</p> <p>It's not an easy to thing to do. To scrape the dirt and dust that collects inside of ourselves. To explore. To wander. To create.</p> <p>Tim's book, "Tools of the Titans" is a guidebook for doing the above. And I had a lot of questions.</p> <p>----</p> <p>A few months after I started my podcast in 2014, Tim wrote me and said, "Can I call you and ask you some questions about podcasting".</p> <p>I said sure and he called and we talked for quite awhile. He called many podcasters during this period.</p> <p>Then he started his own podcast. He DOMINATED. All of his guests were amazing.</p> <p>He told me he was getting so much great advice from his guests it was overwhelming. The aftermath of a hailstorm where everything is just glowing and even the air you breathe seems cleansed.</p> <p>But that lasts only a short time until the atmosphere is filled with the everyday pollution of life.</p> <p>So he took a month off, re-listened to all his podcasts, and just for his own use he wrote down the advice he was hearing.</p> <p>"But it was too much," he told me. "I kept writing. It was clearly a book."</p> <p>It's not like any other book he's written. He steps out of the way in many cases, and let's these super-achievers do the talking.</p> <p>He curates their thoughts. They had found the hidden gems inside themselves, and long ago brought them up to share with the world to achieve their successes, and now they documented them with Tim.</p> <p>That's why I flew 3000 miles. I wanted the gems. I wanted answers.</p> <p>----</p> <p>I've had so many ups and downs I try to quantify what works on the way up. What goes wrong on the way down.</p> <p>I try to quantify: what are the steps for reinvention?</p> <p>I wonder: what makes someone break out of mediocrity?</p> <p>About seven months ago I threw out all of my belongings. I gave away or donated to the library about 3000 books. All of my books now are on my kindle.</p> <p>None of the answers were in my things.</p> <p>But now I have one physical book. Tim's. And I plan to keep it.</p> <p>Here are ten things (among many) I learned from the book and from our podcast:</p> <p>"ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP"</p> <p>I'm impressed how Tim did his work before starting a podcast.</p> <p>Starting something new is not about taking risks. Jumping into the unknown, getting out of the comfort zone, doing something scary. It's not about bravery.</p> <p>It's the exact opposite. You can only do so many "new" things in life. So do the work beforehand.</p> <p>He called people up. He learned the craft as much as he could. He talked to people ranging from me to people at Apple.</p> <p>He had initial guests lined up. He had a huge launch. And he told me the other day that he is persistent at getting his guests.</p> <p>One recent guest, he told me, took two years to book. Which was refreshing for me to hear since it often takes me that long or longer to book many guests.</p> <p>Comedian Whitney Cummings told him: "My work is not done on the night of a big standup special. My work was done three months ago. All I have do is show up."</p> <p>Even though I was late for our podcast, I'm glad I showed up.</p> <p>- DOING IS EVERYTHING</p> <p>Derek Sivers told him, "If all we needed was more information, then everyone would be a billionaire with perfect abs."</p> <p>It's the DOING that's difficult.</p> <p>I asked Tim: "there's 700 pages of advice here. How can anyone follow everything? How do you know what will work for you?"</p> <p>Just pick a few things. Pick what resonates with you. Start slowly. It doesn't matter what you do. Just start DO-ing.</p> <p>Dan Ariely once told me something similar. "If you say sorry to someone, even if you don't mean it, even if THEY KNOW you don't mean it, then you still have a better relationship with them a year later compared with people who never say sorry."</p> <p>DOING > THINKING.</p> <p>- BLEED</p> <p>From Morgan Spurlock, the director of "Supersize Me" and many other great documentaries.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid to show your scars".</p> <p>This is not a book about suicide. But Tim shares the time he was considering it. This is not a book about anxiety or depression. But Tim shares his battles with those demons.</p> <p>This book is not just a book of advice, it's a book of Tim's own journey as he tries to make his life better.</p> <p>In the section with Tony Robbins, Tony talks about how he wakes up every morning and writes about what he is anxious about.</p> <p>I find this is very helpful. Instead of complaining to the outside world, you reveal to your inside world what it is you are scared of.</p> <p>When I was talking to Susan David in another podcast, she told me how if you write down your vulnerabilities just ONCE for 20 minutes, then even up to six months later the experimental group showed less signs of stress than the control group.</p> <p>Be vulnerable, write down three anxieties a day. I can't be true to others if I'm not true to myself.</p> <p>- MORNING PAGES</p> <p>Julia Cameron writes about this in the classic book, "The Artists Way". Brian Koppelman, writer of Rounders, Ocean's 13, Billions, etc swears by this technique for increasing his creativity.</p> <p>Many of Tim's guests say the same thing.</p> <p>What are morning pages?</p> <p>Sit down in the morning, write in longhand three pages of garbage without stopping.</p> <p>This uncages the anxious "monkey mind" and puts it on the page. It unleashes any writer's block because you have permission to write total nonsense.</p> <p>It frees the mind for the creativity it needs to do that day.</p> <p>- THE DOUBLE THREAT GUIDE TO BEING SUCCESSFUL</p> <p>When Tim spoke to Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, Scott told him:</p> <p>"I always advise young people to become good public speakers".</p> <p>Anyone can do that, he says, with practice.</p> <p>"Suddenly you're in charge or maybe you are starting your own company. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable." If you are good at public speaking and one other skill, you make yourself more rare and valuable.</p> <p>Before Warren Buffett made one dime of money, he took a Dale Carnegie course on public speaking.</p> <p>After that, he made a dime of money. Or two.</p> <p>- DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO</p> <p>Dan Carlin, host of the super-podcast "Hardcore History" told Tim this.</p> <p>Dan was not a historian, didn't have a PhD, but was fascinated by history.</p> <p>His mother(!) told him, "why don't you do a podcast about the stories you tell here at the dinner table."</p> <p>He told his mother, but I don't have a doctorate."</p> <p>His mother said, "I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories".</p> <p>And now he has the most popular history-based podcast on the planet.</p> <p><a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/kamal" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=871600400" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1">Kamal Ravikant</a>, a past and future guest on my own podcast, told Tim, "If I only did things I was qualified for I'd be pushing a broom somewhere."</p> <p>Schools, corporations, government, parents, friends, want to put you in their own boxes. They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today.</p> <p>But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good.</p> <p>- THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED</p> <p>Kevin Kelly tells tim, "Success need not be complicated.

This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe.</p> <p>Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message.</p> <p>The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in.</p> <p>Start small.</p> <p>Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing.

Brian Koppelman, writer of Rounders, Ocean's 13, Billions, etc swears by this technique for increasing his creativity.</p> <p>Many of Tim's guests say the same thing.</p> <p>What are morning pages?</p> <p>Sit down in the morning, write in longhand three pages of garbage without stopping.</p> <p>This uncages the anxious "monkey mind" and puts it on the page. It unleashes any writer's block because you have permission to write total nonsense.</p> <p>It frees the mind for the creativity it needs to do that day.</p> <p>- THE DOUBLE THREAT GUIDE TO BEING SUCCESSFUL</p> <p>When Tim spoke to Scott Adams, creator of Dilbert, Scott told him:</p> <p>"I always advise young people to become good public speakers".</p> <p>Anyone can do that, he says, with practice.</p> <p>"Suddenly you're in charge or maybe you are starting your own company. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable." If you are good at public speaking and one other skill, you make yourself more rare and valuable.</p> <p>Before Warren Buffett made one dime of money, he took a Dale Carnegie course on public speaking.</p> <p>After that, he made a dime of money. Or two.</p> <p>- DON'T BE AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO</p> <p>Dan Carlin, host of the super-podcast "Hardcore History" told Tim this.</p> <p>Dan was not a historian, didn't have a PhD, but was fascinated by history.</p> <p>His mother(!) told him, "why don't you do a podcast about the stories you tell here at the dinner table."</p> <p>He told his mother, but I don't have a doctorate."</p> <p>His mother said, "I didn't realize you had to have a doctorate to tell stories".</p> <p>And now he has the most popular history-based podcast on the planet.</p> <p><a class="profileLink" href="https://www.facebook.com/kamal" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=871600400" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1">Kamal Ravikant</a>, a past and future guest on my own podcast, told Tim, "If I only did things I was qualified for I'd be pushing a broom somewhere."</p> <p>Schools, corporations, government, parents, friends, want to put you in their own boxes. They have a menu for you, with only very limited choices today.</p> <p>But if you don't choose your own themes in life, then someone else will do the choosing for you and the results won't be as good.</p> <p>- THE THOUSAND TRUE FAN THEORY....EXPANDED</p> <p>Kevin Kelly tells tim, "Success need not be complicated. Just start with making 1000 people extremely extremely happy,"</p> <p>Three ideas from this:</p> <p>Kevin's idea is that if they are true super fans, you will be able to build a product, charge for it, and they will pay, making you a living. Build a product that makes their lives better.</p> <p>Second idea: Have direct contact with your fans. This gets rid of all the middlemen and turns your relationships into a tribe.</p> <p>Third idea: Not every fan is a super fan. But the super fans will help you communicate with the other people who would be receptive to your message.</p> <p>The key here being: have an important and unique message. One that helps people. One that is a vision that people can believe in.</p> <p>Start small.</p> <p>Focus on the people who really care about what you are doing. As Seth Godin even says, "Find Ten" if you have to.</p> <p>Because if t's a good idea then ten will tell ten who will tell ten.</p> <p>Book recommendation from this chapter: "Small Giants" by Bo Burlingham, about companies that choose to be the best rather than the biggest.</p> <p>- ASK DUMB QUESTIONS</p> <p>This is a common theme throughout the book. Tony Robbins tells Tim, "We are the quality of the questions we ask."</p> <p>And both Alex Blumberg (super podcaster) and Malcolm Gladwell talk about the importance of asking dumb questions.</p> <p>People sometimes criticize me for interrupting guests on my podcasts. I get it.</p> <p>But the reality is: if I don't understand something during the podcast, then when else will I get the chance to understand.</p> <p>Alex Blumberg gives some good ways to start dumb questions:</p> <p>"Tell me about a time when..." "Tell me about the day when..." "What were the exact steps that got you to...." "Describe the conversation when..."</p> <p>And then with a follow up to any answer like, "How did that make you feel?"</p> <p>-- NO COMPLAINING</p> <p>Tracey DiNunzio told Tim a great line which I underlined twice in the book:</p> <p>"When you complain, NOBODY wants to help you":</p> <p>If you only focus what is wrong, then you will bring the people around you down.</p> <p>Be a source of growth for the people around you, so that they can become a source of growth for you.</p> <p>It's the "Honda" theory. If you just bought a Honda, you will suddenly see Hondas all over the road.</p> <p>If all you do is complain, you will only see the scarcity everywhere. And the abundance will leave you in the dust.</p> <p>- DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL THE SELF-HELP BOOKS</p> <p>This is not quite what was said, but this is my personal takeaway.</p> <p>BJ Novak, a writer from "The Office" for it's entire run and a successful comedian told Tim, "I read the book Daily Rituals and I am demoralized by how many great people start their day early."</p> <p>Instead, BJ spends several hours getting in a good mood. Walking, playing, fooling around, reading newspapers, etc. Getting in a good mood was the surest way to get creative ideas.</p> <p>He takes his own path.</p> <p>BJ's podcast recommendation: "Intelligence Squared".</p> <p>Oh! VERY important lesson from Novak. I'm always stressed that I need to publish every day.</p> <p>I even asked Ice T once: if you stopped doing things, how long would it take for people to forget about you?</p> <p>And he scared me when he answered almost immediately, "Six months".</p> <p>But Novak's advice to Tim was the opposite: "Take as long as you want if you're talented. You'll get their attention again if you have reason to."</p> <p>BOOM!</p> <p>- SAYING NO</p> <p>This came up as a theme in many of Tim's podcasts (including one with me about my book, "The Power of No").</p> <p>When you are young and getting started, say "Yes" to anything. Tim was talking to super-investor Chris Sacca who said, "I'd even show up at meetings where I wasn't invited."</p> <p>But ultimately, so many "inbound" requests come in for your time you have to say "no" to almost all of it.</p> <p>Tim says: "3 to 4 mornings per week I am in "maker" mode until at least 1pm" - creativity without allowing for ANY interruptions.</p> <p>- "WISDOM IS ABOUT FOLLOWING YOUR OWN ADVICE"</p> <p>Sam Harris (a prior guest on my podcast as well) told Tim this.</p> <p>I strongly believe this. For a few years I was writing about my "daily practice" that I had used many times when things were at their worst for me.</p> <p>Then in 2015, two really difficult things happened to me. One financial and one in my relationships.</p> <p>Right away I said to myself, "Ok, let's see if this still works".</p> <p>And every night I would check the boxes: Did I improve 1% today physically,, emotionally, mentally, spiritually.</p> <p>Without this, I think I would have died or spun into massive depression both times. I followed my own advice.</p> <p>If you can't do this, then no advice will work. Advice is autobiography.</p> <p>----</p> <p>After the podcast was over, Tim and I spoke for awhile. He gave me advice about my podcast. He gave me advice about my next book. He told me some of the things that didn't make it into the book.</p> <p>Tim strives to increase his creativity. To experiment with new ideas, new formats, new ways to apply his creativity.</p> <p>"Try things as an experiment. Always give yourself an out. Then when something works, double down."</p> <p>I left his place and it was dark. I had spent the past week doing nothing but reading his book and preparing.</p> <p>The last thing Tim suggested, "Think about what advice your future self would give you right now."</p> <p>I thought about it. I went home. Had dinner. Thought more.</p> <p>This is what my 60 year old self should say if he could advise me right now:</p> <p>Care deeply about the work you do today. The future will take care of itself.</p> <p>Oh and, "Don't be late."</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What does it sound like when you change your mind?</p> <p>That's the name of Seth Godin's next book. He only printed 5,500 copies. And he's not printing anymore.</p> <p>He doesn't just view a book as pages surrounded by two covers. He makes a 3-dimensional object that's beautiful to look at and read.</p> <p>"It's not new,” he said on my podcast. “It's the best of the last four years of my work. And it's illustrated with hundreds of photos by Thomas Hawk, who's the most prolific and talented internet photographer."</p> <p>The book weighs 18 pounds. And it's 800 pages long.</p> <p>I asked him about art and marketing... and he told me about life.</p> <p>A) START FROM THE BEGINNING</p> <p>"No business, no project, no novel ever started big," Seth said.</p> <p>It started with fear, uncertainty, excitement, possibility. Tons of “what if’s” that lead to real action. And real action halts the what if’s. The what if’s turn to what is.</p> <p>Seth said, “Instead of saying, 'I need to leap to the middle,' say, 'I'm going to start with people who want to engage with me.'"</p> <p>All successes start with one person. That's it. One person, then two, then three.</p> <p>Success is a curve. We all know it. Don't try to cheat the curve.</p> <p>B) KNOW YOUR WORLD</p> <p>I asked Seth, "How do you know what the world wants to hear?"</p> <p>"Well, first of all,” he said, “never the whole world. You pick your world."</p> <p>Where do you hurt? Where you do you feel a knot? Can you loosen it up and ease the pressure?</p> <p>Can you create something for the people who want to love what you want to love?</p> <p>C) WHAT DO YOU CARE ENOUGH TO SAY?</p> <p>We talked about Facebook. And the Lays Potato Chip guy who re-designed the bag. His job was to make it sound crunchier.</p> <p>Kids had slamming competitions. Who could slam a soda the fastest? So Coke-A-Cola created a bottle with a mouthpiece meant to maximize chugging efficiency.</p> <p>They sold product. But it's the message that matters.</p> <p>I always say: message over money.</p> <p>Invention happens at the edges. Between heart and lungs, breath and vocal chords is the message. It's the thing you want to say. The thing you’re afraid to say.</p> <p>"What really matters isn't what time you posted on Facebook," Seth said. "What matters is, what did you care enough to say?</p> <p>D) ANYONE CAN LEAD...</p> <p>"’Purple Cow' says, 'How do I sit in my office and make a thing that people talk about?'"</p> <p>"What 'Tribes' says is 'Now that anyone can stand up and lead (because anyone can have a media channel... because anyone can make connection) will you choose to lead? And if you're going to lead, who will you lead? How will you connect the people you're leading? That is marketing, but it's also life."</p> <p>E) CULTURE BEATS EVERYTHING</p> <p>"No one has a Suzuki tattoo," Seth said.</p> <p>"What's a Suzuki tattoo?" I asked.</p> <p>Then I got it. Harley Davidson makes half their revenue licensing their brand. T-shirts, jackets, etc.</p> <p>"If you're in the Harley tribe, you can't show up on a Suzuki," he said.</p> <p>"Tribes aren't about the alpha to the omega. Leaders always go away. The alpha person dies or moves on. But the tribe doesn't. The tribe persists. Because culture beats everything. Scenes have a culture. Tribes have a culture. It's culture that determines how an organization make its choices, how a nation will evolve."</p> <p>I've said this before. It doesn't matter who the president is. What matters is who you surround yourself with. Who's in your tribe? Who's in your heart?</p> <p>And if they're toxic to your creativity or well-being, detox now.</p> <p>"The Beatles didn't invent teenagers. I'm not saying we invent our tribe. We just show up to lead them."</p> <p>I didn't invent the choose yourself community. The cubicle job did.</p> <p>I'll never say what other people should do. I just say what I like to do. I say what gets me past just getting by.</p> <p>F) SHOW UP</p> <p>“Half my blog posts are below average,” Seth said.</p> <p>I asked if he feels bad.</p> <p>Intellectually, I understand failure. But it still hurts. It can turn your life upside down. I lost everything more than once. And maybe you’re reading this because you have to… or you're afraid of losing everything.</p> <p>“I’m talking about [creating] generous work with good intent... that didn’t work.” That’s the failure we need to show up for.</p> <p>“I show up,” Seth said.</p> <p>G) DON'T WRESTLE WITH INFINITY I didn't know what that meant.</p> <p>"I am almost done wrestling with infinity," he said.</p> <p>We had half an hour left in the interview. I didn't interrupt.</p> <p>I couldn't.</p> <p>I was captivated. My mind expands when I’m seconds away from hearing someone’s genius. My vision slows and the inside of my ears soften. It’s like my body is creating room.</p> <p>"I made the book I wanted."</p> <p>"I only printed 5,500 copies of the book. And there's not going to be a second printing. That's all there is.”</p> <p>He doesn't have to chase. He already broke even and the best part is he chose himself.</p> <p>"Now there's not an infinity of upside."</p> <p>He didn't need approval from publishers, his boss, a network… He didn’t write for a bestseller list. He was compelled. And he created.</p> <p>He made what he wanted to make.  </p> <p>"Here's my definition of art,” he said. “Art is when a human being does something that might not work..."</p> <p>And my whole body nodded.</p> <p>He went on… changing my mind.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Brian Koppelman and his wife Amy Koppelman saved my life. Many years after he ruined my life.</p> <div>First off: when he wrote the movie “Rounders” I became obsessed with poker. I went to the same club he played at and played for 365 nights, including the night my first daughter was born (I was there for the birth though!) .</div> <div> </div> <div>I was an addict. But eventually I stopped in order to start another company. I wish I had never stopped because that other company cost me all of my money at the time.</div> <div> </div> <div>Then he wrote several of my favorite movies after that. I didn’t even know it was the same director until the first time I interviewed him here.</div> <div> </div> <div>Now he is writing and producing my favorite TV show, “Billions” on Showtime. About an aggressive hedge fund billionaire going after an equally aggressive US Attorney played by Paul Giamatti.</div> <div> </div> <div>Brian has been on the podcast several times but there’s always so much more to talk about in terms of creativity and inspiration and how to succeed as an artist / entrepreneur.</div> <div> </div> <div>Ditto for his wife Amy who has also been on this podcast and written three of my favorite novels.

Many years after he ruined my life.</p> First off: when he wrote the movie “Rounders” I became obsessed with poker. I went to the same club he played at and played for 365 nights, including the night my first daughter was born (I was there for the birth though!) .   I was an addict. But eventually I stopped in order to start another company. I wish I had never stopped because that other company cost me all of my money at the time.   Then he wrote several of my favorite movies after that. I didn’t even know it was the same director until the first time I interviewed him here.   Now he is writing and producing my favorite TV show, “Billions” on Showtime. About an aggressive hedge fund billionaire going after an equally aggressive US Attorney played by Paul Giamatti.   Brian has been on the podcast several times but there’s always so much more to talk about in terms of creativity and inspiration and how to succeed as an artist / entrepreneur.   Ditto for his wife Amy who has also been on this podcast and written three of my favorite novels. One of which was turned into a movie (“I Smile Back”) starring Sarah Silverman.   But here is how they saved my life.   Awhile back I had a personal emergency. Things were going haywire.   Amy called me and said, “What’s going on?” I told her.   She had me take a photo of every meal I was eating (“I want to make sure you are eating”) and a photo of everyone I was eating with (“I want to make sure you are around people”) and had me write to her every day what was going on in my head (“write!”)   That was one time.   Another time: I lost millions of dollars in a half hour while I was on the set of “Billions” watching it be filmed.   I was called into an emergency board meeting by phone and found out the company was going to be shut down. It was a disaster.   But 90% of how we feel about a situation is determined by our choice of how we will react. Only 10% is based on the situation itself.   And since I was on the set of my favorite TV show being filmed, I decided to enjoy myself. Brian later said to me, “You lost what!? We couldn’t tell at all. You were making jokes, asking questions, and you were the last one to leave.”   I used being on the set of “Billions” to change my reaction to an otherwise horrible event. This allowed me to easily change my 90% reaction into a positive one.   So not only is Brian a creative genius, but he’s a good friend.   I went up to his offices where they are writing season 2 of “Billions” and I had maybe 1,000 more questions about creativity, writing, the arc of his career, and of course, billions of dollars.   But one thing stands out for me.   Everyone always says, as if it were advice that has come down from heaven to all writers: “Write what you know”.   Brian doesn’t agree with this. And this is the secret to his success. And the secret to all the great writers in history.   Stephen King didn’t know what it was like to be a bullied teenage girl with psychic powers when he wrote “Carrie”.   Ernest Hemingway didn’t know what it was like to be an old Cuban man who spent his life fishing.   JK Rowling didn’t know what it would be like to be a boy attending Hogwarts Wizardry School.   Brian Koppelman told me:   “Don’t write what you know, write what fascinates you.”    This is the key to all good art.   In this podcast, we also talk about what it feels like to hit a dead-end. To be unsure how to move forward. To be scared that maybe the best was behind us.   How do you move past that. Recreate yourself. Start the work again. Flourish.   I ask. Brian delivers.]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>He died. He was giving a speech, sat down, and the next thing… <strong>he was dead.</strong></p> <p>They called an ambulance. They got paramedics. They did that thing. They brought him back to life. But his body didn’t like living.</p> <p>He died again. Eight more times they used machines to convince the machine in his body that we call a heart, to come back to life.</p> <p>Please come back to life, the machines said to his heart. <strong>And finally his heart decided to stay.</strong></p> <p>After that, things changed. Like they often do when we die at the age of 47.</p> <p>“There are three things,” Chip Conley, now the head of hospitality for AirBnB, told me, “a job, a career, and a calling.”</p> <p>“I had been building and running hotels for 20 years. It was my calling to be in the hospitality business. I built over 50 hotels. But it was starting to feel like a job.”</p> <p>“When I died, I realized I couldn’t do it anymore. I had to go back to my calling.”</p> <p>Within a few years he had sold his business. He had nothing left to do.</p> <p>“I had faith in my calling, though,” Chip said. “Something would happen.”</p> <p>And it did. It did.</p> <hr /> <p>Adam wrote me. He was my Airbnb host. I’ve been in 4 different Airbnbs that Adam owns over the past three years.</p> <p>So we knew each other. <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2016/04/minimalism-brought-freedom-joy/" target="_blank">I only live in Airbnbs</a> and I know many of the regular hosts in New York City.</p> <p>“I’m having a special guest in the apartment right downstairs from you,” Adam wrote me. “He’s the head of all hospitality for Airbnb. Would you like to meet?’</p> <p>Yes, very much so. I had spent 90% of my life in Airbnbs over the prior three years and just about 100% in the prior year. In 2014 I even wrote an article, “10 Ways to Improve Airbnb.”</p> <p>Adam made the introduction. Chip Conley, the man who had died a few years earlier and sold his hotel business, responded.</p> <p>“Should I bring a bottle of wine?” he said. He came upstairs and we started to talk.</p> <p>“Brian Chesky, the founder of Airbnb, called me and asked me if I wanted to be the head of hospitality. Airbnb was a tech company, it wasn’t used to being a hospitality company.”</p> <p>“When I ran 50 hotels, hospitality was my main focus.”</p> <p>“For each hotel, I had the hotel managers come up with five adjectives for what that hotel would be.”</p> <p>“Maybe the adjectives might be: funky, hip, modern, clean, rock & roll.”</p> <p>“Every employee, even the housekeepers, would keep those adjectives in mind in whatever they did. And, if possible, we even made sure the five senses the customers would experience in the hotels would match the five adjectives.”</p> <p>“This is a great idea,” I said, “You can even apply ideas like this to writing a book. Or even building a career for yourself. What five adjectives do you want your life, or the objects you create, or your relationships, be used to describe it.”</p> <p>“Absolutely,” Chip said.</p> <p>So he went to Airbnb to start creating an atmosphere of hospitality among the hosts. <strong>He had found his way back to his life’s calling.</strong></p> <p>I had felt it. Since 2013, Now I live in them. Now they are home.</p> <p>All because Chip died.</p> <hr /> <p>“How do you find your life’s calling?” I asked him.</p> <p>“What did you love doing when you were 6, 8, 10 years old,” he said.</p> <p>“Like I had one friend who even at 6 was making mudpies as if they were real pies. Then she became a lawyer but was always unhappy.”</p> <p>“So she quit being a lawyer and is now one of the biggest pastry chefs in the world.”</p> <p>“For me, I was always pretending to run a restaurant in my house. I always wanted to be in the hospitality business.”</p> <p>I thought back to when I was ten years old. I was writing short stories. <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/01/how-i-became-a-writer-or-my-visit-with-the-president-of-the-united-states/" target="_blank">And when I was 12 I even wrote an article in the newspaper interviewing politicians</a>.</p> <p>You find your interests from back then and see how they age into the current day.</p> <p>“Find the thing you did where you lost all sense of time while you are doing it,” Chip told me.</p> <p>“Remember the equation from Victor Frankl’s ‘<a href= "http://amzn.to/2dCzCZE" target="_blank">Man’s Search for Meaning</a>‘,” he said.</p> <p>“<strong>Despair = Suffering – Meaning</strong>.”</p> <p>“Find the things that bring you meaning. Suffering is always there in this world. But if you have meaning, you will have less despair.</p> <p>“You will find your calling.”</p> <p>Sometimes even now I find myself doing things where I feel more ‘job’ than ‘calling’. I try to adjust where I can but it can be difficult. I guess a little bit at a time and eventually you can move your life into that calling.</p> <p>I said to him. “This is too good. Do you mind if I record the conversation?”</p> <p>He said, “Sure.” So I did. I’ve been recording conversations with people ever since I was ten years old.</p> <hr /> <p>When I was 26, he said, <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/04/the-100-rules-for-being-an-entrepreneur/" target="_blank">I wanted to be an entrepreneur</a>. I found my first little motel and called it The Phoenix.</p> <p>“I knew that whatever I did, I wanted to be creative and to have freedom. I tell everyone to write down the two most important qualities about their calling and check back with it over the years.</p> <p>“Eventually I felt like what I was doing was the opposite of creativity and freedom.”</p> <p>“And that’s when I had that experience of flatlining. That was my body’s way of telling me I had to change. So I got rid of my hotels.”</p> <p>“What if you are sitting in a cubicle and listening to this and wondering how you can find that creativity and freedom for yourself – it all sounds good BUT – kids, responsibilities, age, etc. you feel are blocking you?”</p> <p>“Then get back to what you loved when you were younger. Start to brainstorm how you can bring that even a little bit into your life now. And a little bit more the next day. And so on.”</p> <p>“Try many things,” he said, “One thing I realized is that quantity = quality. People think it’s one or the other but it’s not. When you have a lot of quantity of ideas and things you are trying, you will find quality.”</p> <p>This reminded me of <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/" target="_blank">my approach to exercising my idea muscle</a>. If you write down ten ideas a day, you have 3,650 ideas in a year. And maybe one or two will be good.</p> <p>I got excited about my ideas to improve Airbnb. I said, “Can I show you the ideas?” I had written the list in 2014 but maybe they would still apply.</p> <p>“Of course!” he said.</p> <p>We went through each one. For some of them he said, “Hold on! Wait for the announcement coming soon.”</p> <p>We lost track of time while doing the interview and eventually he had to go.</p> <p>“You know,” he said, “I saw something about you a few weeks ago and thought you would be a great speaker for our event in November – the Airbnb Open.”</p> <p>“And then Adam told me yesterday, by coincidence, you were staying in the apartment right above me.”</p> <p>“That’s funny,” I said.</p> <p>“I love it when serendipity happens,” he said, as he was getting ready to go. “You have to speak at the conference.”</p> <p>“I will!”</p> <p>After he left I thought about what I most wanted to do when I was a kid.</p> <p>I wanted to be a spy.</p> <p>On what? I don’t know. I just wanted to look at other people and follow them without them knowing. To observe and learn all of their secrets and then report back to “HQ”.</p> <p>It would be a little dangerous, I always thought. But I would survive. And save the world.</p> <p>Bit by bit I’m doing it. My calling.</p>]]></description>

I try to adjust where I can but it can be difficult. I guess a little bit at a time and eventually you can move your life into that calling.</p> <p>I said to him. “This is too good. Do you mind if I record the conversation?”</p> <p>He said, “Sure.” So I did. I’ve been recording conversations with people ever since I was ten years old.</p>  <p>When I was 26, he said, <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/04/the-100-rules-for-being-an-entrepreneur/" target="_blank">I wanted to be an entrepreneur</a>. I found my first little motel and called it The Phoenix.</p> <p>“I knew that whatever I did, I wanted to be creative and to have freedom. I tell everyone to write down the two most important qualities about their calling and check back with it over the years.</p> <p>“Eventually I felt like what I was doing was the opposite of creativity and freedom.”</p> <p>“And that’s when I had that experience of flatlining. That was my body’s way of telling me I had to change. So I got rid of my hotels.”</p> <p>“What if you are sitting in a cubicle and listening to this and wondering how you can find that creativity and freedom for yourself – it all sounds good BUT – kids, responsibilities, age, etc. you feel are blocking you?”</p> <p>“Then get back to what you loved when you were younger. Start to brainstorm how you can bring that even a little bit into your life now. And a little bit more the next day. And so on.”</p> <p>“Try many things,” he said, “One thing I realized is that quantity = quality. People think it’s one or the other but it’s not. When you have a lot of quantity of ideas and things you are trying, you will find quality.”</p> <p>This reminded me of <a href= "http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/" target="_blank">my approach to exercising my idea muscle</a>. If you write down ten ideas a day, you have 3,650 ideas in a year. And maybe one or two will be good.</p> <p>I got excited about my ideas to improve Airbnb. I said, “Can I show you the ideas?” I had written the list in 2014 but maybe they would still apply.</p> <p>“Of course!” he said.</p> <p>We went through each one. For some of them he said, “Hold on! Wait for the announcement coming soon.”</p> <p>We lost track of time while doing the interview and eventually he had to go.</p> <p>“You know,” he said, “I saw something about you a few weeks ago and thought you would be a great speaker for our event in November – the Airbnb Open.”</p> <p>“And then Adam told me yesterday, by coincidence, you were staying in the apartment right above me.”</p> <p>“That’s funny,” I said.</p> <p>“I love it when serendipity happens,” he said, as he was getting ready to go. “You have to speak at the conference.”</p> <p>“I will!”</p> <p>After he left I thought about what I most wanted to do when I was a kid.</p> <p>I wanted to be a spy.</p> <p>On what? I don’t know. I just wanted to look at other people and follow them without them knowing. To observe and learn all of their secrets and then report back to “HQ”.</p> <p>It would be a little dangerous, I always thought. But I would survive. And save the world.</p> <p>Bit by bit I’m doing it. My calling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JOKE</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last night I wrote down six things I wanted to do today. I kept number six blank.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“JOKE” was just a reminder to start this post with a joke from Jon Macks…</span></p> <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you live in Florida, ya know, God’s waiting room…”</span></em></p> <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re Jewish, like me…”</span></em></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just a few lines from my interview with Jon Macks. He was the top writer for “The Tonight Show” with Jay Leno.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wrote 100 jokes a day. That’s half a million in 20 years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s written jokes for President Obama, Bill Clinton, John Kerry and monologues for Steve Martin, Billy Crystal, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock… and wrote the book “Monogluge: What Makes America Laugh Before Bed.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before comedy, Jon did political consulting.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I realized I could do one thing 300 nights a year: politics or perform. And I chose politics.” He somehow transitioned and reached the heights of a dream career in comedy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know his secret.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also wanted to know how to be funny...</span></p> <p>1. Association Joke:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Jon how to run for Congress. “Anti-Washington, anti-establishment is what’s working right now,” he said.</span></p> <div>I’m not running for Congress.</div> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, the night of this interview, I went to an open mic. So I ran some headlines by Jon. And he wrote jokes on the spot.</span></p> <p>Headline: “Trump Refuses To Say He’ll Accept Election Results”</p> <p>Jon<span style="font-weight: 400;">: “The Toronto Blue Jays lost yesterday. They’re refusing to accept the fact that the Cleveland Indians are going to the world series.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an association joke. You look at what else is happening. Then marry the two.</span></p> <p>2. Rule of 3’s:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Billy Crystals joke: “Donald Trump reminds me a lot of hurricane season. He starts out with a lot of hot air, spins out of control, by the first week of November he’s completely gone.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule of 3’s is this: Set up your joke. Start with a fact or an idea. Then expand on the idea by listing three qualities. The third is usually unexpected. That’s your punchline.</span></p> <p>3. Look for the oddity</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon said, “Most normal people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">and I put comics as ‘not normal’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">most normal people walk into a room and go, ‘This looks like a great party.’” But a comic asks questions.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who shouldn’t be here?” “Why are they serving bacon cheeseburgers at a Jewish event?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go beyond business as usual. Look for the oddity… in contracts, your conversations, your habits.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to find the light in life’s eccentricities. Or the bull... in shit.</span></p> <p>4. Find “your kind of people” and bring them together</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, I practice what I call “emotional health.” I spend time with people who lift me up. And I try to lift them up, too. Not with words. But with interests. We hold space for each other. And leave room for the juice in our brain to squeeze out. It’s a different kind of lemonade, but it’s ours. And we like it. That’s all that matters.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seinfeld calls comedians “his type of people.” As if they have different brains than everyone else. So I asked Jon, “What is it? What is</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">the</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">comedian?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said, “A comic will go on stage and either say something we haven’t thought of, or something we all thought of in a way that is really unique, funny and brings us all together.”</span></p> <p>5. Move forward</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon was traveling about 250 nights a year doing campaigns. His third kid was just born. And he had a choice: be a dad or “be someone calling in once a week.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lots of people make this choice. Money is involved. Fulfillment is a factor. The stress of making the “right” versus the “wrong” decision.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jon went with his gut.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I figured I’d take a break from political consulting, and I never went back.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He had a 13-week contract with Jay Leno. That turned into a lifetime…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before podcasting and writing, I worked on Wall Street. When everything crashed, I fed people chocolate.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to bring people together.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe that’s number six.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t tell you the secret to selling half a million books. Or half a million anything…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every day, business changes, the world shifts on its axis and your skin peels off a little bit. New cells are generated and with each blink, your eyes are rehydrated.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll admit, if there was some formula, I’d do it again,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without new experiences, your soul rots. And your book or product or whatever you’re trying to get rich quick off of smells like garbage.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But people will buy garbage. Because we want new experiences. Ask any child. They’ll give you an honest answer of why they like coloring or skipping rope.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know... It’s fun?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People wonder what they love. Instead of loving to wonder.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Klosterman grew up in a town of 500 people. He became the number one literary critique of pop culture… before the Internet. Now anyone can research anything. And you don’t have to own the Encyclopedia Britannica. Or wait for the library to be open.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people I’ve interviewed say there’s a big luck factor to success... “But I don’t think that’s as true with you,” I told Chuck.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He doesn’t believe in luck.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest factor is chance,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s the difference between chance and luck?”</span></p> <p>Luck:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luck almost implies like a leprechaun is, sort of somebody is making this happen.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In many ways, it seems like certain people are luckier than others,” he said. “I think what that really means is that when they were given chances, they elected to pursue them, as opposed to step away from them. And that kind of creates the illusion of luck.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I feel stuck, I don’t create a new business overnight. I begin with a pen and a waiter’s pad. I carve out a new perspective. I write 10 ideas.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the ideas are good doesn’t matter.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reinvention, freedom and success are the results of movements.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not the “right movements.” Just movements. Unattached, meaningless movements that hopefully fill your day and fuel your heart.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everything I’ve liked, I liked in totality,” Chuck said. “I wanted to almost be inside of it.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on nothing. Or everything. Let life reveal itself to you. Then you won’t need luck. Because you’ll have something much more valuable: perspective.</span></p> <p>Skill:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he started, Chuck needed motivation to write. Now he’s a dad. And he writes every day. “I make myself do it,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first job was with the local newspaper in Fargo. He wrote a 16-page insert called “Rage,” meant to address Generation X.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the time, my hope was that, maybe, if I do a good job as a reporter and I put in the time, I’d be able to publish a book, or maybe two books in my 50s or something.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought he’d work as a reporter who might have the ability or the luck or the chance...</span></p> <p><strong>Chance:</strong></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were 23 kids in my graduating class. I remember the teacher would ask questions. And nobody would say anything,” Chuck said.</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style= "font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">But he knew the answers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thought everyone knew. “I just assumed everyone growing up felt this way—everybody felt very singular and alone. You had this world inside your mind. And there was the world outside of yourself where you just kind of goofed around, talked to people, and made small talk, but in your mind you had your own kind of world.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Chuck went to college. “I was amazed to find a handful of people who were just like me, who listened to Mötley Crüe but also wanted to talk about it, and didn’t just want to say, ‘It rocked.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connection changes your mental identity from alone to alive.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck’s second book,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs” sold half a million copies—more than his other eight books combined.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only perspective I have is my own,” Chuck said. “There is the conscious experience, then there is the unconscious experience. Some of those merge when I’m writing.”</span></p> <p>Mystery...</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck’s latest book asks a hypothetical question that no one will know the answer to for hundreds or thousands of years: “But What If We’re Wrong?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He explores art, music, science, physics, the nature of reality, and who will matter in the future.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Aristotle was one of the first people to have an idea about what gravity was. His idea was that rocks don’t float because rocks</span> <em><span style= "font-weight: 400;">want</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">to be on the ground, that they have agency. They long to be on the ground because they want to be at the center of the universe, and, at the time, it was believed that Earth was the center of the universe.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was believed for roughly 2,000 years. Today’s idea of gravity is from Isaac Newton. Nearly 1,600 years ago.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if we’re wrong?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About everything. Food, medicine, music, legacy…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My idea of a life well lived could (and probably will) be untrue in 100 years or 10 years. That’s scary.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or not.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The illusion is up to you.</span></p>]]></description>

He wrote a 16-page insert called “Rage,” meant to address Generation X.</p> <p>“At the time, my hope was that, maybe, if I do a good job as a reporter and I put in the time, I’d be able to publish a book, or maybe two books in my 50s or something.”</p> <p>He thought he’d work as a reporter who might have the ability or the luck or the chance...</p> <p>Chance:</p> <p>“There were 23 kids in my graduating class. I remember the teacher would ask questions. And nobody would say anything,” Chuck said.But he knew the answers.</p> <p>He thought everyone knew. “I just assumed everyone growing up felt this way—everybody felt very singular and alone. You had this world inside your mind. And there was the world outside of yourself where you just kind of goofed around, talked to people, and made small talk, but in your mind you had your own kind of world.”</p> <p>Then Chuck went to college. “I was amazed to find a handful of people who were just like me, who listened to Mötley Crüe but also wanted to talk about it, and didn’t just want to say, ‘It rocked.’”</p> <p>Connection changes your mental identity from alone to alive.</p> <p>Chuck’s second book, “Sex, Drugs and Cocoa Puffs” sold half a million copies—more than his other eight books combined.</p> <p>“The only perspective I have is my own,” Chuck said. “There is the conscious experience, then there is the unconscious experience. Some of those merge when I’m writing.”</p> <p>Mystery...</p> <p>Chuck’s latest book asks a hypothetical question that no one will know the answer to for hundreds or thousands of years: “But What If We’re Wrong?”</p> <p>He explores art, music, science, physics, the nature of reality, and who will matter in the future.</p> <p>“Aristotle was one of the first people to have an idea about what gravity was. His idea was that rocks don’t float because rocks <em>want</em> to be on the ground, that they have agency. They long to be on the ground because they want to be at the center of the universe, and, at the time, it was believed that Earth was the center of the universe.”</p> <p>This was believed for roughly 2,000 years. Today’s idea of gravity is from Isaac Newton. Nearly 1,600 years ago.</p> <p>So…</p> <p>What if we’re wrong?</p> <p>About everything. Food, medicine, music, legacy…</p> <p>My idea of a life well lived could (and probably will) be untrue in 100 years or 10 years. That’s scary.</p> <p>Or not.</p> <p>The illusion is up to you.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Terrorists have moms,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Schilling was kidnapped in the Philippines and held hostage for 7 and a half months. The terrorists said they were torturing him.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Chris Voss didn’t fall for it.</span></p> <p>Chris is a former FBI hostage negotiator and the author of, “Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It.”</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Find a way to mention his mother’s concern for him,” Chris’ boss said.</span></p> <p>“I remember thinking, ‘That’s the dumbest idea I ever heard. A terrorist is going to care about this guys mother?’”</p> <p>“But my boss had great insight. And I didn’t see any downside to it. So in the middle of the negotiation I said, ‘Ya know Jeff’s mom is really worried about him.’”</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What happened next?” I asked.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This murderous, sociopathic terrorist said, ‘His mother knows about this? You tell his mother he’s OK.’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Months later, Jeffrey came home.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hostage negotiation tactics won’t work in business or with your wife.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these 5 tactics will…</span></p> <p>1. Use the “hand-cuff method”:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use this line when someone yells at you: “I can’t hear you when you’re yelling at me.”</span></p> <p>The logic simple. People yell when they want you to listen.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you eliminate their reward (being heard), then they have to comply. And you’ll never get yelled at again.</span></p> <p> 2. Push past threats:</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who make threats always leave themselves an out,” Chris said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the truth is they need you. If you’re not talking, there’s no deal. They could lose out on a sale, a new employee, or millions of dollars.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The point of a negotiation is to find out how much money is on the table,” Chris said. “You have to push the other side as far as they’ll go… without insulting them.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p> 3. Gain the upper hand 100% of the time:</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can gain the upper hand by giving respect first,” Chris said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which a lot of people are afraid to do...</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that’s exactly</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></em> <span style= "font-weight: 400;">you gain the upper hand,” Chris said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p> 4. Become less busy:</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest is the new hustle.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anytime you slow down to do things more deliberately, you save time.” Chris calls this, “The delay that saves time.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p> 5. Show fearlessness</p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear can be useful. But not in a negotiation. “Showing fearlessness is a great way to inspire confidence in you from the other side,” Chris said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget what you have to lose. And focus on the reward.</span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t afford to lose all my money again.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Jewel was broke and homeless, but she still turned down a million dollar check when she was 19 years old.</p> <p>Jewel was broke and m<span class="text_exposed_show">illions in debt after selling 30,000,000 albums, and built back from scratch when she was 30.</span></p> <div class="text_exposed_show"> <p>Jewel has switched genres, written music from folk to pop to country to even children’s music. She wrote a children’s book.</p> <p>I love Jewel.</p> <p>Abused from the ages of 5 to 15. Moved out of the cold barn she was living in at 15 to live on her own. And three years later she was homeless.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to be a statistic,” she told me she was afraid when she was 15. “I looked around at other girls who were in my circumstances and things went from bad to worse”</p> <p>And yet… she ended up a statistic. She realized this when she was 18, living out of a car, and attempting to stuff a dress down her pants in a store so she could steal it.</p> <p>When I was 18 I feel I was privileged. I had no real worries. I was "suburban lucky". Luck ruined me and made me complacent. I never would have made the good decisions Jewel ended up making.</p> <p>That’s why I love her. That’s why I’m glad she came on my podcast. I’m sure she’s done 100s of interviews to promote her new book, “Never Broken”, an excellent book.</p> <p>But I wanted to break her down. I wanted her to laugh. She was so smart and serious. Trust me: I got her to laugh.</p> <p>A) HARD WOOD GROWS SLOWLY</p> <p>Why did a homeless girl who sang for pennies in a cafe turn down a million dollar offer?</p> <p>“Hard wood grows slowly,” she said. "I saw that as a kid. The soft trees would break. The hard trees would grow and live forever."</p> <p>She said: I knew I wanted to grow for a long time in this business. I also knew we were still in the grunge era and I was not grunge.</p> <p>If I took a million dollar deal, I read that I would have to pay it back. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to and I would be dropped by the label and that would be the end of my career.</p> <p>In fact, my album didn’t do well the first year. But then went on to sell over 10,000,000 copies.</p> <p>They didn’t drop me because I was just that girl they paid twelve dollars for. You have to think long-term instead of short-term always.</p> <p>—-</p> <p>She was 19.</p> <p>I do NOT think I would have made that decision. I think I would have made the wrong decisions.</p> <p>How does one take such a long term view at such a young age. I think it was the ten years she had spent developing her skills, singing in bars all over Alaska, preparing for this moment.</p> <p>Confidence is really difficult to develop. I don’t know if I have it even now. But I’m going to remember this lesson on the next business decision I have to make.</p> <p>B) REINVENTION IS NON-STOP</p> <p>Jewel has written children’s books, gone from folk music to pop to children’s to country. She’s been a rancher. She’s been homeless.</p> <p>I asked her, “You had the benefit of really cultivating your talent from ages 5 to 15. You sang with your dad at gigs every week.</p> <p>“Do you think someone starting from scratch at 50 can do this?”</p> <p>“Absolutely,” she said, “Reinvention never ends. It’s every day. Pursue what you enjoy and move towards it and there will be opportunities.”</p> <p>I look at my own life today. I’m about to finish a children’s book. I’m looking into TV. I’m working on a novel. I have other business things.</p> <p>I don’t know if any of them will work. But I know if I don’t keep trying I will slip back into whatever hole I constantly have to dig myself out of.</p> <p>There are two days to start something new. When you are five years old. And today.</p> <p>C) CREATE ART FOR YOURSELF</p> <p>I said these words: “So when you were talking to Neil Young…”</p> <p>What funny words to say to someone, I thought at the time and told her.</p> <p>Neil Young told her: don’t ever write for radio!</p> <p>Meaning: don’t write for the masses, write for yourself.</p> <p>I asked her, “isn’t there a tension there? Like what if you write for yourself and then nobody likes it? Don’t you want to write something that people like?”</p> <p>She said, “We all have common experiences. Ultimately when you write for yourself, you tap into that common cultural experience we all share.”</p> <p>That was eye-opening to me.</p> <p>If you put in the time to develop the skills, eventually you will burrow so deep inside yourself with your art that you will tap into that same vein of blood that runs through each of us.</p> <p>The key to good art is figuring out who you are.</p> <p>Writing for yourself, then, becomes the best way to write something that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p> <p>D) FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF.</p> <p>But, still, a relationship has to be earned back.</p> <p>Around the time she was 30, Jewel had sold tens of millions of albums, was doing 700 shows a year, and had no money. In fact she was two million in debt.</p> <p>How could that be? She had given all control to her mother and her mother had destroyed it all.</p> <p>Since 2003 she hasn’t spoken to her mother.</p> <p>She made back the money eventually, and has been incredibly successful since then.</p> <p>“Will you ever talk to your mother again?” I asked.</p> <p>I forgive her, she said. But forgiveness is the gift I had to give myself. Forgiveness is not for others.</p> <p>She said: Everyone still has to earn back the relationship. Forgiveness is not the same as condoning something.</p> <p>E) WE ALL SELF-MEDICATE</p> <p>“I saw this at 8 years old,” she said, “Singing in bars. Everyone would be unhappy, they’d drink, and they’d get more unhappy.</p> <p>“I swore to never drink or do drugs.</p> <p>“But we all need ways to cope - to ‘medicate’ our issues.</p> <p>“I started writing every day. Journaling, writing the lyrics to what became my songs.</p> <p>“I found that every time I wrote, it reduced my anxiety, even when I was living in my car.”</p> <p>Writing music became the way she self-medicated. It worked.</p> <p>F) WATCH THE HANDS</p> <p>Fears and anxieties sneak up on us. Suddenly, we don’t know from where, but we panic and feel that constriction in our stomach.</p> <p>It’s hard to observe our thoughts before it’s too late.</p> <p>“So I watch my hands,” she said, “I started keeping a journal of what my hands were doing.”</p> <p>What do you mean?</p> <p>“Was I opening doors for more people? I’d count up the times I’d open doors for people, I’d shake hands with people, I’d be open with people instead of having my arms crossed.”</p> <p>Watching the hands taught Jewel when she was kind and had compassion and was less anxious.</p> <p>There’s a quote in her book, “Emotions are the shadows of thoughts.”</p> <p>I think also, Actions are then the shadows of those emotions.</p> <p>“Starve your negative thoughts,” she said. By being aware of them in any way possible (watch the hands), you can stop them from being obsessive, then you starve them of the attention they need from your brain.</p> <p>They stop growing, they disappear.</p> <p>You can go from homeless, to finding a cafe to play your music, to putting flyers around town, to getting an audience, to attracting music executives, to getting a million dollar deal.</p> <p>While living in your car.</p> <p>G) ACCUMULATE YOUR INFLUENCES</p> <p>While we were talking, Jewel mentioned: Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Loretta Lynn, June Cash.</p> <p>But not just music. She quoted Brene Brown’s book, “Daring Greatly”. She quoted philosophers. She spoke about physics, about the neuroscience of sea slugs.</p> <p>Getting influenced (through reading or listening) is the way to absorb another person’s entire life and learn from it.</p> <p>Then you can combine it, throw in your own art and skills. And now you are on your way to world greatness.</p> <p>Is it that easy? I have no idea. I hope it is.</p> <p>H) FAME MAGNIFIES WHAT YOU HAVE</p> <p>It doesn’t add to who you are. It just magnifies it.</p> <p>If you are a jerk, you will be a bigger jerk. If you are someone who wants to improve yourself, you’ll have more opportunities to improve yourself.</p> <p>You have to be content with yourself first. Before fame.</p> <p>I have to admit, i am probably the biggest idiot ever. And when I first made money it magnified it in every way.</p> <p>I try now to like myself better. It’s not like I wake up and say, “I love you” to myself. Well, maybe sometimes.</p> <p>I) NO ONE CAN KEEP YOU CAPTIVE. NO ONE CAN KEEP YOU UNHAPPY</p> <p>In 2014, she went through a divorce. “I wanted my son to have the kind of mother I wanted to be.”</p> <p>At each step we have to decide if we are content with where we are. We get to choose and nobody else does. Whether it’s a spouse, or a recordd executive or a parent or a friend or whoever.</p> <p>“We’re like a car,” she said, “And the brain is just the steering wheel. We’re outside the brain. We get to steer the car.”</p> <p>Events can be good or bad. But we 100% get to choose whether or not we will be happy.</p> <p>J) CHANGE ONE THING ABOUT YOUR LIFE EVERY DAY</p> <p>This wasn’t in the podcast. It was in her book.</p> <p>I wanted to ask her about it. But I forgot. I always forget at least half the things I intend to ask about.</p> <p>But I like the idea of change every day. Even a little bit of change. We always have to explore.</p> <p>I was just reading that Haruki Murakami has kept the same writing routine for 24 years. Every day he wakes up at 5am, writes, runs, eats, etc.</p> <p>I like that. I like routine. But I want to make sure every day I do enough change that I can learn from it. Only then do I get new things to write about and think about it and improve from</p> <p>If I didn't do these podcasts, I'd probably talk to nobody all day long. But doing them forces me out the door to meet and learn from incredible people. And hopefully, to change a tiny bit.</p> <p>—-</p> <p>I’m completely selfish. I get to call up these amazing artists and get them to come to my podcast studio and ask them whatever questions I want</p> <p>They have to answer. I feel like this brutish monster forcing them to talk to me.</p> <p>But I learn from each one. And I fall in love a little bit with each guest.</p> <p>They all seem so smart and accomplished and confident. I even find myself jealous that Jewel was homeless for a little bit.</p> <p>What a great story!</p> <p>We posed for a picture with her book, "Never Broken" between us. "I'm still broken," I said. And she laughed.</p> <p>Then the picture snapped and she left.</p> </div>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jewel was broke and homeless, but she still turned down a million dollar check when she was 19 years old.</p> <p>Jewel was broke and millions in debt after selling 30,000,000 albums, and built back from scratch when she was 30.</p>  <p>Jewel has switched genres, written music from folk to pop to country to even children’s music. She wrote a children’s book.</p> <p>I love Jewel.</p> <p>Abused from the ages of 5 to 15. Moved out of the cold barn she was living in at 15 to live on her own. And three years later she was homeless.</p> <p>“I didn’t want to be a statistic,” she told me she was afraid when she was 15. “I looked around at other girls who were in my circumstances and things went from bad to worse”</p> <p>And yet… she ended up a statistic. She realized this when she was 18, living out of a car, and attempting to stuff a dress down her pants in a store so she could steal it.</p> <p>When I was 18 I feel I was privileged. I had no real worries. I was "suburban lucky". Luck ruined me and made me complacent. I never would have made the good decisions Jewel ended up making.</p> <p>That’s why I love her. That’s why I’m glad she came on my podcast. I’m sure she’s done 100s of interviews to promote her new book, “Never Broken”, an excellent book.</p> <p>But I wanted to break her down. I wanted her to laugh. She was so smart and serious. Trust me: I got her to laugh.</p> <p>A) HARD WOOD GROWS SLOWLY</p> <p>Why did a homeless girl who sang for pennies in a cafe turn down a million dollar offer?</p> <p>“Hard wood grows slowly,” she said. "I saw that as a kid. The soft trees would break. The hard trees would grow and live forever."</p> <p>She said: I knew I wanted to grow for a long time in this business. I also knew we were still in the grunge era and I was not grunge.</p> <p>If I took a million dollar deal, I read that I would have to pay it back. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to and I would be dropped by the label and that would be the end of my career.</p> <p>In fact, my album didn’t do well the first year. But then went on to sell over 10,000,000 copies.</p> <p>They didn’t drop me because I was just that girl they paid twelve dollars for. You have to think long-term instead of short-term always.</p> <p>—-</p> <p>She was 19.</p> <p>I do NOT think I would have made that decision. I think I would have made the wrong decisions.</p> <p>How does one take such a long term view at such a young age. I think it was the ten years she had spent developing her skills, singing in bars all over Alaska, preparing for this moment.</p> <p>Confidence is really difficult to develop. I don’t know if I have it even now. But I’m going to remember this lesson on the next business decision I have to make.</p> <p>B) REINVENTION IS NON-STOP</p> <p>Jewel has written children’s books, gone from folk music to pop to children’s to country. She’s been a rancher. She’s been homeless.</p> <p>I asked her, “You had the benefit of really cultivating your talent from ages 5 to 15. You sang with your dad at gigs every week.</p> <p>“Do you think someone starting from scratch at 50 can do this?”</p> <p>“Absolutely,” she said, “Reinvention never ends. It’s every day. Pursue what you enjoy and move towards it and there will be opportunities.”</p> <p>I look at my own life today. I’m about to finish a children’s book. I’m looking into TV. I’m working on a novel. I have other business things.</p> <p>I don’t know if any of them will work. But I know if I don’t keep trying I will slip back into whatever hole I constantly have to dig myself out of.</p> <p>There are two days to start something new. When you are five years old. And today.</p> <p>C) CREATE ART FOR YOURSELF</p> <p>I said these words: “So when you were talking to Neil Young…”</p> <p>What funny words to say to someone, I thought at the time and told her.</p> <p>Neil Young told her: don’t ever write for radio!</p> <p>Meaning: don’t write for the masses, write for yourself.</p> <p>I asked her, “isn’t there a tension there? Like what if you write for yourself and then nobody likes it? Don’t you want to write something that people like?”</p> <p>She said, “We all have common experiences. Ultimately when you write for yourself, you tap into that common cultural experience we all share.”</p> <p>That was eye-opening to me.</p> <p>If you put in the time to develop the skills, eventually you will burrow so deep inside yourself with your art that you will tap into that same vein of blood that runs through each of us.</p> <p>The key to good art is figuring out who you are.</p> <p>Writing for yourself, then, becomes the best way to write something that can be enjoyed by everyone.</p> <p>D) FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF.</p> <p>But, still, a relationship has to be earned back.</p> <p>Around the time she was 30, Jewel had sold tens of millions of albums, was doing 700 shows a year, and had no money.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You’re either horrible or miserable.</p> <p>Woody Allen has this joke in “Annie Hall.”</p> <p>He says,<em> </em><em>“Life is divided into the horrible and the miserable.</em></p> <p><em>That’s the two categories.</em></p> <p><em>The horrible are terminal cases. You know? And blind people, crippled… I don’t know how they get through life… It’s amazing to me.</em></p> <p><em>And the miserable is everyone else.</em></p> <p><em>So you should be thankful that you’re miserable. Because that’s very lucky… to be miserable.”</em></p> <p>I guess I’m one of the lucky ones. We complain about getting older or not having a passion, etc.</p> <p>“In relatively recent history—we’re talking the 1980s and later—we got convinced into believing we all have a capital P ‘Passion,’” Cal Newport said.</p> <p>Cal’s a tenured professor at Georgetown. And majored in computer science.</p> <p>So did I.</p> <p>Fact: You can’t pre-test a fetus to see what its passion will be.</p> <p>Passion is not in your DNA.</p> <p>I wasn’t born to podcast. Or write. Or be a father. I was just born…</p> <p>And I have eyes.</p> <p>So I see what other people are doing.</p> <p>I have ears. So I hear who’s winning. And then my brain asks, “Why am I here?”</p> <p>“People believe if we look inside ourselves and discover what our passion is, we’ll be happy. I studied this question in the book and that’s not how it happens,” Cal said. “Passion comes later.”</p> <p>First you have to “become so good you can’t be ignored…”</p> <p>1. Start with an interest</p> <p>Steve Martin reinvented stand-up. He told jokes without punchlines. And let the tension linger. He didn’t start with a passion for comedy.</p> <p>You start with an interest.</p> <p>I never thought, “Interviewing prostitutes at 3 a.m. is my passion.” But I got good at it.</p> <p>I was curious.</p> <p>And I’m still asking questions today.</p> <p>2. Build career capital</p> <p>Cal did a study. He found a database developer who became too good to be ignored. And used that as leverage.</p> <p>“She got into the computer industry with no background. At every stage, she said, ‘What would be valuable here?’”</p> <p>Now she spends 4-6 months working in her cubicle job. And the other  4-6 months in Thailand.</p> <p>Acquire career capital. And leverage it. This is how you get autonomy in the workplace.</p> <p>“It’s what lets you get a sense of mastery,” Cal said. “It’s what makes you get a sense of impact, and this is where passion actually comes from.”</p> <p>3. Focus on rare and valuable skills</p> <p>The first food truck was a pretzel stand. It had wheels and food.</p> <p>Now Michelin-star chefs have food trucks and pop-up shops. They didn’t learn how to make pretzels. Or follow the trend. They used rare and valuable skills to innovate the market.</p> <p>I built websites in the ‘90s. That was my first company. But as soon as I heard my eighth-grade sister was learning coding in school, I sold the company.</p> <p>Coding was no longer rare and valuable. And competition was about to explode.</p> <p>Control competition and you’ll control the market.</p> <p>4. Get to the cutting edge of an industry</p> <p>Mastery leads to passion, not the other way around.</p> <p>You weren’t “born” to invent the next iPhone. Nobody was. Even the people inventing the next iPhone weren’t born to invent the next iPhone.</p> <p>“Innovations don’t come at the very start of your journey.”</p> <p>You have to get to the cutting edge, learn what’s missing, identify room for growth and innovate.</p> <h1> </h1> <p>5. Do deep work</p> <p>Deep work is the process of becoming great.</p> <p>“It requires hard, hard focus and pushes your skill to its limit.”</p> <p>It’s what you do to become the best in your field. And discover holes in your organization. Or in the planet. It’s how you create ride-sharing, social networking, Google maps underwater.</p> <p>Cal says how at [16:04] </p> <p>6. Or don't... I asked Cal, “Do you think most people actually want to be really good at something…</p> <p>Or do most people just want more time off to just do nothing?”</p> <p>I don’t set goals. Or evaluate my growth.</p> <p>If I can support the growth of other people, cheer them on, smile and say, “Congratulations on getting up today,” then the window gets bigger.</p> <p>Maybe success isn’t “being so good you can’t be ignored.” Maybe it’s being so good you can’t ignore others.</p> <p>This is what works for me. This is my deep work.</p> <p> </p>]]></description>

I asked Cal, “Do you think most people actually want to be really good at something…</p> <p>Or do most people just want more time off to just do nothing?”</p> <p>I don’t set goals. Or evaluate my growth.</p> <p>If I can support the growth of other people, cheer them on, smile and say, “Congratulations on getting up today,” then the window gets bigger.</p> <p>Maybe success isn’t “being so good you can’t be ignored.” Maybe it’s being so good you can’t ignore others.</p> <p>This is what works for me. This is my deep work.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If I can tell my children to read one post of mine, it would be this post. Influence is how they will navigate a world of uncertainty.</p> <p>Robert Cialdini is the most influential person in the world. And by that I mean, he wrote the book, "INFLUENCE", which sold 3 million copies and defines the six critical aspects of all influence.</p> <p>Now he has a new book, "Pre-Suasion", going 10x deeper into the concepts of persuasion. I got him on my podcast so I can ask the 1000 questions I have.</p> <p>Small story from the book: If you name a restaurant "Studio 97" instead of "Studio 17" people are more likely to tip higher.</p> <p>If you ask a girl for her phone number outside a flower store (triggering feelings of romance), she is more likely to give it to you than if you ask her outside a motorcycle store.</p> <p>And 500 other stories. The environment is just as important as what you say.</p> <p>Before the podcast began, I gave him a book as a gift: "The Anxiety of Influence", a history of poetry.</p> <p>What would poetry have to do with influence and marketing?</p> <p>In all art, since the beginning of time, artists have built on the work of the artists the generation before them.</p> <p>Beethoven depended on a Mozart to be a Beethoven.

For instance, outline the negatives of dealing with you.<br /> - CONSISTENCY - ask someone for a favor. Now they will say to themselves, "I am the type of person who does James a favor".<br /> - SOCIAL PROOF - if you are trying to get someone to do X, show them that "a lot of your peers do X". For instance, if you are at a bar and you are a guy trying to meet women, being your women friends and not your guy friends with you.<br /> - AUTHORITY - "four out of five dentists say.."<br /> - SCARCITY - "only 100 iPhones left at this store!"<br /> - UNITY - you and I are the same because: location / values / religion / etc</p> <p>I've used each of the above in business.

I'm still running from the things I fear.</p> <p>So speak to influence. Don't speak to call a flower yellow. Speak to breathe spirit into an idea, to be enthusiastic, to convey emotion, to influence.

And 7 billion in the world. That’s 875 New York Cities. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">You can’t get ahead. Information is compounding. Technology is growing exponentially. Nothing is predictable—except maybe your expectations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not your success. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to complain. Now I pivot. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">“There is no try,” Yoda says. Hans Solo didn’t believe he could use the force. Trying is just a form of doubt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do or do not,” he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was 23, I tried figuring out how long it would take me to make a million dollars. I just bought computer. It was the first thing I bought with “hard-earned money.” </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Fast forward 25 years and I’ve thrown all my stuff away. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I’ve stopped trying to get ahead. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">I want an F in effort. And an A in not giving a shit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m writing because I’m writing. Not because I’m trying to write. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People make this mistake all the time. If you say, “James, what can I do to help you?” you’re doing two things right and one thing horribly wrong. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right: you’re good-intentioned (maybe) and you’re not hurting anyone (again, maybe). But here’s where you’re wrong… </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">And I’ve done this before too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve tried to be a good boss, a good employee, a good investor, but for all the wrong reasons. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only one good reason: you want to provide value. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t want to add value, you’re not helping. You’re hurting. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up, when my family argued, I’d ask, “Can I say something?” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Will it help?” my father would say. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">I didn’t answer. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Offering ideas is not valuable.

And I can tell you one thing for sure: when I did it for money, I failed 100% of the time. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Here’s the test... before you do anything, ask yourself this one question: “Do I want to add value?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">--</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s how I got Mark Cuban to come on my podcast,” I said. </span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Jenny Blake started a podcast.

It’s genuine. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s why it works. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She asked to interview me and provide value to you. Jenny’s an ex-Googler.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>By the time you finish reading this, everything I’m about to tell you will already be over.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you choose to do with it is up to you.</span></p> <p>Caleb Carr was beaten as a child. His father, Lucien Carr, was an Ivy League boy, friends with Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were the rebels of society. Known as The Beat Generation. But Caleb reminded me of their other legacy…</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My father gets arrested for murder. Jack gets arrested for accessory because he helped hide the weapon…”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then Burroughs, of course, shoots his wife down in Mexico.”</span></p> <p>“My father’s murder case gave their movement a type of darkness and gravitas it wouldn’t have otherwise had.”</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of these cycles, all of these abusive things are cyclical,” Caleb said.</span></p> <p>His father didn’t get the help he needed. He didn't get the help he needed. “It's one of the reasons I never had children myself.”</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t understand at first.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb has the awareness. He understands the cycle. So I asked, “Don't you think if you had children, you would have been able to hold yourself back?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I simply could not trust that,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">---</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As adults, we look at our lives and question what happened and why? We pick at our scabs and then wonder why we’re bleeding.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s done is done. And how you choose to live with it is your legacy.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Caleb writes. And between the intersection of abuse and history, he found relief.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb’s latest book, “Survivor, New York” begins with “The Curse of Knowledge,” It’s the idea that once you know something you can’t unknow it… pain, loss, grief.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No pain heals without air. Eventually, the bandaid gets soggy. And the cut below turns green.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s when I start reading. Caleb’s books are the air.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep reading to learn three lessons from the brilliant, historical novelist, Caleb Carr. Two will give you relief. One will not...</span></p> <p>1. History can save you.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people write thrillers. But Caleb wasn’t sure how he’d set himself apart. But he found a simple solution.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Training + Interest = Success</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb is a trained historian. He has an interest in serial killer novels. And now he’s a bestselling author. He writes historical thrillers where characters like Theodore Roosevelt and Alexander Hamilton rescue neglected children from serial killers.</span></p> <p>2. Pain reinvented is freedom.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb needed to write... (as all writers do).</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he didn’t want to write a memoir like his father’s pack. He tried it once. “I found the experience incredibly creepy.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So he found fiction.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb said he’s not depressed but feels “intense melancholia.”  “It’s a dark, dark place you go.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you able to function with it?” I asked.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh yeah,” he said, “that’s when I work.”</span></p> <p>3. Always end on a cliffhanger</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every unresolved problem in my life is a cliffhanger.Cliffhangers keep the story going. They create chaos. So I just stay curious.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caleb told me the warning signs of a serial killer: childhood violence, torture against animals, fires.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I loved starting fires,” he said. “I set my house on fire when I was four years old. It was the only time my father didn’t hit me.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I later asked if he has sociopathic tendencies… “functional sociopathic tendencies.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ummmm…”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was thinking about it.</span></p> <p> </p>]]></description>

He writes historical thrillers where characters like Theodore Roosevelt and Alexander Hamilton rescue neglected children from serial killers.</p> <p>2. Pain reinvented is freedom.</p> <p>Caleb needed to write... (as all writers do).</p> <p>But he didn’t want to write a memoir like his father’s pack. He tried it once. “I found the experience incredibly creepy.”</p> <p>So he found fiction.</p> <p>Caleb said he’s not depressed but feels “intense melancholia.”  “It’s a dark, dark place you go.”</p> <p>“Are you able to function with it?” I asked.</p> <p>“Oh yeah,” he said, “that’s when I work.”</p> <p>3. Always end on a cliffhanger</p> <p>Every unresolved problem in my life is a cliffhanger.Cliffhangers keep the story going. They create chaos. So I just stay curious.</p> <p>Caleb told me the warning signs of a serial killer: childhood violence, torture against animals, fires.</p> <p>“I loved starting fires,” he said. “I set my house on fire when I was four years old. It was the only time my father didn’t hit me.”</p> <p>I later asked if he has sociopathic tendencies… “functional sociopathic tendencies.”</p> <p>“Ummmm…”</p> <p>He was thinking about it.</p> <p> </p>]]></content:encoded>

They know how you think.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the mindset we want,” Jordan Harbinger said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was kidnapped twice. Once in Serbia. Once in Mexico.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He talked his way out both times. “We knew there was a problem,” he said.</span></p> <p>“The cop gets in my face and says, ‘In your country, can you walk around with no identification and no passport? Tell me the Goddamn truth.’”</p> <p>Jordan was in Serbia teaching refugees English.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, we don’t need any form of identification at all,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cop turned to his friend and in Serbian said, “I guess they really are free over there. I had no idea.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn’t know Jordan spoke Serbian.</span></p> <p>He ended up in a basement. Pipes were sticking out of the wall. There was no water for miles. Wires were everywhere. And Jordan was tied to a chair.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They threatened to burn his eyes with a cigarette.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guard had a club and rakia, a homebrewed liquor. Jordan talked his way out of going blind and into having a drink with his kidnapper.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always say advice is autobiography. Now Jordan’s made a career teaching ultimate survival skills through his podcast, “The Art of Charm.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked him, “How can I be more likable?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think you’re very likable…”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later he said I have “an un-punchable face.” And I agreed.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jordan was single, he saw a girl texting on the train. There was no cell service.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried guessing what he said to her, “‘I didn’t get your text, can you re-send it?’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, no that’s a great, pick-up line, but I wanted to disarm her. So I said something like, ‘Are you gonna write the whole book on your phone?’”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked him the top 5 takeaways from his podcast. He said everyone’s decision-making process is different. “Everyone gets to the top differently.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jordan’s interviewed world leaders like General Hayden, the former head of the NSA and CIA, Super Bowl MVP Hines Ward, and 500+ more.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all have stories.

			<title>Ep. 180 - A.J. Jacobs: Four Words That Will Give You Ultimate Freedom</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a restaurant with this beautiful, thick-cut bacon. The kind you use a knife and fork on.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had fat running through it. And I felt that feeling when you fall in love in junior high school.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend AJ Jacobs is going to prove bacon is the the path to immortality.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am very skeptical of health gurus,” he said. “You can find a study to support anything.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want him to find that study so I can eat bacon three times a day. And live forever doing it. I’d spend the rest of my life experimenting. That’s how AJ lives his life.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year, he does a new one. Then he writes about it. Most of our lives are lived in our head. Creation is when it leaks out.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s written four</span> <em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bestselling books. And he’s the editor-at-large for Esquire.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you don’t need permission. These four words will give you ultimate freedom to do anything you want: “It’s just an experiment.”</span></p> <p>Forget the gatekeepers. Just play.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ has done hundreds of experiments. He learns from them. So do I. Here are 3 lessons I learned from AJ’s hundreds of experiments:</span></p> <p>1) Filter negative thoughts</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe in authenticity. But I don’t believe in saying everything you think.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all the pain we created was just an accident, misunderstandings wouldn’t need explaining.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ stopped gossiping. He had to. It was part of an experiment. “There's a 1-800 number that Orthodox Jews have. It's like a suicide hotline, but for gossip.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How many people call that number a year?” I asked.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don't know. I called it and found it very helpful.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said his brain is lazy. Mine is, too. I have to watch it. It takes a lot of effort to clear out negative thoughts. But when AJ’s brain realized certain thoughts were being filtered, it stopped generating those thoughts.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started thinking more positively about people.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people don’t know they’re negative talkers. Or negative thinkers. Your brain is Jurassic Park occupied by predators. If you take care of yourself and filter them out, positive thoughts will filter through.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good people will want to be around you. The landscape will change. And new opportunities will come.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if you get the urge to gossip, call the hotline.</span></p> <p> </p> <p>2) Practice radical positive honesty</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ and his wife ran into some of her college friends at a restaurant. They said, “Oh, we should all get together.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But AJ didn’t want to. He was doing an experiment where he was being radically honest 100% of the time. “I had to say what was on my mind, which was, ‘You guys seem nice, but I just have no desire to ever see you again.’</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How did they react?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As you might expect, they were not overjoyed.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did your wife yell at you?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, absolutely, she yelled at me. In one sense it was effective because we’ve never seen them again.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know how she stays married to you.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AJ laughed. And we still got lunch after the podcast.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now he believes in radical positive honesty. I told AJ I’d try it.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Give it a shot. You're very handsome,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was lying.</span></p> <p>3) Don’t overlook anything</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the top 3 moments in AJ’s life was with Chrissy Teigen.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I already knew the story because he called me immediately after interviewing her.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were talking about religion and she randomly asked if he read “The Year of Living Biblically.”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t know he wrote it.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bible says you should say thanks all the time. I took it literally,” he said.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was one of his experiments.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would press the elevator button and be thankful it came to the first floor. Then I'd get in and be thankful it didn't plummet to the basement and break my collarbone. It was a very bizarre way to live, but it was also wonderful because you realize there are hundreds of things that go right every day that we totally take for granted.”</span></p>]]></description>

I have something better.</p> <p class="p1">I have Ramit Sethi, author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” and owner of iwillteachyoutoberich.com and growthlab.com. He’s been on my podcast before. Every time he’s on, people want to know this one thing:</p> <p class="p1">“HOW can I live a rich life?”</p> <p class="p1">I told Ramit, "The person listening to this doesn't want to hear that it's possible to get rich. Because that's what everybody says.

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was trying to cheer someone up. “The sun feels nice,” I said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t even notice those things,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was depressed. But I thought I could help.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say you can’t make everybody happy. But really, you can’t make anybody happy.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this. But it doesn’t always stop me from trying.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months ago, I did my first stand-up show. Now I have a new experiment</span><span style= "font-weight: 400;">. I take one photo a day. And I tell a story.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I haven't stopped thinking about stand-up. And I want to get better.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I interviewed Gary Gulman. He’s one of my favorite comedians. Top two. Him and Louis C.K. I’ll throw Amy Schumer into the mix. Top three. He started 23 years ago. And I’ve watched his Netflix series, “It’s About Time” twice (so far).</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to learn anything is to study the masters.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studying Gary taught me there are two steps to developing talent in anything:</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step 1: Start somewhere</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary first tried stand-up in 1993. But that’s not how he got started.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before that, he watched comedy. He repeated bits to friends and got laughs. That’s how all successes start. You just do it for fun.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s how Derek Sivers started CD Baby and how AirBnB began. They were experiments.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary only had five minutes on stage.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Back then I did impressions,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did one of Seinfeld and Kramer playing basketball.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But “within a year, I had decided that my impressions were not very good.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s step 2: Evolve.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doubt is a leader. It can take you away from what you don’t love and into what you do love.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s how I got on the track I’m on now,” he says.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re “good,” you’ll just sit back. And someone who’s no good will get better.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They’ll get a mentor</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They’ll reinvent themselves</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They’ll practice for 10,000+ hours</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- They build a love for it</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the “good” ones don’t evolve, they’ll remain just that… good.</span></p> <p> </p> <ol> <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">C) Tell your story</span></li> </ol> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have symptoms of depression,” he said. “I almost feel like I'm moving in slow motion. There doesn't seem to be any amount of sleep that satisfies me.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t sugar coat it. It sounds miserable. But it’s also the source of his comedy.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess if I didn't have a depressive view of the world, I wouldn't have the premises to go off,” he said.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But at the same time, if I didn't have the depressive nature, I would have more confidence and more energy to write more and maybe expand into more acting or podcasting or writing a book.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a balance.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On the days you get out of it, how do you get yourself out of it?” I asked.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a long pause.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or have you never gotten out of it?” I asked.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to find out what works for him.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it came back to helping people.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stand-up comedy gave me a lot of reward,” he said, “as far as making people feel a little bit better and forgetting about their problems for a short time.”</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turns pain into humor, which morphs back into pain.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That pain becomes a bit. And that bit becomes a laugh.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t make people happy. But if you tell your story, maybe you can make them laugh.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Imagine… If you had suddenly learned that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse— had never been.”</p> <p>I was in LA at Imagine Entertainment.</p> <p>It’s Brian Grazer’s studio. He produced A Beautiful Mind, 8 Mile, a bunch of Jim Carrey movies. He’s worked with Eddie Murphy and produced my favorite TV series, Arrested Development.</p> <p>“I bought the book A Beautiful Mind with the thematic intention of trying to make a movie that would help de-stigmatize mental disability,” he said.</p> <p>So he created an alternate reality. And he’s done this in his own life.</p> <p>“You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what’s true,” the psychiatrist said in A Beautiful Mind. He was talking to John Nash’s wife as she watched her husband get electroshock therapy.</p> <p>She loved a schizophrenic man. A brilliant man.</p> <p>She let me him keep his delusions.</p> <p>They weren’t real. But what’s the harm?</p> <p>Nothing. Unless you almost drown your baby.</p> <p>He won the Nobel Prize.</p> <p>And I cried.</p> <p>His mind brought him delusions but it also brought him love.</p> <p>Between two realities, he chose himself.</p> <p>I don’t try to be everything I am.</p> <p>Because some of me is jealous.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Imagine… If you had suddenly learned that the people and the places and the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse— had never been.”</p> <p>I was in LA at Imagine Entertainment.</p> <p>It’s Brian Grazer’s studio. He produced A Beautiful Mind, 8 Mile, a bunch of Jim Carrey movies. He’s worked with Eddie Murphy and produced my favorite TV series, Arrested Development.</p> <p>“I bought the book A Beautiful Mind with the thematic intention of trying to make a movie that would help de-stigmatize mental disability,” he said.</p> <p>So he created an alternate reality. And he’s done this in his own life.</p> <p>“You see, the nightmare of schizophrenia is not knowing what’s true,” the psychiatrist said in A Beautiful Mind. He was talking to John Nash’s wife as she watched her husband get electroshock therapy.</p> <p>She loved a schizophrenic man. A brilliant man.</p> <p>She let me him keep his delusions.</p> <p>They weren’t real. But what’s the harm?</p> <p>Nothing. Unless you almost drown your baby.</p> <p>He won the Nobel Prize.</p> <p>And I cried.</p> <p>His mind brought him delusions but it also brought him love.</p> <p>Between two realities, he chose himself.</p> <p>I don’t try to be everything I am.</p> <p>Because some of me is jealous. Some of me feels sad. Some of me ran out of things to say.</p> <p>So I become the rest of me. The side that practices difficult gratitude and improves just 1% a day. The part of me that listens. And flies to LA to be in an alternate reality.</p> <p>Brian Grazer says, “Curiosity propels storytelling. All stories, incidentally, need propulsion.

<p>“Don't scare me.”</p>
<p>I was laughing. But I meant it.</p>
<p>The news, the doom and gloom, the fear, it makes fresh air turn
to vomit.</p>
<p>Chunky streams of acid.</p>
<p>I bet Ron Paul has thin stomach lining.</p>
<p>We were talking about freedom. And if there’s any left.</p>
<p>I usually ignore all the doom and gloom. That’s what works for
me. But we talked about opportunities, hope, trends, the
innovation economy. </p>
<p>And freedom.</p>
<p>“I don't even like politics. I did it only because I could get a
voice out there telling people what was going on, what you need to
do, and what the substitute has to be. Believe me, we're going to
have a chance,” Ron Paul says on today’s podcast.</p>
<p>Did you hear that?</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a chance…”</p>
<p>I like that.</p>
<p>If you pay attention, you’ll see the future is already
here. </p>
<p>What does that mean for you?</p>
<p>I don’t know. Maybe you’ll go to space or make millions
investing in robotics.</p>
<p>You have thousands of new opportunities to create your
own wealth and freedom.</p>
<p>And you can start right now. </p>
<p>I'll tell you how to make money off of rising trends in today’s
podcast. This is rare. But you’ll hear about my plan to profit
in this innovation economy.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>I would’ve taken the money. A couple hundred million.</p>
<p>He could’ve sold the business for a 100, 200 million
dollars.</p>
<p>Bill Gates wanted to buy it.</p>
<p>But he didn’t sell.</p>
<p>I wanted to know why Steve Case, co-founder and former CEO of
AOL said no to being a millionaire.</p>
<p>“The simple answer is I really believed in the idea of the
internet and believed in AOL and believed that it could change the
world,” he says on today’s podcast.</p>
<p>Investors said, “What are you talking about? This internet
thing? Why would normal people ever want to get connected to
this?”</p>
<p>People thought he was crazy crazy. But he could see the
future.</p>
<p>That’s the thing about the future. Nobody wants to see it
coming.</p>
<p>Back then, nobody wanted to connect to the internet.</p>
<p>They missed opportunities.</p>
<p>“It was a hard struggle for a decade before we finally broke
through,” he said. The future paid off for Steve Case. And now it
can pay off for you.</p>
<p>He believed they could change the world.</p>
<p>He was right. “Six, seven years later, [AOL] had gone from a few
hundred million dollars to tens of billions to then over 150, 160
billion.”</p>
<p>But he didn’t stop there…</p>
<p>The Third Wave is coming. Steve talks about it in his New York
Times bestselling book, The Third Wave: An Entrepreneur's
Vision of the Future.</p>
<p>These are the opportunities you haven’t missed yet.</p>
<p>We’re offering you the future.</p>
<p>In my interview with Steve Case, you’ll learn about the first
wave (building the internet), the second wave (social media,
community, Facebook, Snapchat… all the billion dollar companies you
wish you thought of or invested in…)</p>
<p>And finally, the third wave. The future.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>“Everyday is a new day.” ...unless you have a routine.</p>
<p>Then it's just “eat, sleep, shit, repeat,” like they say in Billions.</p>
<p>"Don't you want to create memories? Don't you want to build your life resume and get as much out of life as you can?” Jesse Itzler said on my podcast.</p>
<p>He's the co-founder of Marquis Jets, owner of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, endurance athlete, former-rapper and now he's an author.</p>
<p>"I didn't have a resume," he says. "I didn't want to have a resume. I didn't want to work for anybody."</p>
<p>Jesse built his life.</p>
<p>"I had no background, no experience and I had no connections."</p>
<p>He's self-made.</p>
<p>I don’t know who’s in charge of my life. Maybe me. I chose myself.</p>
<p>And I still do. Everyday.</p>
<p>But I also lend my life out. At least once every 24 hours.</p>
<p>“We're constantly dodging arrows,” Jesse said. “Each arrow is time.”</p>
<p>“Routines are great, but they're also a rut,” he said.</p>
<p>“I thought wow, this is amazing. I have great balance. I have a great routine. I'm in my routine. Everything is my routine…”</p>
<p>And he needed to get out of it.</p>
<p>So he did something crazy, which you’ll hear on today’s episode.</p>
<p>And you’ll learn his tricks to becoming self-made.</p>
<p>Then you can enjoy your life. I hope. And forget your resume too.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before writing this, I closed my eyes. I allowed myself to rest. I went from, “think, think, think” to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And nothing felt good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing worked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is my success. Today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to have another kind of success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was a hedge fund manager, web developer, producer, investor, corporate employee, CEO, writer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still do some of these jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not because “they” tell me to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look back and see desperation. I was desperate to secure my future. My income. My relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was always a risk of getting fired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I knew my then-wife could decide she didn’t love me anymore. My kids could, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was shrinking. Physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually shrinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought if I was miserable, “they” would help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bled out on the floor.  And then I chose myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I do the daily practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I experiment. I find what works for me. And I write about it. Because advice is autobiography.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But something is still stopping me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, if you've read to here, I bet there’s something stopping you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">you learn one thing today, I hope it’s this: experiment everyday.</span></p>
<p>The steps are:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay Attention. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if it doesn’t work out how you imagined, then you’ll have a better story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I got evicted last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day, I did this interview with Charles Duhigg. You'll hear it in the podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles is a Pulitzer Prize winner and the author of two </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bestselling books, The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better: The Secrets of Being Productive in Life and Business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting doesn’t work for me. But I tried it. It was a successful experiment with a failed result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m finding what works for me everyday. Charles says that’s what the most productive people do. They cycle through systems.</span></p>
<p>Charles cycled. He wasn’t always smarter, better, faster.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I would come home every night and tell my wife, ‘If this is what success feels like, sign me up for failure.’ It was killing me,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very easy to lose sight of the ‘why,’” he says. “[We] lose track of why we’re doing something, how it links up to our deepest values or our biggest aspirations... what we actually want to do with our life.”</span></p>
<p>This interview might teach you something about experimenting, or focussing, or motivation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might teach you nothing.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, nothing is a lesson, too.</span></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>He didn’t have permission.</p>
<p>But he did it anyway. And one day Elon Musk called him.</p>
<p>“He was either going to make life really horrible on me or he was going to cooperate with the book” said Ashlee Vance, author of the New York Times bestseller and Wall Street Journal’s “best books of the year,” Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.</p>
<p>Ashlee did 200 interviews before Elon agreed, proving permission is not a starting place.</p>
<p>I wish I wrote the book. But I didn’t.</p>
<p>My “quest” is different.</p>
<p>Instead, I mastered curiosity.</p>
<p>I called people and recorded. I did a ton of research. I read every book, article, interview and watched every talk. I’ve spent 10,000 hours interviewing and more than 10,000 hours preparing.</p>
<p>I didn’t need permission. And neither do you.</p>
<p>Here are 5 ways to bypass the gatekeepers:</p>
<p>A) Master something</p>
<p>Like anybody, Elon is smart in some things and probably stupid in others. But he mastered his interests.</p>
<p>Mastery is learning 90% of everything you could learn about a subject. You can’t reach 100%. I hope that’s comforting.</p>
<p>Explore your interests. Combine them and you’ll find what works for you. Then improve 1% each day.</p>
<p>Along the way, you’ll master it.</p>
<p>B) Make your own decisions</p>
<p>Elon doesn't let people make decisions for him. They’ll choose wrong. And he knows it.</p>
<p>If you choose for yourself you will choose yourself.</p>
<p>C) Play for pay</p>
<p>I remember my childhood. Some of it. I read comic books and Dear Abby.</p>
<p>Now, at 47? 48? I search for “superhero” stories.</p>
<p>And I get to be Dear Abby.</p>
<p>“Ask Altucher.”</p>
<p>Every Thursday at 3:30 PM EST, I have a Twitter Q&A.</p>
<p>I answer texts and emails from strangers. 203-512-2161</p>
<p>I answer Quora questions and co-host a podcast with my friend, Stephen Dubner. He wrote the New York Times bestseller, Freakonomics.</p>
<p>I wonder if he read Dear Abby growing up, too. We answer questions with questions.</p>
<p>But before all of this, I worked in finance. I did what “they” wanted me to do. I got lost.</p>
<p>Elon did, too.</p>
<p>“He just got swept up in the internet for a little while,” Ashlee says, “and then once he made a ton of money (from PayPal), the light went on and he just said, ‘Now I can go chase everything I've ever wanted to go do.’”</p>
<p>“Elon appears to have some kind of calling to go save humankind,” Ashlee says. “When he was 12, he designed a video game that was exactly that concept.”</p>
<p>But at one point, he changed course. We all do. We forget play.</p>
<p>Now he’s saving humanity.</p>
<p>D) There are always problems</p>
<p>When I interviewed Derek Sivers last week, I said “You can always disappear from your problems.”</p>
<p>And you can.</p>
<p>He did. But then what?</p>
<p>Derek spends a lot time answering emails and giving advice. And Elon is exploring electric vehicles and life in space.</p>
<p>Everyday, I have a choice: find new problems or help others with theirs. Create problems or solve them.</p>
<p>When I help people with their problems, I forget about mine. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Elon sees extreme problems and extreme solutions. All his basics are covered. He’s doesn’t worry about his boss or the mortgage.</p>
<p>“The weird thing to me,” Ashlee says, “was that [when] you started talking [to Elon] about mankind being wiped out, he wells up with emotion.”</p>
<p>Suffering graces all life. There are always problems.</p>
<p>“What I saw with Elon is that he's very clear-eyed. He meditates on what he thinks is important and has a absolute devotion to pursuing these goals”</p>
<p>“He gives you a sense of urgency in your life. Maybe I'm just getting older,” Ashlee says, “When I finished doing the book, I sat back and I said, ‘I need to be much clearer about exactly what I want to do with my life.’”</p>
<p>I don’t have the same problem as Ashlee or see the same problems as Elon Musk. And I’m grateful.</p>
<p>E) Be on the right side of history</p>
<p>You only have a certain amount of energy each day. Don’t waste it fighting the inevitable.</p>
<p>“Going against Elon is the equivalent of going against Steve Jobs these days and you come out looking kind of foolish,” Ashlee says. <br /> Instead, focus on building your idea muscle. Do one thing everyday that makes you physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually healthy.</p>
<p>Elon Musk is changing the state of our future. Of all mankind. Who gave him permission? He did. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The most powerful currency in the world is not what you think.</p>
<p class="p2">Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p2">We're turning to a new economy with two powerful currencies.</p>
<p class="p2">And you have an opportunity, right now, to build a more fulfilling and rewarding life.</p>
<p class="p2">I'm going to tell you what these two currencies are and how to leverage them successfully. I'll tell you what works for me.</p>
<p class="p2">But before I do, I want to introduce you to Derek Sivers. He's an influential thinker, speaker, entrepreneur and the zen master of entrepreneurship writing.</p>
<p class="p2">If you're starting a business, you have to read his book, Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur. It's in my top three.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek built his business, CD Baby, around doing people favors. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100M in sales for 150,000 musicians.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek later sold CD Baby for $22M and gave the proceeds to charity. "If you focus entirely on others the world seems to reward you the most," he says.</p>
<p class="p2">That's one of the two most powerful currencies today: favors.</p>
<p class="p2">But there are limits.</p>
<p class="p2">"You have to serve others within the limits of what you're able to sustainably do. You can't do something that makes you absolutely miserable," he says.</p>
<p class="p2">That's choosing yourself.</p>
<p class="p2">I got a lot of ideas from interviewing Derek, which is the other currency: ideas. But you already knew that.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek moved to New Zealand. He takes 3-day hikes, spends 30 hours a week with his family, and answers thousands of personal emails asking for his advice.</p>
<p class="p2">He wrote a list of his priorities and said "I don't want to do anything else right now. (No more interviews or speaking at conferences until further notice.)" This is his last interview for awhile.</p>
<p class="p2">I'm grateful he chose me. Chose us.</p>
<p class="p2">And chose himself.</p>
<p class="p2">I encourage you to write him.</p>
<p class="p2">And listen to this interview. Share what you learned.  I wrote a list -- 7 ways to a "make a killing" and master the new economy.</p>
<p class="p2">Because Derek quoted Kevin Kelly, futurist and founder of Wired. He said, "We should focus on making a living, not on making something huge."</p>
<p class="p2">Derek changed it to "It's about making a living, not making a killing."</p>
<p class="p2">To me, that's success in the new economy.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>7 ways to a "make a killing" and master the new economy:</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>A) Leave in the cracks</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Derek was listening to Sheryl Crow. But he didn’t know it was her. Her voice cracked. And she got his attention. "That little fault is what made me like her," Derek said.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>B) Admit your faults</strong></p>
<p class="p2">I know I'm bad at a lot of things. Derek gave an example. When I interviewed Ramit Sethi, I admitted I forgot to read something. And I wasn't totally prepared.</p>
<p class="p2">"To me it kind of seems like a brilliant way of asking the world to love you," Derek said.</p>
<p class="p2">And maybe it is.</p>
<p class="p2">Everyone wants love. How sad is it that we, as humans, contemplate hiding ourselves?</p>
<p class="p2">We have two choices: be yourself or fear being yourself.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>C) You can always disappear from your problems</strong></p>
<p class="p2">But do you want to? Did Kurt Cobain kill himself because he was too famous? Or because he got everything he wanted? And didn’t know what to do with it.</p>
<p class="p2">We always want things. Happiness, love, appreciation.</p>
<p class="p2">But then do we ask for the right things? Raises, promotions, more responsibility, less freedom?</p>
<p class="p2">You can choose f-ck you money and f-ck you problems. Or you can focus on happiness. That’s what Derek did.</p>
<p class="p2">He had a company, CD Baby. It’s basically the original iTunes. People said he’d get a lot of money with an IPO. But he didn’t do it.</p>
<p class="p2">"What's the point of making money?" Derek said, "It's to be happy."</p>
<p class="p2">"And if it would make me unhappy to have so much responsibility then I'd rather not make more money. I'd rather just focus on the happiness."</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>D) Do more favors</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Anyone can do this.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek started by selling old CDs online.</p>
<p class="p2">He made money right away. So people asked for favors. Can you sell my old CDs?</p>
<p class="p2">He said yes. And it spread. Friends of friends asked. Then strangers and soon he had a profitable business.</p>
<p class="p2">But do it for yourself first. Learn the skill. Then, do it as a favor for someone else. See if more people ask. And then you have a business that cost you no money to create.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>E) Answer asks</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Derek didn’t offer to sell his friend’s CDs. They asked him.</p>
<p class="p2">"By doing favors for people it implies that people are asking you to do those favors and to me the key is the asking," he says. "Bluntly put, you shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to."</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>F) Passion is poison</strong></p>
<p class="p2">Only search for passion if searching for passion is your passion.</p>
<p class="p2">We're brainwashed to believe we're not alive. That we need a purpose. But you're alive.</p>
<p class="p2">Passion or no passion, you are alive.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek says, "Instead, just follow the little things that interest you. Just notice on a day-to-day basis what you're drawn towards."</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>G) Only have good goals</strong></p>
<p class="p2">That's how Derek became "a writer, speaker, thinker kind of guy."</p>
<p class="p2">The idea came to him. And suddenly he was inspired. "I put so much work into this and then within nine months I was speaking at TED in front of Bill Gates, Larry Page and all these intimidating people."</p>
<p class="p2">He says, "A good goal is one that actually changes your actions in the moment. Goals are not about the future," he says. "Goals are about changing the present moment, changing your present actions."</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The most powerful currency in the world is not what you think.</p>
<p class="p2">Not anymore.</p>
<p class="p2">We're turning to a new economy with two powerful currencies.</p>
<p class="p2">And you have an opportunity, right now, to build a more fulfilling and rewarding life.</p>
<p class="p2">I'm going to tell you what these two currencies are and how to leverage them successfully. I'll tell you what works for me.</p>
<p class="p2">But before I do, I want to introduce you to Derek Sivers. He's an influential thinker, speaker, entrepreneur and the zen master of entrepreneurship writing.</p>
<p class="p2">If you're starting a business, you have to read his book, Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur. It's in my top three.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek built his business, CD Baby, around doing people favors. It became the largest seller of independent music online, with $100M in sales for 150,000 musicians.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek later sold CD Baby for $22M and gave the proceeds to charity. "If you focus entirely on others the world seems to reward you the most," he says.</p>
<p class="p2">That's one of the two most powerful currencies today: favors.</p>
<p class="p2">But there are limits.</p>
<p class="p2">"You have to serve others within the limits of what you're able to sustainably do. You can't do something that makes you absolutely miserable," he says.</p>
<p class="p2">That's choosing yourself.</p>
<p class="p2">I got a lot of ideas from interviewing Derek, which is the other currency: ideas. But you already knew that.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek moved to New Zealand. He takes 3-day hikes, spends 30 hours a week with his family, and answers thousands of personal emails asking for his advice.</p>
<p class="p2">He wrote a list of his priorities and said "I don't want to do anything else right now. (No more interviews or speaking at conferences until further notice.)" This is his last interview for awhile.</p>
<p class="p2">I'm grateful he chose me. Chose us.</p>
<p class="p2">And chose himself.</p>
<p class="p2">I encourage you to write him.</p>
<p class="p2">And listen to this interview. Share what you learned.  I wrote a list -- 7 ways to a "make a killing" and master the new economy.</p>
<p class="p2">Because Derek quoted Kevin Kelly, futurist and founder of Wired. He said, "We should focus on making a living, not on making something huge."</p>
<p class="p2">Derek changed it to "It's about making a living, not making a killing."</p>
<p class="p2">To me, that's success in the new economy.</p>
<p class="p2">7 ways to a "make a killing" and master the new economy:</p>
<p class="p2">A) Leave in the cracks</p>
<p class="p2">Derek was listening to Sheryl Crow. But he didn’t know it was her. Her voice cracked. And she got his attention. "That little fault is what made me like her," Derek said.</p>
<p class="p2">B) Admit your faults</p>
<p class="p2">I know I'm bad at a lot of things. Derek gave an example. When I interviewed Ramit Sethi, I admitted I forgot to read something. And I wasn't totally prepared.</p>
<p class="p2">"To me it kind of seems like a brilliant way of asking the world to love you," Derek said.</p>
<p class="p2">And maybe it is.</p>
<p class="p2">Everyone wants love. How sad is it that we, as humans, contemplate hiding ourselves?</p>
<p class="p2">We have two choices: be yourself or fear being yourself.</p>
<p class="p2">C) You can always disappear from your problems</p>
<p class="p2">But do you want to? Did Kurt Cobain kill himself because he was too famous? Or because he got everything he wanted? And didn’t know what to do with it.</p>
<p class="p2">We always want things. Happiness, love, appreciation.</p>
<p class="p2">But then do we ask for the right things? Raises, promotions, more responsibility, less freedom?</p>
<p class="p2">You can choose f-ck you money and f-ck you problems. Or you can focus on happiness. That’s what Derek did.</p>
<p class="p2">He had a company, CD Baby. It’s basically the original iTunes. People said he’d get a lot of money with an IPO. But he didn’t do it.</p>
<p class="p2">"What's the point of making money?" Derek said, "It's to be happy."</p>
<p class="p2">"And if it would make me unhappy to have so much responsibility then I'd rather not make more money. I'd rather just focus on the happiness."</p>
<p class="p2">D) Do more favors</p>
<p class="p2">Anyone can do this.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek started by selling old CDs online.</p>
<p class="p2">He made money right away. So people asked for favors. Can you sell my old CDs?</p>
<p class="p2">He said yes. And it spread. Friends of friends asked. Then strangers and soon he had a profitable business.</p>
<p class="p2">But do it for yourself first. Learn the skill. Then, do it as a favor for someone else. See if more people ask. And then you have a business that cost you no money to create.</p>
<p class="p2">E) Answer asks</p>
<p class="p2">Derek didn’t offer to sell his friend’s CDs. They asked him.</p>
<p class="p2">"By doing favors for people it implies that people are asking you to do those favors and to me the key is the asking," he says. "Bluntly put, you shouldn't start a business unless people are asking you to."</p>
<p class="p2">F) Passion is poison</p>
<p class="p2">Only search for passion if searching for passion is your passion.</p>
<p class="p2">We're brainwashed to believe we're not alive. That we need a purpose. But you're alive.</p>
<p class="p2">Passion or no passion, you are alive.</p>
<p class="p2">Derek says, "Instead, just follow the little things that interest you. Just notice on a day-to-day basis what you're drawn towards."</p>
<p class="p2">G) Only have good goals</p>
<p class="p2">That's how Derek became "a writer, speaker, thinker kind of guy."</p>
<p class="p2">The idea came to him. And suddenly he was inspired. "I put so much work into this and then within nine months I was speaking at TED in front of Bill Gates, Larry Page and all these intimidating people."</p>
<p class="p2">He says, "A good goal is one that actually changes your actions in the moment. Goals are not about the future," he says. "Goals are about changing the present moment, changing your present actions."</p>

			<title>Ep. 156 - Barbara Corcoran: 5 Signs You're Meant to be an Entrepreneur</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I never thought about sex with Barbara Corcoran. I still don't. But she brought it up.</p>
<p class="p1">We were talking about entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="p1">And she said how old she was when she lost her virginity.</p>
<p class="p1">Twenty-three.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I wanted to know how she </span>turned a thousand dollars into a five billion dollar company.</p>
<p class="p3">Then: $1,000.</p>
<p class="p3">Now: $5,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="p3">I wanted to know how she founded The Corcoran Group, the largest company in <span class="s2">real estate</span>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">And how you become </span>the type of entrepreneur Barbara Corcoran chooses on Shark Tank.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to get Barbara’s investment.</p>
<p class="p3">If that’s what you want.</p>
<p class="p3">But not<span class="s1"> everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur. According to Barbara.</span> "I found a real difference between the superstars and everyone else," she says. <span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And I agree. That’s why I wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1517088720/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><span class="s4"><em>The Rich Employee</em></span></a>. Entrepreneurship isn’t everything.</p>
<p class="p1">But it can be.</p>
<p class="p1">Barbara reviews thousands of investment opportunities. And most hear "no." </p>
<p class="p3">She says you have to have "a nose for entrepreneurship." That’s how you get a "yes," from Barbara Corcoran.</p>
<p class="p3">But before you start doubting yourself, take the test.</p>
<p class="p3">You’ll find out how in this interview. Jump to <strong>[39:25</strong>].</p>
<p class="p3">It’s scary. She says, if you weren’t born with "it," (the nose for entrepreneurship, the "innate intelligence,") then "you shouldn't be an entrepreneur in the first place."<span class="s2"> </span></p>
<p class="p6">And you need specific characteristics:</p>
<p class="p6"><strong>A) Handle rejection.</strong></p>
<p class="p6">You can't cry. Or feel sorry for yourself.</p>
<p class="p6">The top people in Barbara’s company made four million dollars a year in commissions. They took hits. Just as many as the others. Or more. "<span class="s3">Because they were trying for more," she says, "But the real difference was how long they took to feel sorry for themselves."</span></p>
<p class="p6">Get over rejection. And try again.</p>
<p class="p6"><strong>B) Conserve energy.</strong></p>
<p class="p3">Monitor yourself.</p>
<p class="p3">Just notice.</p>
<p class="p3">I feel tired. Why? I'm not motivated. I’m drained. Burnt out. Why?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I never thought about sex with Barbara Corcoran. I still don't. But she brought it up.</p>
<p class="p1">We were talking about entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="p1">And she said how old she was when she lost her virginity.</p>
<p class="p1">Twenty-three.</p>
<p class="p3">I wanted to know how she turned a thousand dollars into a five billion dollar company.</p>
<p class="p3">Then: $1,000.</p>
<p class="p3">Now: $5,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="p3">I wanted to know how she founded The Corcoran Group, the largest company in real estate.</p>
<p class="p1">And how you become the type of entrepreneur Barbara Corcoran chooses on Shark Tank.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to get Barbara’s investment.</p>
<p class="p3">If that’s what you want.</p>
<p class="p3">But not everyone is meant to be an entrepreneur. According to Barbara. "I found a real difference between the superstars and everyone else," she says.  </p>
<p class="p1">And I agree. That’s why I wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1517088720/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><em>The Rich Employee</em></a>. Entrepreneurship isn’t everything.</p>
<p class="p1">But it can be.</p>
<p class="p1">Barbara reviews thousands of investment opportunities. And most hear "no." </p>
<p class="p3">She says you have to have "a nose for entrepreneurship." That’s how you get a "yes," from Barbara Corcoran.</p>
<p class="p3">But before you start doubting yourself, take the test.</p>
<p class="p3">You’ll find out how in this interview. Jump to [39:25].</p>
<p class="p3">It’s scary. She says, if you weren’t born with "it," (the nose for entrepreneurship, the "innate intelligence,") then "you shouldn't be an entrepreneur in the first place." </p>
<p class="p6">And you need specific characteristics:</p>
<p class="p6">A) Handle rejection.</p>
<p class="p6">You can't cry. Or feel sorry for yourself.</p>
<p class="p6">The top people in Barbara’s company made four million dollars a year in commissions. They took hits. Just as many as the others. Or more. "Because they were trying for more," she says, "But the real difference was how long they took to feel sorry for themselves."</p>
<p class="p6">Get over rejection. And try again.</p>
<p class="p6">B) Conserve energy.</p>
<p class="p3">Monitor yourself.</p>
<p class="p3">Just notice.</p>
<p class="p3">I feel tired. Why? I'm not motivated. I’m drained. Burnt out. Why?</p>
<p class="p3">Your energy leaks out. Through fear, regret, negative people, bad situations.</p>
<p class="p3">Conserve it. Refocus. And put it to good use. </p>
<p class="p6">C) You shouldn’t quit your job</p>
<p class="p3">I ran my side business for 18 months before quitting my full-time job.</p>
<p class="p3">I had eleven employees.</p>
<p class="p3">But I’m not special. Really. Because that’s what all of Barbara's "successful" entrepreneurs do. They keep their jobs. </p>
<p class="p3">D) You need to be "hungry, mean and insecure."</p>
<p class="p3">"That's been my track record with the businesses I've invested," she says. You need to have something to prove.</p>
<p class="p3">But nice is ok for me. I’ll take nice. </p>
<p class="p3">E) Daydream.</p>
<p class="p3">"Vision is daydreaming and seeing yourself in a role and seeing what your business is going to become," she says.</p>
<p class="p3">Picture it. Use your imagination. Escape into the dream.</p>
<p class="p3">She says, "I don't know any entrepreneurs who don't visualize."</p>
<p class="p3">Listen to today's episode. Are you really an entrepreneur? </p>
<p class="p3">Maybe you don’t know.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I’d rather be an alien.</p>
<p class="p1">I’d rather be myself. Than be liked.</p>
<p class="p1">It makes sense… why you’d want to be liked.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about it. From an evolutionary standpoint, when you’re liked, you’re safe.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re in the tribe. People protect you.</p>
<p class="p1">But now, I’d rather be an alien. I don’t want stress. I don’t want to worry, “Do I fit in?”</p>
<p class="p1">There are consequences to being liked.</p>
<p class="p1">You start compromising. You stop taking risks. You follow the herd.</p>
<p class="p1">You get stuck in a crappy job at a fluorescently lit cubicle. Where they can watch you.</p>
<p class="p1">You stop taking risks. You wonder, “Is this ok?”</p>
<p class="p1">Ok to who? Not you. Not the only person who matters.</p>
<p class="p1">I’d rather be an alien. If I’m an alien, I can act like I just landed here. And I’m not supposed to know if I fit in.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m forced to be myself. No trying. Just forced. I can surrender.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest today, used to be in a tribe.</p>
<p class="p1">I won’t say it’s the worst one. But it’s bad.</p>
<p class="p1">Turney Duff is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of, <em>The Buy Side: A Wall Street Trader's Tale of Spectacular Excess,</em> where he tells the truth. He bleeds.</p>
<p class="p1">"Look, chances are people aren't going to like me after I tell the story, so at no point am I ever, ever, ever going to try to get the reader to like me,” Turney says.</p>
<p class="p1">But that wasn’t easy. Because he spent his whole life trying to be liked.</p>
<p class="p1">“I've always had this 'Nobody loves me' syndrome. I had this fear of ordinary, fear of being normal.”</p>
<p class="p1">On Wall Street, Turney was a trader.</p>
<p class="p1">But he wasn’t just trading stocks. He traded sleep, health, relationships, money. All of it for drugs.</p>
<p class="p1">He was afraid.</p>
<p class="p1">He’d go to hotel rooms and snort cocaine by himself.</p>
<p class="p1">But nothing was enough.</p>
<p class="p1">He made $2 million dollars a year. He thought, “If I could just make three million dollars a year, all of my problems would be solved."</p>
<p class="p1">But before that he said, “If I could just make fifty thousand dollars a year, all of my problems would be solved. All of them."</p>
<p class="p1">He wanted to be a journalist. But he traded.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of people trade. Maybe you traded.</p>
<p class="p1">But it’s not too late. You can choose yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">There are three things you need to know to choose yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">And I got these from my interview with Turney. He’ll show you. He’ll prove to you it’s not too late.</p>
<p class="p1">I believe in you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Three steps to (finally) choose yourself:</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1) Don’t try to be liked.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">When Turney wrote this book, he knew people would stop liking him. Or hate him.</p>
<p class="p1">He told it anyway. And it saved his life. </p>
<p class="p1">That’s what saved my life too. Bleeding on the pages. Telling my truth.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen at [2:35] to learn how to cure something in yourself too.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2) Want less.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Wanting more hurts. Because you trick your brain into believing you don’t have enough. And start feeling sorry for yourself. Instead of grateful for what you do have.</p>
<p class="p1">So I want less. </p>
<p class="p1">Listen at [6:28]. Turney explains why wanting more destroys you.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>3) Build up your gut.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">We have instincts. And our bodies speak to us. But we’re good at ignoring it. The pain.</p>
<p class="p1">We think stomach aches are just stomach aches. But it’s an accumulation abuse. Stress. Worry. Fear.</p>
<p class="p1">You have to listen to your body. Notice the pain.</p>
<p class="p1">Turney says, “I became successful on the trading desk because I had great instincts, and I used my gut. Along the way I lost that.”</p>
<p class="p1">Listen at [51:50] to hear how he got his gut back.</p>
<p class="p1">After everything, I ask him, “Has it worked out?”</p>
<p class="p1">“I'll tell you this...”</p>
<p class="p1">Listen here for my interview with Turney.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll learn how to choose yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">And you’ll hear how Turney did it himself. How he turned his back on his tribe, his drugs, his money. </p>
<p class="p1">It took him most of his life.</p>
<p class="p1">But he did it. You can too.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t want to be afraid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I am.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ll explain why. But first, I want to introduce you to Adam Grant. </span><span class="s2">He has the solution to my problem…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And maybe your problem, too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Adam is the youngest tenured and highest-ranking professor at the famed business university The Wharton School, a writer for <em>The New York Times</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In researching his new book, </span><span class="s2"><em>Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World</em>,</span><span class="s1"> Adam met with today's most successful and innovative entrepreneurs.</span> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why? To get answers.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“We have a ton of guidance on how to generate ideas,” he says. But what about after? What do you do?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><em>Originals</em> teaches you how to bring new ideas into the world.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And really, there’s no grand theory on how to be "original." But there are tricks… And Adam discovered some patterns among today’s most successful entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He spoke to Google’s co-founder, Larry Page, Warby Parker’s founders and CEOs, and thought leaders like the renowned writer, Malcolm Gladwell.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From Gladwell, Adam learned the most powerful technique to induce creativity. From Larry Page and the Warby Parker guys, he found a common thread. Hint: don’t quit your day job. But, more on that later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">I’m going to tell you t</span><span class="s1">he top three things to be “an original.” They might surprise you. But first, I want you to know what else you’ll get from today’s podcast:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">How to get into a flow state (even during tasks you don’t like) [51:32]<br /> </span></li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Should you plan your procrastination? [25:20]<br /> </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The most powerful techniques to immerse yourself and bring creativity into your life(including Malcolm Gladwell’s library trick) [20:06]<br /> </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Why the hell Adam Grant didn’t invest seed money in Warby Parker and become a billionaire [8:38]<br /> </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">An ode to the idea muscle: why it’s more important to have quantity over quality ideas [28:19]</span> </li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ok so here they are. </span><span class="s2">T</span><span class="s1">he top three things to become "an original:"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><strong>1) Induce creativity</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">First unlearn. Then learn...</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We’ve all internalized things we need to question.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That’s what adults do. We make up rules and reasons. We draw lines instead of pictures… tell “facts,” not stories.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But why can’t we play with our food? Or stand on the counter?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Kids think. Kids create.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And we can get back to that too.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">We just have to unlearn. And then re-learn.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“This comes back to our idea of broadening your experience and your knowledge,” Adam says. “You need to step outside of your field in order to see what you should be challenging.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Immerse yourself in new domains. Go beyond work… beyond your office… beyond the usual.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Personally, I dabble in a lot of things. I play games. I write. I read. I'm involved in lots of businesses. And I recently tried stand-up comedy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">“I've just pursued things I'm curious about,” Adam says, “and then unexpectedly, they turn out to have bridges between them.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">That’s the key to learning. Do something new. Do a dare of the day. It’s good for your creative health.</span> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2) Don’t quit your day job (yet).</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Give yourself time to build your business. It worked for me. I tell why in this episode. Listen at [21:31].</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And be conservative. It’s one of the best ways to be original.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I was stunned actually,” Adam says. He read this a “</span><span class="s2">nationally represented study of American entrepreneurs.” </span><span class="s1">“People who did what you did, James, and kept their day job are 33% less likely to fail.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>3) Propel your ideas forward</strong></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s4">Doubting your ideas can be paralyzing, so eliminate self-doubt. According to Adam, </span><span class="s1">a lot of originals said, “Look, you could fail by starting a business that flops or you could fail by not starting a business at all, and I don't want to be in that second category."  Listen at [22:09] to get actionable steps to fight self-doubt.</span></p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Listen now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And let’s stop being afraid...</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I don’t want to be afraid.</p>
<p class="p1">But I am.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll explain why. But first, I want to introduce you to Adam Grant. He has the solution to my problem…</p>
<p class="p3">And maybe your problem, too.</p>
<p class="p3">Adam is the youngest tenured and highest-ranking professor at the famed business university The Wharton School, a writer for <em>The New York Times</em>, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">In researching his new book, <em>Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World</em>, Adam met with today's most successful and innovative entrepreneurs. </p>
<p class="p1">Why? To get answers.</p>
<p class="p3">“We have a ton of guidance on how to generate ideas,” he says. But what about after? What do you do?</p>
<p class="p3"><em>Originals</em> teaches you how to bring new ideas into the world.</p>
<p class="p3">And really, there’s no grand theory on how to be "original." But there are tricks… And Adam discovered some patterns among today’s most successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="p1">He spoke to Google’s co-founder, Larry Page, Warby Parker’s founders and CEOs, and thought leaders like the renowned writer, Malcolm Gladwell.</p>
<p class="p3">From Gladwell, Adam learned the most powerful technique to induce creativity. From Larry Page and the Warby Parker guys, he found a common thread. Hint: don’t quit your day job. But, more on that later.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you the top three things to be “an original.” They might surprise you. But first, I want you to know what else you’ll get from today’s podcast:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">How to get into a flow state (even during tasks you don’t like) [51:32] </li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Should you plan your procrastination? [25:20] </li>
<li class="li1">The most powerful techniques to immerse yourself and bring creativity into your life(including Malcolm Gladwell’s library trick) [20:06] </li>
<li class="li1">Why the hell Adam Grant didn’t invest seed money in Warby Parker and become a billionaire [8:38] </li>
<li class="li1">An ode to the idea muscle: why it’s more important to have quantity over quality ideas [28:19] </li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Ok so here they are. The top three things to become "an original:"</p>
<p class="p3">1) Induce creativity</p>
<p class="p3">First unlearn. Then learn...</p>
<p class="p3">We’ve all internalized things we need to question.</p>
<p class="p3">That’s what adults do. We make up rules and reasons. We draw lines instead of pictures… tell “facts,” not stories.</p>
<p class="p3">But why can’t we play with our food? Or stand on the counter?</p>
<p class="p3">Kids think. Kids create.</p>
<p class="p3">And we can get back to that too.</p>
<p class="p3">We just have to unlearn. And then re-learn.</p>
<p class="p3">“This comes back to our idea of broadening your experience and your knowledge,” Adam says. “You need to step outside of your field in order to see what you should be challenging.”</p>
<p class="p3">Immerse yourself in new domains. Go beyond work… beyond your office… beyond the usual.</p>
<p class="p3">Personally, I dabble in a lot of things. I play games. I write. I read. I'm involved in lots of businesses. And I recently tried stand-up comedy.</p>
<p class="p3">“I've just pursued things I'm curious about,” Adam says, “and then unexpectedly, they turn out to have bridges between them.”</p>
<p class="p3">That’s the key to learning. Do something new. Do a dare of the day. It’s good for your creative health. </p>
<p class="p1">2) Don’t quit your day job (yet).</p>
<p class="p1">Give yourself time to build your business. It worked for me. I tell why in this episode. Listen at [21:31].</p>
<p class="p1">And be conservative. It’s one of the best ways to be original.</p>
<p class="p1">“I was stunned actually,” Adam says. He read this a “nationally represented study of American entrepreneurs.” “People who did what you did, James, and kept their day job are 33% less likely to fail.”</p>
<p class="p1">3) Propel your ideas forward</p>
<p class="p3">Doubting your ideas can be paralyzing, so eliminate self-doubt. According to Adam, a lot of originals said, “Look, you could fail by starting a business that flops or you could fail by not starting a business at all, and I don't want to be in that second category."  Listen at [22:09] to get actionable steps to fight self-doubt.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Listen now.</p>
<p class="p1">And let’s stop being afraid...</p>
<p class="p1">Together.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Ask the world this question, and you’ll drown in failure.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll lose. Anything you take, anything you earn, will be foul.</p>
<p class="p1">I bet you’ve asked this question before. Maybe everyday. Maybe all your life.</p>
<p class="p1">“How can I get?”</p>
<p class="p1">How can I get rich? How can I get happy?</p>
<p class="p1">How can I get more?</p>
<p class="p1">There’s no return on getting.</p>
<p class="p1">It leave you with nothing. Or worse than nothingness. Emptiness.</p>
<p class="p1">But there’s another way. It’s simple. And it works for me</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to earn your worth. It works for me.</p>
<p class="p1">And it works for my podcast guest, Russell Simmons, “the third richest figure in hip-hop with an estimated net worth of $340 million.”</p>
<p class="p1">He gets.</p>
<p class="p1">He told me a story. “That was my first realization that hard work turned into something,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">“I had never been on a plane. I had certainly never been out of the country, and landing in Amsterdam they're like, ‘Mr. Simmons what would you like?’</p>
<p class="p1">I'm like, ‘Oh shit Mr. Simmons.’</p>
<p class="p1">That was a revelation. I was a grown man I could get things I wanted.”</p>
<p class="p1">But not all his life.</p>
<p class="p1">He grew up in Queens. “Hollis, Queens and 205 Street. Frank Lucas was on our corner and so that was the heroin capital. The neighborhood went down very quickly,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">"Obviously every kid took a lot of drugs.” He was 13. Joined a gang. Sold drugs, “had some experiences,” and escaped.</p>
<p class="p1">Now he’s the chairman and CEO of Rush Communications and the co-founder of Def Jam, the record label famous for spotting Beastie Boys, Jay Z, Kanye West, Rihanna and 100 others.</p>
<p class="p1">Since 1984.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to know how he got here. And how he became one of my heroes.</p>
<p class="p1">“I didn't discover hip-hop,” he says, “hip-hop discovered me.”</p>
<p class="p1">Opportunity found him. He was at the center of that universe.</p>
<p class="p1">He grew his opportunities. He spotted talent, formed partnerships, and became an entrepreneur. </p>
<p class="p1">He learned a lot. You might expect to hear “he hustled.” But mostly, he gave back.</p>
<p class="p1">“This idea that you have to trade with the world or manipulate the world to be successful is wrong headed,” Russell says.</p>
<p class="p1">Contribute. “If you look at your own history of success it's because you contributed to success,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s works for me too.</p>
<p class="p1">I give writing. I get readers.</p>
<p class="p1">I give interviews. I get advice, entertainment, a network, new friends, a memory, and experiences I would never get if I didn’t give.</p>
<p class="p1">And giving can be simple.</p>
<p class="p1">Write emails to people you admire. Surprise someone. Do something that makes someone else’s life better. Give ideas. Say thanks.</p>
<p class="p1">“You have to be comfortable in your seat, and life's only goal is to be happy and comfortable in your seat,” Russell says. “From that space the universe unravels and it attracts everything. You become a greater giver because you're focused on giving and you're not fearful of the world. You become a contributor.”</p>
<p class="p1">“Anyway I'm out of cocaine now. Just so you know I've been vegan and I've stopped taking drugs almost thirty years ago,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s why I got to have him on my podcast.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">He wrote a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1592409326/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s2"><em>The Happy Vegan: A Guide to Living a Long, Healthy, and Successful Life</em></span></a>. I got to go to his apartment to interview him.</span></p>
<p class="p1">It’s an incredible book. I learned a huge amount reading it. I'm not a vegan. But I'm strongly considering it.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to today's podcast. You’ll get you ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">Ideas about how to change different industries (food, farming, the drug industry). And you can start giving.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll learn how to contribute. Give. And why it’s important to your success.</p>
<p class="p1">“Good givers are great getters,” Russell says.</p>
<p class="p1">This interview will get you thinking. </p>
<p class="p1">You’re going to learn how to “get.” I’ll give you the starting step. Stop asking, “What can I get?” And start asking, “What can I give?” Listen now.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I don’t diet.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a distraction.</p>
<p class="p1">My rule is simple. Don’t eat when you’re not hungry.</p>
<p class="p1">But that’s not always easy. Nothing is always easy.</p>
<p class="p1">With diet, you have an internal argument.</p>
<p class="p1">Willpower versus cravings.</p>
<p class="p1">So what do you do when the voice in your head won’t stop?</p>
<p class="p1">You struggle. Your mind plays ping pong.</p>
<p class="p1">Eat it. Don’t it. One bite. No. Yes. Ok. Damn it.</p>
<p class="p1">Only one side wins. Willpower or cravings.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to make willpower win. How to make that voice go away.</p>
<p class="p1">And this will do a lot more for you than just help you lose weight.</p>
<p class="p1">It will give you better brain function. Make you pay attention better. Give you more energy. You’ll feel better.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll tell you my secret. But before I do, I want to introduce you to a Silicon Valley investor and tech entrepreneur, Dave Asprey, who spent two decades and more than $300,000 hacking biology.</p>
<p class="p1">When hunger stops interrupting you, “then you have more capacity to make better decisions somewhere else in your life,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">He hacked hunger.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">And now he’s sharing his solution in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1623366038/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s2"><em>Bulletproof: The Cookbook: Lose Up to a Pound a Day, Increase Your Energy, and End Food Cravings for Good</em></span></a><em>. </em>Which I’m giving away for free <a href="http://bit.ly/1mUYak4%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s2">here</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1">It works like this. But don’t quote me.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m not a doctor. Except I do play one on Twitter.</p>
<p class="p1">When your body burns fat or sugar, you get energy. But “We’re wired to only burn fat or only burn sugar,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">One or the other.</p>
<p class="p1">If your body could burn both at the same time, you’d get double the energy. Or triple.</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t know exactly how much. But I felt like Superman. I wrote an entire book in one weekend.</p>
<p class="p1">And Superman felt like Superman, too. Brandon Routh, the guy who played Superman in 2006 wrote the foreword to Dave’s book.</p>
<p class="p1">Because it works. But we’re all different. What works for me might not work for you.</p>
<p class="p1">For me, the distraction is gone. The voice that says, “I’m hungry,” stops. So you don’t overeat.</p>
<p class="p1">Your satisfied. And focused.</p>
<p class="p1">“One of the three big urges that interrupt you all the time stops interrupting you,” Dave says, “and then you have more capacity to make better decisions somewhere else in your life.”</p>
<p class="p1">You have more energy to do what you love. To read, write 10 ideas, start a business on the side.</p>
<p class="p1">“I would happily weight 20 lbs more if I got better brain function, if I could pay attention better if I had more energy, if I felt better, but it turns out that when you eat to get enough energy into the body, you just effortlessly lose weight without willpower,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">Get your brain back, your willpower and insane amounts of energy. Be like superman. Listen now.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I don’t diet.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a distraction.</p>
<p class="p1">My rule is simple. Don’t eat when you’re not hungry.</p>
<p class="p1">But that’s not always easy. Nothing is always easy.</p>
<p class="p1">With diet, you have an internal argument.</p>
<p class="p1">Willpower versus cravings.</p>
<p class="p1">So what do you do when the voice in your head won’t stop?</p>
<p class="p1">You struggle. Your mind plays ping pong.</p>
<p class="p1">Eat it. Don’t it. One bite. No. Yes. Ok. Damn it.</p>
<p class="p1">Only one side wins. Willpower or cravings.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to make willpower win. How to make that voice go away.</p>
<p class="p1">And this will do a lot more for you than just help you lose weight.</p>
<p class="p1">It will give you better brain function. Make you pay attention better. Give you more energy. You’ll feel better.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll tell you my secret. But before I do, I want to introduce you to a Silicon Valley investor and tech entrepreneur, Dave Asprey, who spent two decades and more than $300,000 hacking biology.</p>
<p class="p1">When hunger stops interrupting you, “then you have more capacity to make better decisions somewhere else in your life,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">He hacked hunger.</p>
<p class="p3">And now he’s sharing his solution in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1623366038/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><em>Bulletproof: The Cookbook: Lose Up to a Pound a Day, Increase Your Energy, and End Food Cravings for Good</em></a><em>. </em>Which I’m giving away for free <a href="http://bit.ly/1mUYak4%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">here</a></p>
<p class="p1">It works like this. But don’t quote me.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m not a doctor. Except I do play one on Twitter.</p>
<p class="p1">When your body burns fat or sugar, you get energy. But “We’re wired to only burn fat or only burn sugar,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">One or the other.</p>
<p class="p1">If your body could burn both at the same time, you’d get double the energy. Or triple.</p>
<p class="p1">I don’t know exactly how much. But I felt like Superman. I wrote an entire book in one weekend.</p>
<p class="p1">And Superman felt like Superman, too. Brandon Routh, the guy who played Superman in 2006 wrote the foreword to Dave’s book.</p>
<p class="p1">Because it works. But we’re all different. What works for me might not work for you.</p>
<p class="p1">For me, the distraction is gone. The voice that says, “I’m hungry,” stops. So you don’t overeat.</p>
<p class="p1">Your satisfied. And focused.</p>
<p class="p1">“One of the three big urges that interrupt you all the time stops interrupting you,” Dave says, “and then you have more capacity to make better decisions somewhere else in your life.”</p>
<p class="p1">You have more energy to do what you love. To read, write 10 ideas, start a business on the side.</p>
<p class="p1">“I would happily weight 20 lbs more if I got better brain function, if I could pay attention better if I had more energy, if I felt better, but it turns out that when you eat to get enough energy into the body, you just effortlessly lose weight without willpower,” Dave says.</p>
<p class="p1">Get your brain back, your willpower and insane amounts of energy. Be like superman. Listen now.</p>

<p class="p2">He covered stories in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Israel, the West Bank<span class="s1">,</span> and Gaza. He went to Iraq six or seven times.</p>
<p class="p2">When he got back, he was depressed. He was 32 years old and had never touched hard drugs before.</p>
<p class="p4">But it became the thing that made him feel better.</p>
<p class="p1">Millions of people were watching. The red light was on. And right there, in the middle of his live segment, he had a panic attack.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you how to deal with stress. I’ll tell you what works for me. But first, I want to tell you about my guest, Dan Harris.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Dan is an anchor on "Good Morning America" and "Nightline."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He's also the No. 1 <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of </span><em>10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works</em> <span class="s3">– </span><em>A True Story</em>.</p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s4"><strong>After the book came out people had questions. So </strong></span><span class="s5">he also </span>created an app called "10% Happier." It teaches users easy “judo moves” to have more creativity, feel less stress, and be happier. </p>
<p class="p8">It helps you surrender. Be self-aware. Focused.</p>
<p class="p2">“The events that led up to my panic attack were a case study in mindlessness,” Dan says. “Going to wars without thinking about the consequences, getting depressed and not knowing it and blindly self<span class="s1">-</span>medicating.”</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to know what pushed him over the edge.</p>
<p class="p2">“The one<span class="s1">-</span>word answer is cocaine,” Dan says. “The more complicated answer is I arrived at ABC News when I was 28.”</p>
<p class="p2">He was insecure. He worked with big names like Diane Sawyer and Barbara Walters. He wanted to be successful.</p>
<p class="p2">“My Jewish father has this expression, ‘The price of security is insecurity.’ I really embraced that,” he says.</p>
<p class="p2">The pressure never let up. He demanded more of himself.</p>
<p class="p4">But why do we make it so hard for ourselves?</p>
<p class="p1">Many people have gone through this slow<span class="s1">-</span>motion panic attack. Including me. It's the stress of daily living. </p>
<p class="p1">Something bad happens to you. You lose a job or get a divorce. Everyday wear and tear picks at you.</p>
<p class="p4">Stress happens over time. And if you don’t notice it, it builds.</p>
<p class="p4">The voice in your head becomes meaner. Angrier. More resentful and regretful. Energy is wasted. Your creativity dies. Your idea muscle atrophies. And you’re at the bottom of the funnel dreaming about retirement.</p>
<p class="p4">But instead of imagining a better life later, retire. You can retire a little bit every day.</p>
<p class="p4">Breathe. Feel your chest fall. That’s retirement.</p>
<p class="p4">It’s a fantasy. I’m going to tell you how to make it real right now.</p>
<p class="p4">But before I do, let me tell you what you’ll get from today’s podcast:</p>
<p class="p9">a) Learn How to Have More Ideas</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dan says, "When you ask, </span>'What is boredom like? What does this feel like? Where am I feeling it in my body? What's the taste of it in my mind?’ That is curiosity.” Curiosity produces creativity. And ideas. You’ll learn how to make room for curiosity.</p>
<p class="p9">b) Distance Yourself From Stress</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Dan teaches you how to notice stress and see your problems clearly. You’ll learn to separate yourself from it. And relax. </span>Essentially, you're becoming a scientist of your own inner reactions. A scientist is not his experiment. The same way humans are not their reactions and emotions to things. Those are separate. You’ll learn how to separate yourself from stress.c) Be 10% Happier</p>
<p class="p1">“First of all, 10% is just a joke. You can't quantify happiness,” Dan says. “I came up with that as a bullshit answer to a friend.” But being a little bit happier is better than being a little bit miserable. But you have to practice. You're practicing becoming aware of the angry voice that comes up and reacts. So you can be calm<span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Ok<span class="s1">,</span> now here’s Dan’s secret to dealing with stress: meditation</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">“</span>Let me just say outright, because as soon as you bring that word up, some high percentage of your listeners are like, ‘All right, I'm done with this podcast. Meditation's bullshit. I don't want to do it,'" Dan says.</p>
<p class="p4">He thought that too.</p>
<p class="p1">“The book is really the story of me coming to terms with the fact that meditation is not what I thought it was. It's secular and scientifically validated,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">People reject meditation. It’s a reflex. But there are a lot of benefits to it. It:</p>
<p class="p1">- Lowers blood pressure</p>
<p class="p1">- Boosts immune system</p>
<p class="p1">- Rewires parts of your brain</p>
<p class="p1">“Nobody continues to meditate because they feel like 'my pre-frontal cortex might be changing.' You continue to meditate because you're less of an asshole to yourself and others,” he says. “That's a huge value added.” And I agree.</p>
<p class="p1">Louis C<span class="s1">.</span>K<span class="s1">.</span>, my favorite comedian, says, “It’s not up to you if you’re an asshole or not. That’s up to everybody else.” But you can be aware of it.</p>
<p class="p1">Louis says, “Self love is a good thing, but self-awareness is more important. You need to once in a while go ‘Um<span class="s1">,</span> I'm kind of an asshole.’ You have to have that thought once in a while or you’re a psychopath.”</p>
<p class="p4">Listen to this podcast with Dan Harris. You’ll learn how to relax, distance yourself from stress, turn boredom into curiosity and become some percent happier.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 150 - Daymond John: Do This When Success is Your Only Option </title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">"I remember it like it was yesterday. It was Good Friday, 1989, at 3:30 in the afternoon. It was 37 degrees outside. I stood outside the Colosseum Mall, a mall in Jamaica, Queens. It's pretty popular. Just shivering with a bag of hats. I sold $800 worth of hats in an hour,” Daymond John tells me.</p>
<p class="p1">$800 an hour. That’s “the power of broke.”</p>
<p class="p1">Before FUBU (a $6 billion global apparel company), before Shark Tank, and before Obama chose him as the Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship, Daymond John worked 18-hour days driving a delivery van. And he wasn't making money.</p>
<p class="p1">His paychecks covered overhead – the cost of his van, gas, and maintenance. He worked to make money, and he made money to work. “When I took that to FUBU, I started saying, ‘If we're not making money, it's not worth doing anything,’” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">It's not failure. It's experience.</p>
<p class="p1">"Other people call it failure. I won't call it failure. It's part of the process,” he says. You need to take every single "failure" and bring it forward.</p>
<p class="p1">You're on the floor. And broke.</p>
<p class="p1">Learn from it.</p>
<p class="p1">Money is the byproduct of energy, effort, and strategy.</p>
<p class="p1">"Before you have any business, you're supposed to take inventory of yourself," Daymond says. "Assets and liabilities can be time, energy, education, friends, location, way of thinking."</p>
<p class="p1">You have to take inventory of yourself.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">His new book<em>, </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1101903597/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><span class="s2"><em>The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget, and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage</em></span></a><em> </em>is not Daymond's story. It's your story. And mine.</span></p>
<p class="p1">It's about how you're going to get up, get experience, and get money. These are stories I learned from.</p>
<p class="p1">The power of broke is “the common thread between all of us,” Daymond says. It’s about how you can learn from your mistakes and profit off your potential. Take advantage of that.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to my interview with Daymond.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the <strong>top 3 things you can only learn by listening</strong> to today's podcast:</p>
<p class="p1">- “That is the most important thing about running a business,” Daymond says. “If you don't have that, I don't care how much money you have. You can't buy your way into it.” (at 5:35)</p>
<p class="p1">- I ask Daymond: What are the first steps? What if you’re listening and saying, "I got born at the wrong time," or "I'm in the wrong town”? What if you're hungry? And you want to hustle, and you've got the power of broke, but you don't know what to do with it? (at 21:59)</p>
<p class="p1">- How do you know when a business will be successful? Because it sounds too romantic – the power of broke. Find out how to leverage your resources for success. (at 32:51)</p>

<p class="p2">His new book<em>, </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1101903597/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><em>The Power of Broke: How Empty Pockets, a Tight Budget, and a Hunger for Success Can Become Your Greatest Competitive Advantage</em></a><em> </em>is not Daymond's story. It's your story. And mine.</p>
<p class="p1">It's about how you're going to get up, get experience, and get money. These are stories I learned from.</p>
<p class="p1">The power of broke is “the common thread between all of us,” Daymond says. It’s about how you can learn from your mistakes and profit off your potential. Take advantage of that.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to my interview with Daymond.</p>
<p class="p1">Here are the top 3 things you can only learn by listening to today's podcast:</p>
<p class="p1">- “That is the most important thing about running a business,” Daymond says. “If you don't have that, I don't care how much money you have. You can't buy your way into it.” (at 5:35)</p>
<p class="p1">- I ask Daymond: What are the first steps? What if you’re listening and saying, "I got born at the wrong time," or "I'm in the wrong town”? What if you're hungry? And you want to hustle, and you've got the power of broke, but you don't know what to do with it? (at 21:59)</p>
<p class="p1">- How do you know when a business will be successful? Because it sounds too romantic – the power of broke. Find out how to leverage your resources for success. (at 32:51)</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I was always good at making money.</p>
<p class="p1">I was also good at losing it instantly. I always went broke… Now I know why.</p>
<p class="p1">What was I was doing wrong? I’ll tell you. Because I bet you’re making the same mistake.</p>
<p class="p1">But first, I’ll tell you how to make money. More money than you thought was possible.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to this episode. You’ll hear tested and proven strategies to get rich from Ramit Sethi, the NewYork Times bestselling author and founder of iwillteachyoutoberich.com.</p>
<p class="p1">He grew his business from a dorm-room blog into a multi-million dollar online business.</p>
<p class="p1">And now he started a new company, GrowthLab, to teach you how to do the same thing—start and grow an online business.</p>
<p class="p1">Ramit is a trainer. He’ll make you hustle.</p>
<p class="p1">“It’s like looking up at a skyscraper and saying ‘How am I going to build one of those?’ Well you’re not. You’re going to start by walking in the lobby,” Ramit says, “That’s what you’re going to do on day one.”</p>
<p class="p1">You can’t get rich without putting in the work.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve set goals. None of them came true. But five or six other amazing things that I never could have predicted happened instead.</p>
<p class="p1">Goals require plans.</p>
<p class="p1">You’re going to get rich. How?</p>
<p class="p1">You want to lose weight or start a business. How?</p>
<p class="p1">Ramit will tell you. He’ll turn your goals into achievements.</p>
<p class="p1">Actually, you'll do it, with his help.</p>
<p class="p1">Consider taking his courses… One teaches you how to triple your salary. Which is like heroin. According to one of my other podcast guests, Nassim Taleb.</p>
<p class="p1">Taleb said the three deadliest addictions are 1) heroin, I don’t remember the second one, and 3) a steady salary. How can you feel motivated when you’re prostituting yourself everyday?</p>
<p class="p1">What did I learn from Ramit? It’s less about what I learned, and more about what I feel capable of doing every time I listen to him.</p>
<p class="p1">Fear is a debilitating idea. Replace fear with motivation. You'll be amazed at the results.</p>
<p class="p1">I need motivation to eat well, write everyday, do the <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/02/how-to-be-th"><span class="s1">daily practice</span></a>. And I start over everyday. Because motivation isn’t as constant as your to-do list.</p>
<p class="p1">But with Ramit’s plan, you'll get systems in place. Systems that manage your money and organize your time, and take care of all the things draining you dry.</p>
<p class="p1">"If you’re going to put in work, why not be positive, try to improve yourself, improve your relationship, make more money," Ramit says.</p>
<p class="p1">I haven’t taken his courses. But strangers email me saying they’re great. That they’ve tripled their income. I don’t know why they tell me that. I get a lot of strange emails from strangers. Skip to 40:12 on my podcast. You’ll laugh. Trust me.</p>
<p class="p1">You shouldn’t go a day without laughing anyway.</p>
<p class="p1">I’m going to tell you why I went broke. You’ll hear it in this episode. And you’ll learn how to clean up your life.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll get systems... you’ll get a plan.</p>
<p class="p1">And, thanks to Ramit, you’ll learn how to be rich.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For billionaires, every exchange has a winner and a loser.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s what producers David Levien and Brian Koppelman tell me. They've made some of my favorite movies: <em>Rounders, Ocean’s Thirteen, Solitary Man. </em>Now, they’re coming out with 2016’s most talked about show: <em>Billions </em>on Showtime.</p>
<p class="p1">You can learn a lot from them. David and Brian are producers, creators and risk takers.</p>
<p class="p1">If you want to create, listen to today’s episode.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll see how important it is to <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/10/hardcore-career-advice-for-a-13-year-old/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">follow your curiosity</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s what David and Brian did. Sometimes starting something is that simple.</p>
<p class="p1">Since they were kids, David and Brian were fascinated by two things: power and wealth. They wondered, “What makes a billionaire unique?”</p>
<p class="p1">They had a question, an idea, and conviction. “We were all the f*ck in,” Brian says.</p>
<p class="p1">They had dinner with a bunch of billionaires. It sounds like it would be a lot of fun, but it wasn't. David and Brian were manipulated, belittled, and snubbed. But they were mesmerized.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll give you one story. It’s to tempt you to download this episode. Because I really think you’re going to get a lot out of the interview. You’ll hear their stories - the behind-the-scenes of 2016’s most talked about show.</p>
<p class="p1">You’ll get motivation to write, build, and be creative. You’ll hear about how a partnership is born.</p>
<p class="p1">And you’ll learn why people knowingly make the wrong choices.</p>
<p class="p1">And maybe, you'll make the right ones. Whatever those are... the right choices for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Ok so one story before you press play:</p>
<p class="p1">Over dinner, David and Brian met with their first billionaire. It cost more than $2,000.</p>
<p class="p1">He racked up the price and made them suffer.</p>
<p class="p1">“There was clearly a power dynamic,” David says.</p>
<p class="p1">He acted like he wasn’t thinking, but “billionaires don't just accidentally stumble along and amass great fortunes,” David says, "He was showing us that he was no sucker. And we were.”</p>
<p class="p1">Before that night, "I've never thought, ‘Who's gonna win the dinner?’” Brian said.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6u5BKzf-5g%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">watched the trailer</span></a>, you know what this guy did – “What’s the point of having f*ck you money if you never say f*ck you.”</p>
<p class="p1">And they felt it.</p>
<p class="p1">Morally, David and Brian believe in loyalty, honor, and ambition. And that you can balance these things. But not everyone does.</p>
<p class="p1">Some people believe nice guys finish last.</p>
<p class="p1">This interview reveals how to get inside the mind of billionaires. It might make you sick. Or it might make you hungry.</p>

<p class="p1">Before that night, "I've never thought, ‘Who's gonna win the dinner?’” Brian said.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6u5BKzf-5g%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">watched the trailer</a>, you know what this guy did – “What’s the point of having f*ck you money if you never say f*ck you.”</p>
<p class="p1">And they felt it.</p>
<p class="p1">Morally, David and Brian believe in loyalty, honor, and ambition. And that you can balance these things. But not everyone does.</p>
<p class="p1">Some people believe nice guys finish last.</p>
<p class="p1">This interview reveals how to get inside the mind of billionaires. It might make you sick. Or it might make you hungry.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You can’t make everyone happy. Really, you can’t make anyone happy.</p>
<p class="p1">The sooner you accept this, the sooner you can let go of control, shame, or whatever your parents did to you, and start having sex. Or happiness. Whatever you're searching for.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll explain.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest today, a seven-time <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author, Neil Strauss, has written books on Motley Crue, Marilyn Manson, and pornstar Jenna Jameson, before exploring the pickup artist scene.</p>
<p class="p1">Sex was all around him.</p>
<p class="p1">He was immersed in the seduction community, but Neil couldn't find love himself. No woman would kiss him. He grew up a loser, and couldn’t get a girlfriend for most of his life.</p>
<p class="p1">Now he’s happily married. But between marriage and being a loser, he had a lot of “pleasure fantasy experiences.” Meaning, he learned how to pick up women and started having crazy sex orgies. One after another.</p>
<p class="p1">And then he just stopped, and the sex parties ended.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to know why. What made him decide he couldn’t handle it anymore? But I’ll get back to this.</p>
<p class="p1">In his first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060554738/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists</em></span></a>, Neil gives you easy tools you can use to have confidence. He teaches you how to feel like you're in control of a social situation.</p>
<p class="p1">Neil was so busy having sex, he didn’t have time to get back to his normal life.</p>
<p class="p1">Personally, I don’t think I’d like that. I would just constantly be jealous or insecure, to be honest.</p>
<p class="p1">But back to happiness. Which I don’t even like to talk about really… We put too much pressure on ourselves to be happy. You can’t be happy all the time. And when you are happy, it should be special.</p>
<p class="p1">But Neil had a good friend to help him refocus. “You need someone in your life who can reflect yourself back to you so you can see yourself a little bit,” he says.</p>
<p class="p1">His producer and close friend, Rick Rubin, said, “Look, you got everything you wanted in <em>The Game</em>. Why are you still not happy?”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when Neil started looking for the truth.</p>
<p class="p1">In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060898763/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>The Truth: An Uncomfortable Book About Relationships</em></span></a>, Neil shows you how he gave up control. The book is about beliefs. ”It’s so hard to recognize your beliefs, let alone change them, because you’re living with yourself.”</p>
<p class="p1">But behaviors are easier to change. That’s what he teaches you in this episode. You’ll learn how to feel healthier emotionally.</p>
<p class="p1">When your personal life is together, you’re much more capable of achieving bigger things, accumulating wealth, and feeling less stressed and worried.</p>
<p class="p1">Neil says, “There’s always a reason for what you’re doing, and if you don’t know the reason, then maybe you’re living an unconscious life.”</p>
<p class="p1">And if you’re just curious about the sex, then there’s something here for you, too.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 146 - Gabriel Weinberg: 19 Ways to Sell Your Ideas and Scale</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You know why I wrote Choose Yourself. But you don’t know how you got here. How did you get here, on my email list, my website, Facebook page, Twitter? Do you want to know why you're following me? I’m going to tell you.</p>
<p class="p1">I’ll tell you my secrets to building an email list, a customer base, an audience. I’m going to tell you how I got you here.</p>
<p class="p1">There are specific tactics I use. And you can use them, too, for your business or blog or anything. But I’ll get back to that.</p>
<p class="p1">First you need an idea. And there needs to be a demand for that idea.</p>
<p class="p1">Next, you should be wondering, “Is my idea any good?” Probably not. Or maybe it is. You could be much smarter than me. Most of my ideas don’t lead to anything. But a few have. Like StockPickr, the company I built and sold for millions before almost destroying myself and <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/08/i-want-to-die/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">wanting to die</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">If you’re an idea machine, you already know how to come up with ideas. Scaling an idea is more challenging. Results don’t just appear. You need traction. You need to grow and acquire new customers.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest today, Gabriel Weinberg, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1591848369/?tag=jame"><span class="s1"><em>Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth</em></span></a> and CEO of Duck Duck Go, is the king of results -- search results that is.</p>
<p class="p1">That's what Duck, Duck, Go does. It is a search engine and it's stealing millions of customers from Google. It takes some sort of voodoo mastermind to figure out how to beat Google at their own game. Gabriel challenges the status quo. He’s part of that rare breed of people who believe nothing is impossible.</p>
<p class="p1">Now DuckDuckGo is pretty huge. But why would anyone want to challenge Google? That’s what I wanted to find out. And I’ll tell you why in a second.</p>
<p class="p1">But let’s get back to my secret. In 33 minutes and 22 seconds, you can know my preferred method to scaling your business. Or you can just skip to the 33:22 mark in today’s interview. You might be surprised to find out how I scaled Choose Yourself — how I got traction.</p>
<p class="p1">But if you're not looking for shortcuts, listen to the whole interview. You'll get an all-inclusive, complete breakdown on how to sell and scale your best ideas.</p>
<p class="p1">Gabriel goes over every marketing tactic, nineteen to be exact. If you're resourceful, you can use them to start building your wealth for the New Year.</p>
<p class="p1">And in his book, Gabriel and Justin Mares give you marketing tips from the masters, including Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, Kayak founder Paul English, and more than a dozen others.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today to hear Gabriel break down the best tactics for every stage of your business. You’ll also hear why he wasn’t happy with Google, and how he started today’s superior search engine, in addition to how you and thousands of other people got here. And how you can start selling and scaling. Ready, set… (duck, duck) go.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 145 - Mick Ebeling: I'll Teach You How to Do Impossible Things</title>
			<pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2015 22:28:25 +0000</pubDate>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I know a miracle worker. He’s an entrepreneur, marketing man, and film producer who gets companies like HP to say, “yes” to him.</p>
<p class="p2">You can learn a lot from him. I did.</p>
<p class="p2">One thing I learned is there’s more to choosing yourself. There’s a part two.</p>
<p class="p2">Part one is when you see things in your life that are absurd, decide you’re not going to stand for it anymore and quit. You decide to become physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually healthy. That’s choosing yourself.</p>
<p class="p2">Part two is when you see what’s wrong with the world and say, “That’s absurd. Let’s change that. Let’s hack that. Let’s modify that so it’s affordable." That's what Mick Ebeling does-- founder of the Not Impossible Labs and the Not Impossible Foundation. Through these two entities, Mick figured out how build whatever he wants, and solve impossible problems.</p>
<p class="p2">Mick sees the world through his own lens. It’s the reason he’s successful.</p>
<p class="p2">He creates technology that solves absurd problems like having your arms blown off. No prosthetics, no solution. Or being paralyzed and unable to speak to your family ever again.</p>
<p class="p2">The technology to fix these problems does exist. But when you can’t afford it, you have an even bigger problem.</p>
<p class="p2">This is why Mick hacks. He disrupts the system, doesn’t wait for permission, and believes in impossible things. You can, too, but more on that later.</p>
<p class="p2">Let me tell you how he got started. Mick was just reading the paper. He read that thousands of people in the country of Sudan don’t have arms because of war injuries. And they just live with it. They can’t afford prosthetics, so they hand-feed each other, dress each other, and help each other with all the other daily necessities.</p>
<p class="p2">Mick decided to do something. He flew to Sudan with no plan and figured out how to create prosthetic arms using a 3D printer. This is someone with no experience in medicine or engineering. He’s just a guy with a big heart who decided nothing is impossible.</p>
<p class="p2">On the show, you’ll hear how he 3D printed arms for a boy named Daniel, and empowered an entire country to do this for thousands of other people missing limbs.</p>
<p class="p2">I wanted to know how it's done. How can people quit their jobs and do things that really matter? Mick tells you how on the podcast.</p>
<p class="p2">You’ll also learn how to think like today’s most successful innovators. “We’re not trying to create the next $700 pill,” Mick says, “We’re trying to create something that totally disrupts a particular fill-in-the-blank, maybe it’s a way of communication, a way of transportation.” This is the winning mentality today: Uber, Airbnb, Not Impossible Labs.</p>
<p class="p2">By making technology accessible, he’s solving global problems. “Help one, help many,” that’s Not Impossible Labs’ mission.</p>
<p class="p2">Then Mick’s team tells the story through videos that go viral and infect everyone with this bug- the not impossible bug.</p>
<p class="p2">Besides a miracle worker, Mick’s a story teller. “Each of our projects tells the story of a single individual. By helping one person, how many others can we help?”</p>
<p class="p2">Stories bridge the gap between helping just one person and helping many. Mick’s not just choosing himself… He’s choosing the world.</p>
<p class="p2">“Once you start to have the awareness of something you need, you start to see it.”</p>
<p class="p2">So how can you get the big idea, do the impossible, and become beautifully successful</p>
<p class="p2">“First of all, you can just start to believe in this mentality that nothing is impossible,” Mick says.</p>
<p class="p2">Try it.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, look for absurdities. They’re everywhere – when you read or watch TV. When something bothers you, think of solutions. Be an idea machine.</p>
<p class="p2">Third, disrupt. Don’t wait for big government or big business to give you permission. Forget bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="p2">Disruption starts now. We’re hacking the system.</p>
<p class="p2">Listen to today’s episode. You’ll hear Mick’s miracle stories, find out where he gets his big ideas and his money, and how you too can do impossible things.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">I know a miracle worker. He’s an entrepreneur, marketing man, and film producer who gets companies like HP to say, “yes” to him.</p>
<p class="p2">You can learn a lot from him. I did.</p>
<p class="p2">One thing I learned is there’s more to choosing yourself. There’s a part two.</p>
<p class="p2">Part one is when you see things in your life that are absurd, decide you’re not going to stand for it anymore and quit. You decide to become physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually healthy. That’s choosing yourself.</p>
<p class="p2">Part two is when you see what’s wrong with the world and say, “That’s absurd. Let’s change that. Let’s hack that. Let’s modify that so it’s affordable." That's what Mick Ebeling does-- founder of the Not Impossible Labs and the Not Impossible Foundation. Through these two entities, Mick figured out how build whatever he wants, and solve impossible problems.</p>
<p class="p2">Mick sees the world through his own lens. It’s the reason he’s successful.</p>
<p class="p2">He creates technology that solves absurd problems like having your arms blown off. No prosthetics, no solution. Or being paralyzed and unable to speak to your family ever again.</p>
<p class="p2">The technology to fix these problems does exist. But when you can’t afford it, you have an even bigger problem.</p>
<p class="p2">This is why Mick hacks. He disrupts the system, doesn’t wait for permission, and believes in impossible things. You can, too, but more on that later.</p>
<p class="p2">Let me tell you how he got started. Mick was just reading the paper. He read that thousands of people in the country of Sudan don’t have arms because of war injuries. And they just live with it. They can’t afford prosthetics, so they hand-feed each other, dress each other, and help each other with all the other daily necessities.</p>
<p class="p2">Mick decided to do something. He flew to Sudan with no plan and figured out how to create prosthetic arms using a 3D printer. This is someone with no experience in medicine or engineering. He’s just a guy with a big heart who decided nothing is impossible.</p>
<p class="p2">On the show, you’ll hear how he 3D printed arms for a boy named Daniel, and empowered an entire country to do this for thousands of other people missing limbs.</p>
<p class="p2">I wanted to know how it's done. How can people quit their jobs and do things that really matter? Mick tells you how on the podcast.</p>
<p class="p2">You’ll also learn how to think like today’s most successful innovators. “We’re not trying to create the next $700 pill,” Mick says, “We’re trying to create something that totally disrupts a particular fill-in-the-blank, maybe it’s a way of communication, a way of transportation.” This is the winning mentality today: Uber, Airbnb, Not Impossible Labs.</p>
<p class="p2">By making technology accessible, he’s solving global problems. “Help one, help many,” that’s Not Impossible Labs’ mission.</p>
<p class="p2">Then Mick’s team tells the story through videos that go viral and infect everyone with this bug- the not impossible bug.</p>
<p class="p2">Besides a miracle worker, Mick’s a story teller. “Each of our projects tells the story of a single individual. By helping one person, how many others can we help?”</p>
<p class="p2">Stories bridge the gap between helping just one person and helping many. Mick’s not just choosing himself… He’s choosing the world.</p>
<p class="p2">“Once you start to have the awareness of something you need, you start to see it.”</p>
<p class="p2">So how can you get the big idea, do the impossible, and become beautifully successful</p>
<p class="p2">“First of all, you can just start to believe in this mentality that nothing is impossible,” Mick says.</p>
<p class="p2">Try it.</p>
<p class="p2">Second, look for absurdities. They’re everywhere – when you read or watch TV. When something bothers you, think of solutions. Be an idea machine.</p>
<p class="p2">Third, disrupt. Don’t wait for big government or big business to give you permission. Forget bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="p2">Disruption starts now. We’re hacking the system.</p>
<p class="p2">Listen to today’s episode. You’ll hear Mick’s miracle stories, find out where he gets his big ideas and his money, and how you too can do impossible things.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You can have power, but it comes with a lot of bullshit. When Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben said, “With great power comes great responsibility,” he was trying to say that power comes with a lot of BS.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a good warning. We want all of the power and none of the bullshit. And then you hear everyone complaining.</p>
<p class="p1">It’s hard to be a good guy.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest today, Jane Swift, is the youngest female governor in U.S. history turned CEO of Middlebury Interactive Languages. She’s a superhero. During her campaign, she was pregnant with twins. She also already had a daughter.</p>
<p class="p1">But that didn’t stop her. She gives and expects nothing in return. That’s what I do.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about your obstacles. Now imagine doing more and complaining less.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, you might feel like you either have energy and no resources, or resources and no energy. Jane created both. And in today’s podcast, she'll teach you how.</p>
<p class="p1">I asked her what inspired her. “It’s really around the passionate belief that I could make things better,” she tells me. Her superpowers are her passion mixed with energy and focus.</p>
<p class="p1">She uses them to help others.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As governor, Jane </span>was passionate about education. She says all children have gifts. And this is true for adults, too. Maybe someone failed you – the school system, or your parents.</p>
<p class="p1">And now you’re grown up. You’re at a point in your life where you feel you should know what you’re doing with your finances, your career, your family. </p>
<p class="p1">Maybe you’re feeling lost now.</p>
<p class="p1">If no one patted your back, told you you’re special, and helped you figure out what you’re good at, you may feel like someone is sitting on your chest. You are lying there with weight, pressure, a heaviness inside you that says, "I’m stuck here." </p>
<p class="p1">But it’s not too late to find out what you’re good at.</p>
<p class="p1">Jane’s goal was, and still is, to give kids opportunities in life. Don’t you wish someone wanted the same for you now? I do.</p>
<p class="p1">The difference is, you have to choose yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">Part of that is surrounding yourself with the right people. Who are the right people? Jane says, “Sometimes, depending on the issue, the right people around the table are folks who you know well and trust a great deal.”</p>
<p class="p1">Plainly, if you pick the wrong people, you’ll be stressed and you’ll waste energy. How you spend your energy is your choice. And that’s powerful.</p>
<p class="p1">The other resource we crave is money. Campaigning, Jane didn’t have that either. She hustled.</p>
<p class="p1">"I tend to outwork people,” she says. “As a working mother, I’ve learned to work hard and smart.” She raised $60,000 for her campaign.</p>
<p class="p1">Some people wrote checks to support her. Others baked brownies, and she had bake sales… That’s old school hustling. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, to make things happen, you have to go back to the basics. You don’t become a superhero by trying to be a superhero. You become a superhero by overcoming whatever’s in your way. </span>“I had to be really crisp and really convincing, and really think through my position on a number of issues to convince people that a 25 year old woman, a couple of years out of college, would be a better state senator than a 7 term incumbent,” she says.</p>
<p class="p4">Start small. Try to improve 1% a day. The people who baked brownies helped at least 1%.</p>
<p class="p1">That’s how you gain momentum. And that’s what you’ll learn in today’s episode. You’ll learn how to hustle, earn power, and, if you’re lucky, become a superhero, too.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It won't be the idea that causes you to quit... it's fear.</p>
<p class="p1">It's the big idea that stops us—the idea of being a Google or a Facebook, a New York Times best-selling author, a guru, a YouTube sensation, a Mark Cuban or <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/11/ep-143-kevin-oleary-get-him-to-invest/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">Kevin O'Leary</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, it seems easier to forget you even had the idea to begin with. The idea of success. But if you give in, you'll end up quitting before you start.</p>
<p class="p1">It's a trap.</p>
<p class="p1">Think about how many people are on Earth. There are millions of attractive people I have never met because I didn't give myself the chance. I always thought, "She'd never have sex with me."I didn't even look. So I quit before I could start.</p>
<p class="p1">But staring at a girl is easy. And who knows what that leads to? If you want to achieve something, you need to make moves.</p>
<p class="p1">In today's podcast, you'll learn the steps you need to take to achieve anything.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest, Mary Karr, is an award-winning poet and best-selling memoirist with praise from Stephen King, among many other highly-esteemed writers. In the interview, Mary shares some easy techniques you can use to get started.</p>
<p class="p1">Number one, start with things that are easy or convenient, and build from there.</p>
<p class="p1">Identifying your interests is important, too. Mary started with reading. "Something about <a href="https://www.thealtucherreport.com/checkout/1/digital-virtual-mentor.php?utm_ad=26024&utm_placement=15&utm_medium=122%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">reading other people's life stories</span></a> made me less lonely," she says.</p>
<p class="p1">Mary explains that it's often "the thing that happened to you that was very dramatic that maybe nobody else would find dramatic," that make the best stories.</p>
<p class="p1">These little moments give you insight. That's what makes you capable of doing whatever you put your mind to. No one has your experiences, the order of those experiences, your relationships, your perspective, your talents, and your drive.</p>
<p class="p1">These pieces make you capable of doing something nobody else can. You have to work with what you have.</p>
<p class="p1">"I start with very convenient ideas and convenient memories in which I always appear to be doing beautiful and nimble things," she says, "and then it turns out I was the one making a lot of the trouble." When it's your story, who knows what will turn out?</p>
<p class="p1">Your experiences shape what you're capable of. And they shape what you're on your way to becoming. "No one can tell me what the shape of my mind is like better than me," Mary says.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to her literary success, Mary taught creative writing in jail. Why? "All of us who write are ultimately trying to make the world less lonely," she says.</p>
<p class="p1">If there's an impact you'd like to make, make it. Even if you're scared. "I'm never not scared," Mary says.</p>
<p class="p1">When I asked what she's scared of, I realized I've heard her list before. From myself. Scared of sounding like an idiot, being boring, "losing what little stature I've gained for myself."</p>
<p class="p1">If what you have is so little, then what is there to lose? That's how I picked myself up. I <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/08/habits-one-percent/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">improved 1% a day</span></a>. You can too.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today for techniques to get overcome fear of failure. You'll learn to look around you and discover opportunities. You'll let yourself stare.</p>

<p class="p1">These little moments give you insight. That's what makes you capable of doing whatever you put your mind to. No one has your experiences, the order of those experiences, your relationships, your perspective, your talents, and your drive.</p>
<p class="p1">These pieces make you capable of doing something nobody else can. You have to work with what you have.</p>
<p class="p1">"I start with very convenient ideas and convenient memories in which I always appear to be doing beautiful and nimble things," she says, "and then it turns out I was the one making a lot of the trouble." When it's your story, who knows what will turn out?</p>
<p class="p1">Your experiences shape what you're capable of. And they shape what you're on your way to becoming. "No one can tell me what the shape of my mind is like better than me," Mary says.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to her literary success, Mary taught creative writing in jail. Why? "All of us who write are ultimately trying to make the world less lonely," she says.</p>
<p class="p1">If there's an impact you'd like to make, make it. Even if you're scared. "I'm never not scared," Mary says.</p>
<p class="p1">When I asked what she's scared of, I realized I've heard her list before. From myself. Scared of sounding like an idiot, being boring, "losing what little stature I've gained for myself."</p>
<p class="p1">If what you have is so little, then what is there to lose? That's how I picked myself up. I <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/08/habits-one-percent/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank">improved 1% a day</a>. You can too.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today for techniques to get overcome fear of failure. You'll learn to look around you and discover opportunities. You'll let yourself stare.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Everyone I’ve ever dated (before my second marriage) was just practice. Telling my second grade crush I was in love with her and getting laughed at – practice. <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/11/floor-hopeless/"><span class="s1">Posing as a psychic on Craigslist</span></a> to meet women – practice.</p>
<p class="p1">I could have chosen not to do those things. I could have been too embarrassed or said I don’t want to be “that guy." But then I would have been holding myself back.</p>
<p class="p1">Don't waste time and energy contemplating if you'll be successful. I get it. You're afraid. You don't want to get stuck or let go of a good thing. Recognize, though, that your fear won't <a href="http://www.thealt"><span class="s1">generate wealth and freedom</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p2">So how do you know what's right financially? My guest today, Kevin O’Leary says, "There's no guarantee. You have to try things.”</p>
<p class="p1">Before becoming a successful entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and millionaire shark, Kevin tried and tested different jobs. He picked up garbage. This wasn’t for him. He wasn't invested.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes the key to success is to <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2010/11/dont-say-yes-when-you-want-to-say-no/"><span class="s1">say no</span></a>. Not to invest.</p>
<p class="p1">If you aren't invested, you can keep trying new things. That's what Kevin did. He tried something else, which he talks about in today's interview.</p>
<p class="p1">He just kept going. The idea is to <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2015/09/the-rich-empl"><span class="s1">find something more fulfilling</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">And even when you find it, keep an open mind. It might still be a test.</p>
<p class="p1">Kevin has a three-year rule. If something can't survive three years, then "take it behind the barn and shoot it," he says. Dump it. Quit it. Do not invest. "Unless it's a hobby and you don't mind losing money," he says.</p>
<p class="p1">This rule applies to dating, too. If you don’t see a future with someone, why continue? Consider how much you’re spending, or “investing,” in dating someone.</p>
<p class="p1">And think of it the other way around. Can you survive it for three years? Or three more years? Kevin waited six before marrying Linda. Now they’ve been married for 25 years.</p>
<p class="p1">In his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1476734445/?tag=jamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>Cold Hard Truth On Men, Women, and Money: 50 Common Money Mistakes and How to Fix Them</em></span></a>, and in today's interview, Kevin teaches you how to avoid making bad investments in your life with simple, easy-to-follow tips.</p>
<p class="p1">Smart investments require time. You need time to find out who and what you’re compatible with. And those things change. You change. So when you feel stuck or unfulfilled, don’t just cry about it. “There’s no room for tears,” Mr. Wonderful says. Do something.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today to learn the best techniques to test a potential investment. You’ll also hear Kevin’s advice on how to successfully get people invested in you.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 141 - Judy Blume: Stop Wondering "What is it all for?"</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If she told me to jump off a bridge, I just might do it. She was the only friend who would tell me anything, and I would do anything for her.</p>
<p class="p1">I think I love her.</p>
<p class="p1">Growing up, I wanted to know everything—sex, bullying, whether I was normal or not.</p>
<p class="p1">I was curious—confused really. Kids were mean and girls were pretty.</p>
<p class="p1">Judy Blume was the only one who would answer my questions.</p>
<p class="p1">I was asking, “What is it all for?” And she told me. I thought, maybe this is what finding God feels like.</p>
<p class="p1">She’s a No. 1 <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author with more than 85 million books sold. Successful? Yes. But it’s more than that.</p>
<p class="p1">“I represent childhood,” she says, “I think when somebody represents your childhood, that’s special. I’m lucky people tell me that.”</p>
<p class="p1">Her book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1481414437/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">Forever</span></a>,” taught me about sex. “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1481414402/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">Blubber</span></a>” explained bullying. I read Judy Blume’s books because I had questions and she had answers.</p>
<p class="p1">So where did she come from?</p>
<p class="p1">At age 25, a man took her on a date. He stayed the night and never left.</p>
<p class="p1">They got married, had two little babies, but Judy realized she had stories but no other outlets. “I wouldn’t say I had exactly grown up when I started to write, but I was in a grown-up situation.”</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, as grown-ups, we stop taking care of ourselves. We neglect our needs, health, relationships, and friendships. But if you’re open to living a better life, you’ll learn something from Judy Blume.</p>
<p class="p1">She used to feel stuck, too. <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2012/02/how-to-break-free-from-being-stuck/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">Stuck and lonely</span></a>. “I understand now how important friendship is in a life, no matter how happy you are with your family,” she says.</p>
<p class="p1">Do you feel a void, too? What’s missing here?</p>
<p class="p1">Judy realized she needed to take care of herself. “Before I started to write, I was sick all the time. I was always sick. I had one exotic illness after another, but once I started writing I was letting that bad stuff out and it didn’t have to make me sick anymore,” she says.</p>
<p class="p1">Writing helped her and it helped us, but we’re still wondering, “What is it all for?”</p>
<p class="p1">Uncertainty and darkness. “Would you say that’s the overriding theme of the book,” I asked.</p>
<p class="p1">“You’re interesting,” Judy says. “I’m a person who never knows the theme of her book.”</p>
<p class="p1">Her new book, “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1101875046/?tag=jamesaltuc-20%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">In The Unlikely Event</span></a>,” is an opportunity for me, for you, for everyone “to be taken out of our own lives, to get insight into other people’s lives, as well as our own lives, and to learn new things.”</p>
<p class="p1">Listen now to Judy Blume. No bridge necessary.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 140 - Amy Koppelman: Write Something That Doesn't Suck</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is for the writers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Write something that doesn't suck. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It's a simple goal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With low stakes, Amy Koppelman wrote "I Smile Back," which was rejected at least 80 times. It was rejected because it resembled the truth too much. One publisher said, "This is the reason we got into publishing, but I can't sell this."</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, Sara Silverman is starring in the movie. She's the main character, Laney. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was scared for the Laney. The book bleeds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes you have to feel sorry for someone else to stop feeling sorry for yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good fiction can do that. It's how you can escape. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They say you can't run away from yourself. But they lie all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amy wrote letters. She was depressed. She needed an escape. When she recognized sadness in someone else, she wrote him letters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Years later, with a pair of scissors, she cut and pasted a story together. That's how she got her book. She wrote with scissors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In today's interview, Amy reveals how you write great fiction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wanted to know about the sadness inside her. Does it come from a deeper, darker truth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Amy says the best kind of writing understands you somehow without even knowing you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It helps you understand yourself better. "All of us, whether we're writers, carpenters or teachers, we just want to be heard and understood," Amy says.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever you're doing now, you don't know what it's doing for your future. That's why I recommend a daily practice. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Amy doesn't have a daily practice. She used to sit and wonder when she'd make coffee again. </p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Depression made instant coffee look impossible. Everything loomed over her. But one day she made coffee. And over the course of many small victories, she survived. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Listen to Amy Koppelman to learn how to write to survive. This is the master of fiction that bleeds.</p>]]></description>

<p class="p1">In today's interview, Amy reveals how you write great fiction.</p>
<p class="p1">I wanted to know about the sadness inside her. Does it come from a deeper, darker truth?</p>
<p class="p1">Amy says the best kind of writing understands you somehow without even knowing you.</p>
<p class="p1">It helps you understand yourself better. "All of us, whether we're writers, carpenters or teachers, we just want to be heard and understood," Amy says.</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever you're doing now, you don't know what it's doing for your future. That's why I recommend a daily practice. </p>
<p class="p2">Amy doesn't have a daily practice. She used to sit and wonder when she'd make coffee again. </p>
<p class="p1">Depression made instant coffee look impossible. Everything loomed over her. But one day she made coffee. And over the course of many small victories, she survived. </p>
<p class="p2">Listen to Amy Koppelman to learn how to write to survive. This is the master of fiction that bleeds.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="p1">James does, and today the author of that book joins him on <em>The James Altucher Show</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Many of you know James does a Twitter Q&A every Thursday. But what you probably didn't know is that before he jumps online he rereads one book...</p>
<p class="p1">He turns to Sugar for inspiration.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Sugar is the fictional character in Cheryl Strayed's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307949338/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307949338&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s2">Tiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar</span></a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Cheryl Strayed has had a rough life: sexual abuse, divorce, past drug abuse, and her mother's death. All this pushed her to do something radical with her life.</p>
<p class="p1">She decided to take a hike. Not your everyday hike; she would hike more than a thousand miles of the Pacific Coast Trail from the Mojave Desert through California, Oregon, and Washington – and she did it alone.</p>
<p class="p1">The hike finally healed her, and she turned it into her NY Times bestselling memoir, <span class="s3"><em>Wild</em>.</span> The book was then turned into a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/"><span class="s3">movie</span></a> starring Reese Witherspoon.</p>
<p class="p1">Oprah loved the book so much she restarted her <a href="http://amzn.to/1Q3oVhR"><span class="s3">book club</span></a> just to highlight it.</p>
<p class="p1">Cheryl's new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101946903/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1101946903&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s3"><em>Brave Enough</em></span></a> was just released in October. James asks her, "Why a book of quotes?"</p>
<p class="p1">As Cheryl says in the introduction of her book...</p>
<p class="p1">"I've always been a quote collector... From the comic to the profound, the simple to the complex, the sorrowful to the ecstatic, the inspiring to the stern, whenever I need consolation or encouragement, a clear-eyed perspective or a swift kick in the pants – which is often – quotes are what I turn to. They've been tacked to the walls of every home I've made. I've written them down in my journals and kept them on files in my computer. I've scribbled them on the back of ripped-open envelopes and drawn them across stretches of sand."</p>
<p class="p1">Now that they've met, James is almost sorry, as he'll not be able to steal from her so easily going forward.</p>

			<title>Ep. 137 - Bryan Johnson, Braintree: Everyone Has Pebble in Their Own Shoe</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you’re running your own business, then you know by now that you have to care about what you’re doing if you want to be successful.</p>
<p class="p1">Making money can be a goal, but it can’t be your only goal. You have to work toward something greater than just turning a profit.</p>
<p class="p1">On today’s podcast I talk with Bryan Johnson, someone who knows full well how much you have to care if you want your investments to pay off, and he’s found the perfect balance between being financially successful and changing the world. </p>
<p class="p1">I talked with Bryan two years ago (and I actually put the interview in my book <a href="http://amzn.to/1McibgI"><span class="s1"><em>Choose Yourself</em></span></a>!).</p>
<p class="p1">I invited him to that first interview because he had established Braintree, a payment platform for many online businesses and entrepreneurs, and it was immensely successful.</p>
<p class="p1">But I’m bringing him back this time around because a lot has changed in two years.</p>
<p class="p1">Bryan sold Braintree to Ebay for $800 million and has since used that money to start a venture capital fund for what he likes to call “save the world” sort of companies.</p>
<p class="p1">He’s looking for engineers, creators, and financiers who are creating platforms, companies, and businesses that could benefit the lives of billions of people.</p>
<p class="p1">He talks about what kinds of fields and platforms he’s interested in on today’s show, and he explains the passion that’s driving him. </p>
<p class="p1">“I have a burning desire to devote my life to improve the lives of people,” he says when I ask him what inspired his approach to business. “But I didn’t know what that meant at 21. So I decided I’d become an entrepreneur, retire by 30, and then spend the rest of my life with an abundance of time and money trying to do some good.”</p>
<p class="p1">That definitely explains why he sold Braintree, but he also gives insight into what made this first business venture of his so successful and how he used it to kick start his true goal for helping people.</p>
<p class="p1">Combining business with philanthropy is Bryan’s main focus, and he is actively seeking those who are creating the technologies people cannot find but desperately need, such as synthetic biology for combating diseases like Alzheimer’s.  </p>
<p class="p1">On today’s podcast, Bryan goes into what it takes to get into what he calls the “ecosystem of contribution” and how you can contribute to his charitable cycle by:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Learning his unique three goals when it comes to running a successful business </li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Looking at our planet Earth as its own technological platform </li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">Focusing on what makes you – and your business – happy and helpful</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2"> </span>Leaning how to avoid snobbery in small business </li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">If you’ve got a humanitarian approach to business like Bryan does and are actively looking to engage with the game changers of the world who are focusing their efforts on building a better world, then this podcast is geared at you.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyone can be successful for themselves, but being successful for the sake of others is truly admirable and Bryan’s approach will no doubt help you build a better business for yourself and your clients.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today’s guest changed my life. Seeing as he helped to invent Blogger and Twitter, he probably changed your life too!</p>
<p class="p3">The Internet’s last decade and a half of development as a forum for writing has taken place in large part on platforms built in part by Ev Williams.</p>
<p class="p1">Evan “Ev” Williams is on the show today to talk about his new blogging platform, Medium, and how he worked his way up to the top spot he is now.</p>
<p class="p1">“I worked my whole life basically broke and in debt,” he tells me, and this may be a familiar situation for you.</p>
<p class="p1">Struggling to realize your dreams, working hard to create something new the public wants – we’ve all experienced these efforts in one way or another, and some of your attempts may have been more successful than others.</p>
<p class="p1">The hardest part about running your own business is not only having the confidence to take the risks, but also to pull yourself together if that risk should fail. Even success can come with its own stress.</p>
<p class="p1">Working to create Blogger and Twitter led Ev to a ton of success in media, but he talks about the strange kind of success Google brought him and how you don’t always necessarily know what to do with it.</p>
<p class="p1">In fact, he didn’t handle success very well at all the first time. As he said in an article in <em>The New York Times </em>“It wasn’t obvious to me that I wanted to sell my business,” he tells me when Google came asking for Blogger and absorbed him into the company. He was dedicated to seeing it become successful, but he did not know the rules and language of corporate success, and he ran into many roadblocks along the way.</p>
<p class="p1">Of course, we know from hindsight that whatever he did was right, but how can you be sure of the outcome when you’re just starting on the path?</p>
<p class="p1">Ev shares his answers to this difficult question, and his insightful advice on today’s podcast will teach you</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">- How to find product-market fit for your business</li>
<li class="li1">- How to monetize your web and media content in different ways</li>
<li class="li1">- How to use multiple media platforms to reach your audience</li>
<li class="li1">- How to use more than a website to get real interaction with your audience and clients</li>

			<title>Ep. 135 - Naveen Jain: The Billionaire Who Wants to Go To The Moon</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Naveen Jain is the founder and CEO of one of the biggest companies from the dot-com boom era, and now he has set his sights on the moon.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">His company, <a href="http://www.moonexpress.com/"><span class="s1">Moon Express</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">plans to send a rocket to the moon as a business venture to collect rare minerals and resources, and then bring them back to Earth. He also plans to make travel to the moon and other planets accessible to all of us at some point in the future. </span></a></p>
<p class="p1">Naveen is the founder of<a href="http://infospace.com/"><span class="s1"> InfoSpace</span></a>, the first company to develop services that were sold to other companies that then white-labeled those services on their own web sites. According to Naveen, InfoSpace was the first company to realize that people would eventually want to use the internet on mobile devices.</p>
<p class="p1">Naveen co-founded <a href="http://www.intelius.com/"><span class="s1">Intelius</span></a>, the information commerce company that gives users access to basic information about people all on one site.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2010, Naveen started Moon Express with the goal of bringing rare minerals back to the Earth for use in a number of applications, such as energy uses. Going to the moon is not the only goal of Moon Express, and Naveen sees it as the start of developing a multi-planetary society.</p>
<p class="p1">Naveen explains how Moon Express will become both commercially viable and also sustainable as a company.</p>
<p class="p1">In addition to space, Naveen sees the medical diagnostics field as another big industry in which he sees potential large growth over the next five to ten years. Naveen says the biggest societal problems offer entrepreneurs the most opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1">Education is another field in which he sees a need to address training for current jobs that weren't around 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="p1">Also, another important area is looking for solutions for at-risk countries that do not have accessible, clean drinking water.</p>
<p class="p1">Naveen believes we need to first solve our own internal problems before we tackle the world's problems. He thinks being at peace with who we are, and finding our purpose and mission, are key factors to finding that solution.</p>
<p class="p1">He says the process of becoming more fluent in producing ideas lies in having intellectual curiosity, learning for the sake of learning, and getting basic fundamental knowledge in the areas that interest us.</p>
<p class="p1">As far as finding our own mission in life, Naveen says ask yourself "What would you do if you had a billion dollars?" He says do that career now, and you'll find a business around it.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This week I've got something important to say to every message board across the internet: "Everyone wants to save the world, but no one wants to help mom with the dishes."</p>
<p class="p1">Sound familiar? That's PJ O'Rourke, world-renowned talking head and published author, whose political humor and commentary make him the butt of many an insult on message boards everywhere.</p>
<p class="p1">He's on the show today to talk about politics and why humor is always the best policy, especially if you want to really make a difference.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to being funny in politics, humor is your only option. "You really don't have a choice," PJ tells me. "To take it seriously is to indicate you're an idiot."</p>
<p class="p1">And the same applies to the way you run your business, so be careful! If you take yourself too seriously, you're only going to end up missing out on the important, finer details. Because even in business you are still involved in politics one way or the other.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe you're the member of a committee, maybe you design your staff meetings as a form of democracy – either way, there is an election process, a conversation, and a show of hands that can represent your decision or point of view.</p>
<p class="p1">And you need to be educated in your field if you ever hope to find the humor in it. Because finding the humor in your point of view means you are much more likely to start the right kind of conversations to get people on your side.</p>
<p class="p1">Unlike politics though, comedy is hard. "I have more respect for comedians like Jay Leno and Chris Rock," PJ says, after I asked him if he respected them more than Joe Biden. And that's saying something.</p>
<p class="p1">Humor gives you the power to generate conversations, and PJ's quirky sense of humor lends this week's show some hilarious viewpoints on these conversation starters:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">• </span>The government's role in regulating capitalism and big businesses</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">• </span>The time and place for politics</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">• </span>How to find humor in high-stakes political situations</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">• </span>How comedy can change the way the world sees a situation, especially through the lens of the internet</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">PJ's latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080212366X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=080212366X&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s2"><em>Thrown Under the Omnibus</em></span></a>, comes out October 6 </p>
<p class="p1">"Is that when it's coming out? No one told me!" says P.J.</p>
<p class="p1">The book touches on these themes, but his conversation with me on the show today is full of the kind of jokes you want to be able to tell at your next networking event.</p>
<p class="p1">So listen in and see how you can be the funny man (or woman) at your next business meeting.</p>

			<title>Ep. 133 - Tucker Max: Mate: Become the Man Women Want</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This is my first threesome on the show! Tucker Max, Nils Parker, and Dr. Jeff Miller are all here to discuss their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316375365/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316375365&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>Mate: Become the Man Women Want</em></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">But what does dating have to do with business?</p>
<p class="p1">Believe it or not, marketing yourself for social relationships is related to marketing your business for success. In fact, from Tucker's point of view, they're almost one in the same. "Dating and sex is [seen as] a battle between men and women, and that's totally wrong."</p>
<p class="p1">He says, "You want to create win-win relationships," a relationship where you and your partner(s), whether they be professional or romantic, both come out on top is exactly what you should be seeking.</p>
<p class="p1">When Jeff and Tucker met over a steak dinner to discuss Jeff's recent social and evolutionary psychology talk at a conference, it wasn't necessarily a romantic meal.</p>
<p class="p1">Jeff's point of view is not trickling down to the young men and women who could truly benefit from his kind of information, and both authors were worried about the perceived misconceptions regarding their work.</p>
<p class="p1">"I was appalled at how they misunderstood and misapplied it," Jeff says of his first book. "I wrote <a href="http://www"><em>The Mating Mind</em></a> a long time ago, '98/'99, and the science has moved on."</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This is my first threesome on the show! Tucker Max, Nils Parker, and Dr. Jeff Miller are all here to discuss their new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316375365/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316375365&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>Mate: Become the Man Women Want</em></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">But what does dating have to do with business?</p>
<p class="p1">Believe it or not, marketing yourself for social relationships is related to marketing your business for success. In fact, from Tucker's point of view, they're almost one in the same. "Dating and sex is [seen as] a battle between men and women, and that's totally wrong."</p>
<p class="p1">He says, "You want to create win-win relationships," a relationship where you and your partner(s), whether they be professional or romantic, both come out on top is exactly what you should be seeking.</p>
<p class="p1">When Jeff and Tucker met over a steak dinner to discuss Jeff's recent social and evolutionary psychology talk at a conference, it wasn't necessarily a romantic meal.</p>
<p class="p1">Jeff's point of view is not trickling down to the young men and women who could truly benefit from his kind of information, and both authors were worried about the perceived misconceptions regarding their work.</p>
<p class="p1">"I was appalled at how they misunderstood and misapplied it," Jeff says of his first book. "I wrote <a href="http://www"><em>The Mating Mind</em></a> a long time ago, '98/'99, and the science has moved on."</p>
<p class="p1">But even with a modern point of view that speaks distinctively with that <em>fratire</em> tone of voice, Tucker Max still experienced the same problem. "I assumed when I wrote the stories that everyone got the subtext," Tucker says. "[But] the guys didn't even have a basic foundational set of knowledge about life or about women or about social relationships that they could put my stories into context."</p>
<p class="p1">And this is why a deep understanding of social relationships is nothing but beneficial for your business.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">How do you summarize a highly colorful life of an inventor, billionaire and philanthropist?</p>
<p class="p1">In this episode of <em>The James Altucher Show</em>, our guest is John McAfee. James and John talk about the high and low points of John's life.</p>
<p class="p1">Just days after this interview, John announced he is running for President of the United States.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen to John and see if you can decide if he's going to get your vote.</p>
<p class="p1">He is probably best known for McAfee antivirus software, which he created while working as a programmer for Lockheed Martin.</p>
<p class="p1">Even with extraordinary success, John never measured his self-worth with his net-worth. Rather, he saved more than $30 million since he began McAfee. After a time, he turned the reins of of his successful antivirus company to Bill Larson, former VP of IBM.</p>
<p class="p1">John has had a controversial career. He's spent his life on the run, has admitted to using and selling illegal drugs and has been arrested for illegal possession of firearms in the U.S.</p>
<p class="p1">Despite this, he still remains ever-relevant decades later. He is still the most influential authority on information security in the world and a widely sought speaker on that topic. So it did not come as a surprise that just recently he's come under fire for writing about the real culprit behind the Ashley Madison data brouhaha.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">Episode highlights:</p>
<p class="p1">How he created the McAfee antivirus out of curiosity, never expecting it take off.</p>
<p class="p1">His unhappiness with the administrative aspect of running an enterprise and why he stopped running the company.</p>
<p class="p1">His life on the run, after experiencing threat and extortion from the government of Belize.</p>
<p class="p1">Reinventing his business and reorganizing his life after losing all his money when forced to leave Belize.</p>
<p class="p1">Talking about his natural antibiotics venture in Quorum sensing. His foray into biohacking is touted to be 15 years advanced in terms of research.</p>
<p class="p1">Problems confronting the Internet landscape nowadays, the loss of privacy and what he does to stop it.</p>
<p class="p1">Being rich and famous never bothered John McAfee, he stays true to himself and does what he knows best: being unreasonable even if the world doesn't agree with his opinions.</p>
<p class="p1">And there was the matter of losing all of his money and investments, hiding like a fugitive and finally getting extradited to the U.S. Also not a problem; John just continued to find ways to start another internet-security firm called Future Tense Central, the technology of which is leaning toward consumer mobile-device apps, company privacy, and security-sharing software.</p>
<p class="p1">His purpose nowadays is more focused on preventing the loss of privacy and warning against the evil of using gadgets, downloading convenience apps and storing information on the cloud because there are ways to 'spy' and fish for personal information.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Penn Jillette is a famous magician – he's one half of the duo Penn and Teller. He has made a career out of sleight of hand and tricks. He credits Teller with getting him into magic. Penn's specialties are juggling, writing, and comedy. He suggests that when you choose a career you go into a field in which you know you can improve.</p>
<p class="p1">He continued his education at "clown college." He was "forced" into comedy, but he wanted to be a brooding French poet. While at clown college, he learned wire walking, juggling, and tumbling. Penn says card tricks are actually a form of juggling.</p>

<p class="p1">When he first began with Teller they went to bad magic shows and learned what they didn't want to do. They wanted to get away from illusions and focus more on tricks. All magic is about the perception of truth.</p>
<p class="p1">Penn says he didn't have a choice in magic. He was homeless when he started out, but Teller was from a very different background. The pair didn't like each other, but they felt they could do better together.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">This weekend Dr. Wayne Dyer passed away.</p>
<p class="p2"> </p>
<p class="p1">James wants to recognize the influence Wayne Dyer has had on his life. We're very sad about his passing.</p>
<p class="p1">Here is one of the last interviews Wayne Dyer has done and it is with James... </p>
<p class="p1">During that interview James asked Dr. Dyer what he saw as the arc of his career. "What has your message been and how have you seen it evolve?"</p>
<p class="p1">Without hesitating, Dr. Dyer responded...</p>
<p class="p1">"Well, it's really been always about self-reliance, in one form or another. I've often said that I really feel that I had a conversation with God just before I showed up here on this planet in 1940 and I was asked, 'What would you like to do on this trip?' And I said, 'Well, I think I'd like to teach self-reliance.' And God said, 'You want to do that for an entire lifetime? Just teach self-reliance?'</p>
<p class="p1">"I said, 'Yes, that would be a great lifetime.' And he said, 'Well, then, we'd better get your little ass into an orphanage and we'd better let you have all of these different experiences, so that once people start to question that, you will never be dissuaded because you'll have the experience of it.' So everything in my life has been directed towards teaching people how to have self-reliance. It has shifted from psychology and an emphasis on psychological principles, to spiritual principles, and that's something that I really had nothing to do with personally; that was just the direction that I was destined to go."</p>
<p class="p1">They concluded their conversation with the following exchange...</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Wayne Dyer:Think about your body, the body that you're in. You're in a male body, I'm in a male body. And I'm in a body that's about 6'2", it has blue eyes, it has no hair on its head, it has certain characteristics and so on, and inessence, that's why, for this incarnation, I'm doomed.</p>
<p class="p1">I'm doomed to live – I'm not gonna be in a female, 4'10" body. I'm not gonna be in any other – this is the body that I get, okay? Now, what kind of choices do I have to make within that context? Well, I can decide how healthy it's gonna be. I can decide whether I'm gonna exercise it or not.</p>
<p class="p1">I can decide actually how long it's gonna live.</p>
<p class="p1">There's many, many choices that I make about this body within the context of being doomed to live in this body and not any other body. Now, if you take this metaphor and you extend it to not just the physical body but to the rest of your life and all that you are, you are, in essence – you are given a dharma. You showed up here with a purpose. You showed up here with an energy that propels – and there's something that excites you, and it's like whether you want to be a falconer or whether you want to be a musician or whether you want to be a writer or whether you want to raise horses in Montana.</p>
<p class="p1">Whatever it might be, there's something that excites you. Now, you have been doomed; in other words, this is your dharma. This is what you're here for. But you're making choices.</p>
<p class="p1">And the choices that you make all along, all the course corrections that you make, involve,</p>
<p class="p1">"Am I willing? Am I willing to do whatever it takes to make this come true?" I've always been willing.</p>
<p class="p1">"Are you determined?" That is, are you gonna not let anything interfere with it? Yes. You have to have that determination.</p>
<p class="p1">"Am I fearless?" In other words, am I gonna get the fear out of me and come from a place of love, from divine love?</p>
<p class="p1">"Am I using compassion?" Compassion for myself and compassion for others, and ultimately,</p>
<p class="p1">"Do I reach that state? " The highest rung on the ladder, if you will, when Rumi said, "When you are born, a ladder is placed before you to help you to escape from this world.' And so to understand that you're in this world but you're not of this world, and when you reach the top of the ladder, the top rung on that ladder of divine love, you realize that, yes, you are doomed. You have been. You're to be a writer, you're to do all these things, but you also make choices and course corrections along the way, just like the choice you make about how your body is going to be.</p>
<p class="p1">When you understand that, when you understand that you showed up here for a reason and a purpose and, "Now I'm gonna be willing, I'm gonna be fearless, I'm gonna be determined, I'm gonna be passionate," then you can live your life without regrets. I just read a book called <em>The Five Regrets of the Dying</em>, by a woman in Australia who is a hospice nurse, and she interviewed people every day who were dying, and asked them what were their regrets. </p>
<p class="p1">She wrote a book about it, and the number one regret of people who were under her hospice care, the number one regret of the people dying was, "I wish I'd had the courage to live my life the way I knew I should, rather than listening to other people tell me what to do." That's the essence of it all.</p>
<p class="p1">James Altucher:   That's really important, because as you said, you're doomed to make your choices, but if you don't make your choices, you're even more doomed.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Wayne Dyer:   Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p class="p1">James Altucher:   'Cause someone else is making the choices for you. And on that note, Wayne, I really appreciate you spending the time and on this interview. I really want recommend <em>I Can See Clearly Now</em>. It's a great book, it's inspirational. I also recommend all of the books that you referenced in the book and in this interview, because I think they're all transformational books, and again, once again, thank you for coming on this show and being interviewed.</p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Wayne Dyer:   It's my pleasure. God bless you. Good luck to you, my friend.</p>
<p class="p1">James Altucher:   Thanks, Wayne.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class="p1">Dr. Wayne Dyer:   Namaste</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today James welcomes Josh Foer to the podcast. Josh is a U.S. Memory champion, award-winning journalist, and bestselling author of <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143120530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143120530&linkCode=as2&tag="> <span class="s1">Moonwalking with Einstein</span></a>, which details his journey to becoming a U.S. memory champion.</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">                                         ============</p> <p class="p1"><strong>Special Note</strong>: Both Josh and James will be presenting LIVE at next month's Stansberry Conference in Las Vegas. If you're interested in joining them and over 30 additional speakers for two full days <a href= "https://orders.cloudsna.com/chain?cid=MKT062471&eid=MKT121529&snaid=&step=start"> <span class="s1">click here</span></a>.</p> <p class="p1">This year's Conference will take place at one of the newest and most luxurious destinations on Las Vegas Boulevard -- the Aria Resort and Casino.</p> <p class="p3">                                        ============</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Taking some of the ancient memory techniques he learned during a yearlong trip to Europe, Josh was quickly able to master techniques that have not yet made their way across "the pond."</p> <p class="p2">Having this advantage over American competitors allowed him to become very successful in a short amount of time.</p> <p class="p1">Once he brought these European techniques back to the U.S. and started sharing them, the U.S. record for memorizing a deck of cards went from  1 minute 40 seconds to just 30 seconds.</p> <p class="p1">One concerning question that comes to mind for both James and Josh is whether some of the modern technologies in our current world are reducing our capacity to remember things.</p> <p class="p1">Is Googling making us less smart?</p> <p class="p1">And this is not a new question, it dates all the way back to the days of Socrates, and the advent of the written word. These concerns may be valid, but it often just means a change in both how and what we remember.</p> <p class="p1">One of the most common questions that Josh gets is about remembering people's names. For this he has a great memory hack: Create a secondary association with the thing you're trying to remember. For people's names this can be a funny association with the sound of their name.</p> <p class="p1">For prose, associate it with a song or rhyme.

Josh is a U.S. Memory champion, award-winning journalist, and bestselling author of <a href= "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143120530/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143120530&linkCode=as2&tag="> Moonwalking with Einstein</a>, which details his journey to becoming a U.S. memory champion.</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p3">                                         ============</p> <p class="p1">Special Note: Both Josh and James will be presenting LIVE at next month's Stansberry Conference in Las Vegas. If you're interested in joining them and over 30 additional speakers for two full days <a href= "https://orders.cloudsna.com/chain?cid=MKT062471&eid=MKT121529&snaid=&step=start"> click here</a>.</p> <p class="p1">This year's Conference will take place at one of the newest and most luxurious destinations on Las Vegas Boulevard -- the Aria Resort and Casino.</p> <p class="p3">                                        ============</p> <p class="p2"> </p> <p class="p1">Taking some of the ancient memory techniques he learned during a yearlong trip to Europe, Josh was quickly able to master techniques that have not yet made their way across "the pond."</p> <p class="p2">Having this advantage over American competitors allowed him to become very successful in a short amount of time.</p> <p class="p1">Once he brought these European techniques back to the U.S. and started sharing them, the U.S. record for memorizing a deck of cards went from  1 minute 40 seconds to just 30 seconds.</p> <p class="p1">One concerning question that comes to mind for both James and Josh is whether some of the modern technologies in our current world are reducing our capacity to remember things.</p> <p class="p1">Is Googling making us less smart?</p> <p class="p1">And this is not a new question, it dates all the way back to the days of Socrates, and the advent of the written word. These concerns may be valid, but it often just means a change in both how and what we remember.</p> <p class="p1">One of the most common questions that Josh gets is about remembering people's names. For this he has a great memory hack: Create a secondary association with the thing you're trying to remember. For people's names this can be a funny association with the sound of their name.</p> <p class="p1">For prose, associate it with a song or rhyme.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">James Hong is one of the founders of the infamous site <a href="https://hotornot.com/"><span class="s1">Hot or Not</span></a>. What started out as an innocent experiment turned into a cultural phenomenon and lucrative business.</p>
<p class="p1">Hot or Not was a website that allowed users to upload their photos to the site so that other users could rate them as "hot" or "not." Soon after, a dating site was added, and a new form of internet speed dating began.</p>
<p class="p1">Hot or Not was part of the dawn of social media, preceding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"><span class="s1">Youtube</span></a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><span class="s1">Facebook</span></a>, and sites like <a href="https://www.gotinder.com/"><span class="s1">Tinder</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">James shares his observations of human nature and how the site proved age-old truths about attraction.</p>
<p class="p1">People who submitted the photos were, for the most part, confident enough to know the site was all in good fun. Others took it too seriously. In the long run, "hotter" people found the site and stayed based on the reaction to their photos.</p>
<p class="p1">James and his partner built the site as a side project that started out with an invite to friends – and grew to 30 thousand visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">Online source photos were used to begin the concept of the site. James estimates about 100 photos were used. Within 7 hours, the site was populated with real users wanting to be rated.</p>
<p class="p1">The instant success was a little overwhelming for James and his partner.</p>
<p class="p1">Machines and internet service were much more expensive in the early 2000s. So much so, the site was almost shut down because the equipment couldn't keep up with the site!</p>
<p class="p1">They moved Hot or Not to <span class="s1">GeoCities</span><span class="s2">, </span>and changed the future of the site. They made a deal with <a href="http://www.ophoto.me/"><span class="s1">Ophoto</span></a> as an affiliate. The final step was a business deal with Rack Space, which hosted the site for an exchange of publicity.</p>
<p class="p1">Companies called, wanting to buy this new business, but James and his partner wanted to see where it was going.</p>
<p class="p1">James says that the first year was all hard work. The dating service was the first attempt at monetizing the site. The dating site was linked to Hot or Not, and to go on with the site required one participant to be a paid member.</p>
<p class="p1">James compares the success of Hot or Not to the early days of reality shows. Hot or Not has been credited with creating 5 to 10 marriages a day.</p>
<p class="p2">Hot or Not was eventually sold in February of 2008. With the financial crash of 2008, James and his partner decided liquidizing the company was the wisest move.</p>
<p class="p1">James has always considered the future of business to be entrepreneur-focused rather than capital-focused. Hot or Not is a prime example of how the internet can make this possible.</p>
<p class="p1">James's suggestion to the newcomers in this business would simply be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">"Just do it."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Concepts don't have to be complex to work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1">If the interface works, then don't complicate it.</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">James Hong is one of the founders of the infamous site <a href="https://hotornot.com/">Hot or Not</a>. What started out as an innocent experiment turned into a cultural phenomenon and lucrative business.</p>
<p class="p1">Hot or Not was a website that allowed users to upload their photos to the site so that other users could rate them as "hot" or "not." Soon after, a dating site was added, and a new form of internet speed dating began.</p>
<p class="p1">Hot or Not was part of the dawn of social media, preceding <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, and sites like <a href="https://www.gotinder.com/">Tinder</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">James shares his observations of human nature and how the site proved age-old truths about attraction.</p>
<p class="p1">People who submitted the photos were, for the most part, confident enough to know the site was all in good fun. Others took it too seriously. In the long run, "hotter" people found the site and stayed based on the reaction to their photos.</p>
<p class="p1">James and his partner built the site as a side project that started out with an invite to friends – and grew to 30 thousand visitors.</p>
<p class="p1">Online source photos were used to begin the concept of the site. James estimates about 100 photos were used. Within 7 hours, the site was populated with real users wanting to be rated.</p>
<p class="p1">The instant success was a little overwhelming for James and his partner.</p>
<p class="p1">Machines and internet service were much more expensive in the early 2000s. So much so, the site was almost shut down because the equipment couldn't keep up with the site!</p>
<p class="p1">They moved Hot or Not to GeoCities, and changed the future of the site. They made a deal with <a href="http://www.ophoto.me/">Ophoto</a> as an affiliate. The final step was a business deal with Rack Space, which hosted the site for an exchange of publicity.</p>
<p class="p1">Companies called, wanting to buy this new business, but James and his partner wanted to see where it was going.</p>
<p class="p1">James says that the first year was all hard work. The dating service was the first attempt at monetizing the site. The dating site was linked to Hot or Not, and to go on with the site required one participant to be a paid member.</p>
<p class="p1">James compares the success of Hot or Not to the early days of reality shows. Hot or Not has been credited with creating 5 to 10 marriages a day.</p>
<p class="p2">Hot or Not was eventually sold in February of 2008. With the financial crash of 2008, James and his partner decided liquidizing the company was the wisest move.</p>
<p class="p1">James has always considered the future of business to be entrepreneur-focused rather than capital-focused. Hot or Not is a prime example of how the internet can make this possible.</p>
<p class="p1">James's suggestion to the newcomers in this business would simply be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">"Just do it."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1">Concepts don't have to be complex to work.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="p1">If the interface works, then don't complicate it.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Resources and Links:</p>
<ul>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">By its very nature, social media lends itself to users showing the highlights of their lives and sharing their best moments, but only after they've cropped, edited and refined those moments.</p>
<p class="p1">Casey Neistat, the prolific creator of YouTube videos that have made us look at our world a bit differently, thinks it's time we use social media to share the authentic moments of our lives.</p>
<p class="p1">His new app Beme allows for social media interaction to take on a new level of realness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Casey Neistat</span>, film director, producer, and YouTube creator, has gained a huge following. Millions of people look forward to his daily vlog on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat"><span class="s1">YouTube channel</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">Casey and I recorded a podcast back in January 2015 (<a href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/Frank-Curzio/Latest-Episodes/Episode/890/AA-Ep-202-Casey-Neistat-How-to-Get-to-13-Million-YouTube-Views"><span class="s2">Ask Altucher Ep 202</span></a>). What brings us together this time is a new app that Casey co-founded that  could significantly change how people view social media.</p>
<p class="p1">Named <a href="https://beme.com/"><span class="s1">Beme</span></a>, the app uses snippets of videos the user takes and then sends them to other Beme users. It does so without giving the user the opportunity to edit the video. Casey says that without scrutinizing the images of ourselves, we are able to bring honesty and authenticity to the things we send out as we share how we see the world.</p>
<p class="p1">As you use the app, your phone screens turns off and captures what you are seeing. Casey explains Beme has various discovery cells, with one that specifically focuses on strangers and includes the nearby stranger, the interesting stranger, and the faraway stranger.</p>
<p class="p1">Each discovery cell  is a part of your social media network and allows you to look in on what it is seeing. Casey says Beme is built around a “platform of authenticity”.</p>
<p class="p1">Other highlights of our conversation include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">The effort Casey puts into each video he creates</li>
<li class="li1">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxfZkMm3wcg&feature=youtu.be"><span class="s2">Make It Count</span></a> Nike video that created a sensation</li>
<li class="li1">His process for what he decides to develop</li>
<li class="li1">How persistence is critical to anyone trying to achieve success in his field</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Casey says what he does takes hard work and he paves his own way. He explains that in his process, he is beholden only to himself and his voice, and it's an incredibly liberating way to be.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The infamous Miami-based rap group 2 Live Crew caused quite a stir in the early 90s when its provocative lyrics and album covers caught the attention of Tipper Gore and the like.</p>
<p class="p1">Luther Campbell (once Luke Skywalker) of 2 Live, drove out of his way to talk with me about what it's like to work against the politicians and the money-making machine of the music industry.</p>
<p class="p1">His new book – <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062336401/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creat"><span class="s1"><em>The Book of Luke: My Fight for Truth, Justice, and Liberty City</em></span></a> – drops on Tuesday (August 4), and he offers a few tips for us who are trying to change the game and re-invent the way we do business.</p>
<p class="p1">Luke calls me an innovative individual, but I am sincerely inspired by his ability to constantly stand out and re-invent himself. "I try to be a trendsetter," he says. "I never liked being a follower."</p>
<p class="p1">Take his new book, for example. It's not necessarily a fashionable thing for hip-hop artists to write and release books, but Luke wants to break down barriers and start a new conversation. In these pages he covers what it was like to be coming up on the scene in Miami and how he changed the game for the better.</p>
<p class="p1">It wasn't his original plan, but it's funny how things work out the way they're supposed to.</p>
<p class="p1">"I wanted to be a promoter," Luke says of his first career move. As a DJ in Miami, it was his job to play new tracks and bring in unknown artists to perform.</p>
<p class="p1">Finding labels for these artists was impossible. Without any labels in the South willing to sign, Luke created his own. He took his creative energy and his business smarts to help these artists sell their skills and see their success top the charts. But with this success came a bit of backlash from women's groups, politicians, and even fellow artists who did not respect his knack for sampling and reworking songs, film, and television into explosively sexy dance tracks.</p>
<p class="p1">That was all part of the game, though, and Luke was conscious of every business decision he made. His technique?</p>
<p class="p1">"I would plan my album releases alongside bigger album releases so people would see it in the store. My album covers would hook you in."</p>
<p class="p1">Tricks like this can lead you to success, but you have to be prepared for any criticism that comes your way – even one in the form of a lawsuit.</p>
<p class="p1">What Luke learned from his experience can apply to all of us who are struggling to start and succeed at our own business ventures.</p>
<p class="p1">I've noticed that successful people always have someone coming after them, and not necessarily in a good way. "We live in a world where all you have to do is get people to complain, then they'll target you," Luke says.</p>
<p class="p1">So how do you counteract this target?</p>
<p class="p1">Keep fighting...</p>
<p class="p1">That's why he put fight in the book title. "It is hard to beat the machine," he says. "But you can put some dents in it, and you can make people think. You can fight against the machine... [and] put the pressure on the machine to change."</p>
<p class="p1">Luther Campbell's experience through the ins and outs and ups and downs of the music industry is cataloged in his new book, and the way he performs under pressure is inspiring. What you can take away from this interview and his book is how important it is not to take orders from anyone but yourself. As you explore your own business techniques, remember Luke's words: "Never stand down for anything."</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Rath</span> knows the secret to happiness. On today's show, I talk with him about his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1939714036/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1939714036&l"><span class="s1"><em>Are You Fully Charged?</em></span></a><span class="s2">,</span> and with it, he offers key insights into finding the happiness and passion you need to feel fulfilled in your work and in your daily life.</p>
<p class="p1">With over 5 million copies of his books sold worldwide, Tom knows what inspires you and what hinders you. He also knows what you can do to overcome your own personal weaknesses to build a better and stronger business within yourself.</p>
<p class="p1">I had some specific questions to discuss with him during this show, and his practical answers and optimistic perspective will definitely kick start your quest for meaning in your life.</p>
<p class="p1">When it comes to finding meaning, the best place to start is a book. "I read a lot of books out there, especially in the business field," Tom says.</p>
<p class="p1">He recommends taking the information you find in books and applying it to your day-to-day business in order to stay grounded in the goals that matter.</p>
<p class="p1">By breaking down your goals into daily, achievable objectives rather than wide-ranging, extensive ideas, you are more likely to succeed and to learn more regarding your success.</p>
<p class="p1">And when you take charge of your own learning in this way, you take charge of your own motivation, which is the most powerful tool in your arsenal when it comes to achieving happiness.</p>
<p class="p1">Ultimately, Tom wants us to start living every day like we have to do something that will leave an impression long after we're gone.</p>
<p class="p1">In order to do this, we have to continue to seek new ways to be motivated.</p>
<p class="p1">Motivation and happiness go hand in hand, and that's Tom's secret. He shares more on his secret to happiness with me today, including:</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">•</span>How to seek out ways to inspire fellow business partners, friends, and family</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">•</span>How to seek out groups and peers that will continue to motivate you</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">•</span>How to find a healthy balance between luck and talent that leads to success</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">•</span>How to cover and hone your natural talents, whatever they may be</p>
<p class="p1">The last point is the topic we spend the most time discussing.</p>
<p class="p1">If you are worried that you have no unique talents, squash that fear immediately. "There is something you can do better than anyone else in the world," Tom states, and if you focus on grooming that talent, even in your spare time, you will find yourself much happier.</p>
<p class="p1">Tom Rath's points from his new book, <em>Are You Fully Charged?,</em> will help you recognize these talents and motivation in yourself, which in turn will help you find meaning in your work and in your life.</p>

<p class="p1">Tom Rath's points from his new book, <em>Are You Fully Charged?,</em> will help you recognize these talents and motivation in yourself, which in turn will help you find meaning in your work and in your life.</p>

			<title>Ep. 122 - Oliver Burkeman: The Positive Power of Negative Thinking</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">My guest today, author <a href="http://www.oliverburkeman.com/"><span class="s1">Oliver Burkeman</span></a>, has a strong opinion on the power of positive thinking: he can't stand it.</p>
<p class="p1">In his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1480527300/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1480527300&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s2"><em>The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking</em></span></a>,Oliver writes in a humorous and thoughtful way about how self-help books are ineffective.</p>
<p class="p2">Oliver believes we should coexist with both our positive and negative thoughts, be attached to neither, and take the actions we need to take without giving into emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">His approach is partly Stoic: he believes that telling people that everything will work out doesn't replenish their optimism tanks. He also believes it can be paralyzing for people to think that whatever success they are seeking must be realized.</p>
<p class="p1">We talk a bit in-depth about one of Oliver's favorite quotes from Shoma Morita:</p>
<p class="p1">"Give up on yourself. Begin taking action now, while being neurotic or imperfect, or a procrastinator or unhealthy or lazy or any other label by which you inaccurately describe yourself. Go ahead and be the best imperfect person you can be and get started on those things you want to accomplish before you die."</p>
<p class="p1">Oliver and I discuss some of the books we enjoy like: <em>Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway </em>by Susan Jeffers, <em>The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment</em> byEckhart Tolle, and <em>The Art of Taking Action </em>by GreggKrech, among others.</p>
<p class="p1">We also take a look at the self-help books we don't find helpful.</p>
<p class="p1">Oliver's book is an insightful and creative look at the negativity of positive thinking.</p>

<p class="p3">In November 2011, he released a video on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube%22%20%5Co%20%22YouTube"><span class="s3">YouTube</span></a> of him rapping over the beat to "<span class="s4">Look at Me Now" </span>while he prepared pancakes in his kitchen.</p>
<p class="p3">The video became a viral hit and got millions of views in a matter of days, but he'd been practicing his craft for years and years.</p>
<p class="p3">As he tells James on the extended version of Ask Altucher, high school bored him so he started writing rap songs in study hall.</p>
<p class="p3">Rapping wasn't his passion, but it worked. As he became better at it he became much more passionate...</p>
<p class="p3">By 2011 he'd finally made it. Today he often spends hours listening to rappers and learning from them.</p>
<p class="p3">He tells James that he believes it takes 20 years to become a real master at your trade.</p>
<p class="p3">It takes you a couple of years to move past a beginner, and by year five you start to find your voice and stop mimicking others.</p>
<p class="p3">By year 15 you finally focus and become an authentic voice.</p>
<p class="p1">But he didn't stop there. He's written a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476706875/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1476706875&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1">Texts From Bennett</span></a> that was optioned by FX.</p>
<p class="p1">Most things you try probably won't work, but keep trying and eventually one good idea will slip through... And no one will remember your prior mistakes.</p>
<p class="p1">This is a great interview and you'll want listen to the entire conversation.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">A lot of people call <a href="http://jimkwik.com/"><span class="s1">Jim Kwik</span></a> a brain expert. On today's show, he gives us a sneak peek into his seminars that teach people how to optimize their brains to be more productive and powerful every day.</p>
<p class="p1">"With great power comes great responsibility." Jim reverses the iconic saying to put normal people in control of their own accelerated learning: With great responsibility comes great power. </p>
<p class="p1">When you take control of your own learning techniques, you are capable of great things.</p>
<p class="p1">What if you were born with superpowers but nobody showed you how to use them? You may not feel like you can excel at accelerated learning, but that does not mean you aren't capable.</p>
<p class="p1">Jim reveals that even he experienced learning difficulties as a child after an accidental fall when he was in kindergarten.</p>
<p class="p1">"It took me two years longer to learn how to read," he says, and because of these difficulties, he was able to find new ways to learn and excel.</p>
<p class="p1">Your brain never stops learning.</p>
<p class="p1">You may have been told that your memory is fixed, like your shoe size, but that is not the case. Learning new things creates more brain cells and will help you live a longer life.</p>
<p class="p1">But how can you continue to learn new things? Jim breaks down a few of his techniques and key anecdotal lessons, including:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to distance yourself from your own self-talk and break the trance of "I can't."</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to ask new and exciting questions in order to learn new things.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to take an active approach to learning in order to get the most out of your experiences.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to incorporate EFT, or emotional freedom techniques, into your learning style.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to improve memory through the location method.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Jim takes the time to share a few of his tricks and techniques for boosting charisma to improve your memory and conquer your fears of public speaking.</p>
<p class="p1">He reminds us to be present in the moment in order to find the motivation we need. This will also help us remember the new information and recall it from memory just as easily.</p>
<p class="p1">Unleash your cape...</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Brett McKay is the founder of <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/"><span class="s1">The Art of Manliness</span></a>, a website dedicated to delivering inspiring, actionable, and life changing advice to both men and women. A lot of times men just need a little more help being organized and getting their lives together than women do. As James says, "Women just grow up faster."</p>
<p class="p1">Brett's wife Kate is also his business partner. While there are many advantages to having your spouse involved with your business, it also introduces the difficulty of separating work time from personal time. Even during dedicated work time it sometimes is hard to clearly define roles and responsibilities in the business. This is a theme that spans most business relationships, but generally your business partner isn't also the person you share a bed with each night.</p>
<p class="p1">Brett keeps it simple by living by the mantra that both you and your spouse should "Seek to Serve Each Other." This doesn't need to be an equal relationship all the time. Go out of your way to be generous and giving to your loved ones.</p>
<p class="p1">The Art of Manliness is currently publishing blog posts, podcast episodes, and videos about how to live well as a man in the modern world. As opposed to many of the existing Men's publications, The Art of Manliness is geared toward slightly older, professional men, and isn't focused on how to have six-pack abs or toe-curling sex for 5 hours every day. There are professional tips, parenting tips for men, and what some may call "Old Fashioned" advice that men can take to live a better, more fulfilling life.</p>
<p class="p1">The site is currently experiencing revenues in the high six-figures-per-year range, and has been publishing consistently this entire time. As James has recounted before, it often takes 4 or 5 years to change your life, "Choose Yourself," and create the reality that you want.</p>
<p class="p1">Brett gives advice on how to grow a site like he has with today's social media and sharing tools. He is a big advocate of "Guest Posting" on other blogs as a way to increase your reach online. The age of the solo blog is slowly going away. Today, sites like The Art of Manliness, with guest contributors, allow for a diverse set of voices and perspectives that one single person could never give. To make it easier on the site you're looking to guest post on, do most of the work for them. This includes image formatting, sizing, tagging, and including a scope of what type of post you would like to submit for that site.</p>
<p class="p1">Digging into some of the more popular posts on the site, James and Brett discuss a few key topics:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Regarding <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/07/31/the-problem-with-minimalism/"><span class="s1">Minimalism</span></a>, Brett and James discuss how trying to be minimalist often leads to an obsession with the things you do have. Instead of just focusing on having things, even if it's fewer things, both advocate spending your time and money on experiences. This has been scientifically proven to increase happiness and is a great way to parent, as well as live your life if you don't have children.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>The concept of Antifragility applies not only to the financial markets, as originally described by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Disorder-Incerto/dp/0812979680"><span class="s1">Nasim Taleb</span></a>, but also to many aspects of everyday life. Health, fitness, engineering, women's health and vitality, and even society in general all experience aspects of Antifragility. We can all do things today to increase our Antifragility and be less susceptible to the trials of life. The <a href="http://www"><span class="s1">redundancies in our lives</span></a> can also increase Antifragility.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>The Art of Manliness closely mirrors a lot of the topics that James has written about time and time again, including Integrity. Until very recently the term Manliness meant not only physical strength but to be a man of <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/category/the-virtuous-life/"><span class="s1">virtue</span></a>. This theme holds true through all of Brett's website, and is helping to bring back a better way of life for men.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Bringing back some of the older-style manly characteristics includes being decisive and leading in relationships. Gender roles can often get complicated by stereotypes and social norms but the fact remains that in most relationships there needs to be a leader. And many times modern women are looking for the men in their lives to be that leader.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">In parting, the one piece of information that Brett thinks that women need to know about men is that most men are very attuned to status. How people perceive men is something very important to many, regardless of what they may say.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Surrendering to what the universe has put in front of you, being able to set aside fears, and living in the moment sounds like an awesome way to go through life.</p>
<p class="p1">Today's guest, Michael Singer, has written two books that say it is entirely possible to do that.</p>
<p class="p1">His first book, <em>New York Times</em> No. 1 bestseller <em>The Untethered Soul</em>, was released in 2007. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1572245379/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1572245379&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>The Untethered Soul</em></span></a>, Michael explained ways to find inner peace. He also found himself on the other end of a phone call from Oprah, who loved the book and wanted to interview him on her show.</p>
<p class="p1">He never thought of giving an interview.</p>
<p class="p1">He made it a point not to.</p>
<p class="p1">When <em>The Untethered Soul</em> came out, he paid for marketing but said he would not do interviews... That is, until Oprah called him directly.</p>
<p class="p1">They talked on the phone for 45 minutes and he went to Chicago. That was his first and only "in-person" interview.</p>
<p class="p1">The "second in-person interview" was... You guessed it, the one with Claudia and me, "because there was something there."</p>
<p class="p1">Claudia and I  both e-mailed separately and a bunch of coincidences made our name stand out. One woman who lives on the grounds had read Claudia’s yoga book. Another woman tweeted with me.</p>
<p class="p1">And so here it is.</p>
<p class="p1">Michael just released a second book, <em>The Surrender Experiment</em>, which details his journey following his spiritual awakening as events unfolded in front of him, including running a multibillion-dollar company and finding himself embroiled in a lawsuit.</p>
<p class="p1">Michael, who also goes by the name Mickey, founded the Temple of the Universe in Florida in 1975. It's a nonprofit organization established as a yoga and meditation center where, according to the site, people of any religion or set of beliefs can come together to experience the inner peace Michael talks about.</p>
<p class="p1">The Temple of the Universe is where Claudia and I caught up with him.</p>
<p class="p1">On the day of the interview, Michael took us to all the sites he mentions in the book.</p>
<p class="p1">He took us to his house, which came to him when God called on the phone (an amazing story in the book). It has a meditation pyramid on the third level. I kid you not.</p>
<p class="p1">It was the first house built on the property with all glass on the front... It was where he was staying when the guy dressed in Egyptian clothes (a story that is not in the book but is on the podcast) helped him grow by bothering him.</p>
<p class="p1">He took us to the temple, of course, where we sang devotional songs ranging from the Gayatri Mantra to a Hebrew devotional song to the Our Father prayer to the Gita... and on and on...</p>
<p class="p1">He also showed us the huge  five-building office space that "him getting out of the way" co-created while he was a CEO. It's a <a href="http://www.tou.org/"><span class="s1">beautiful place</span></a> of which he calls himself "the groundskeeper."</p>
<p class="p1">In the interview, we talked with Michael about his books, the inner awakening he experienced, and how it has affected him personally and professionally. He explained how we can all achieve a similar state of being. He broke down some of the ways to do that, including:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Quieting the noise in our heads, which keeps us from achieving a high level of awareness</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How fear affects us</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Allowing events to unfold and how to deal with them as they do</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Letting go of personal preference</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>How to live harmoniously rather than in a state of mental chaos</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Michael stated that it's important to relax and be in the moment and that our inner state is meant to be healthy. He said we need to surrender to the unfolding of the universe, and by doing so, we will flourish and life will become phenomenal.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080414110X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=080414110X&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>The Surrender Experiment</em></a></span> is Michael's journey as he applies it to his life and the results he found from living in a state of surrender to the universe.</p>

<li class="li1">•Quieting the noise in our heads, which keeps us from achieving a high level of awareness</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">•How fear affects us</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">•Allowing events to unfold and how to deal with them as they do</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">•Letting go of personal preference</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">•How to live harmoniously rather than in a state of mental chaos</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">Michael stated that it's important to relax and be in the moment and that our inner state is meant to be healthy. He said we need to surrender to the unfolding of the universe, and by doing so, we will flourish and life will become phenomenal.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Hal Elrod was dead for six minutes. The car he was driving crashed head on into a truck. His girlfriend, sitting next to him, was unscratched.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The roof of the car sliced open his head, causing brain damage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bones in his face, his arm, all over his body were broken and he was in a coma for six days (during which time his girlfriend broke up with him). When he woke from his coma the doctors told him he might never walk again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are the alchemist of your life. The universe, perfect for 14 billion years, has given you everything you need to thrive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And yet...we often want to forcibly change the universe to fit our own selfish needs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What idiots!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sure Hal did not want to hit that car. Did not want to be told he might not walk again. Did not want to go through years of therapy and misfortune as a result of this single event.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is where alchemy comes in. We're all given this chance at some point in our lives. We're all given the tools to turn misfortune into gold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">15 years later Hal is a father, runs a successful business, and is a bestselling author of the book "The Miracle Morning". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why I love to podcast is because I can just call Hal up and say "Can I talk to you about this book?" So I did on "Ask Altucher" a few weeks ago. What a great scam podcasting is!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The universe is a contradiction. It is infinitely open and yet we can't escape it. It is 99.9999% empty and yet is filled with everything. Atoms bounce around totally randomly and yet defined by the most precise equations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Einstein said "God doesn't roll dice" and yet...every moment is unpredictable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We'll never understand the contradiction and we shouldn't try. Trying has led to myths, to misconceptions, to wars, to anguish </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hal didn't fight what the universe had dealt him. He turned the fear and the pain and crushed it down into a diamond.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The diamond he now calls his "miracle morning" routine that he put together bit by bit to save his life. And now by he uses that same routine to save the lives of thousands of others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I like his routine because it fits perfectly into what I call "The daily practice" of choosing yourself: striving to improve every day 1% across physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After I spoke to Hal I put together this infographic describing his method.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Different parts of our brain are activated when we read facts as opposed to when we read poetry. Because facts we try to remember... and poetry we try to unravel a mystery of words mixed with art.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We're so ignorant and lonely and overwhelmed by this vastness - this story that tells everything but reveals nothing. And yet we're all in it together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What if every moment we turned the facts of our lives into poetry. To give up trying to assign meaning and turn all of our periods into question marks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Doing these daily practices, or miracle morning routines, is how we begin to unravel that mystery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe this one thing is the only thing I really believe in. The rest...I'm wide-eyed and just born and want to learn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My grandfather used to say to me when I was little, "if the universe had an end, what's on the other side?" He'd keep repeating it, because we both were trying to figure it out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My brain hurt trying to think about it. Because there's no answer but it begs for one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I've never died like Hal. Maybe it's irrational but I'm kind of jealous of that he did. People who die have a story for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This morning I'm going to get ready to die. And this morning that's how I'm going to live.</p>]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">Hal Elrod was dead for six minutes. The car he was driving crashed head on into a truck. His girlfriend, sitting next to him, was unscratched.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The roof of the car sliced open his head, causing brain damage.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bones in his face, his arm, all over his body were broken and he was in a coma for six days (during which time his girlfriend broke up with him). When he woke from his coma the doctors told him he might never walk again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You are the alchemist of your life. The universe, perfect for 14 billion years, has given you everything you need to thrive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And yet...we often want to forcibly change the universe to fit our own selfish needs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What idiots!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sure Hal did not want to hit that car. Did not want to be told he might not walk again. Did not want to go through years of therapy and misfortune as a result of this single event.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This is where alchemy comes in. We're all given this chance at some point in our lives. We're all given the tools to turn misfortune into gold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">15 years later Hal is a father, runs a successful business, and is a bestselling author of the book "The Miracle Morning". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Why I love to podcast is because I can just call Hal up and say "Can I talk to you about this book?" So I did on "Ask Altucher" a few weeks ago. What a great scam podcasting is!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The universe is a contradiction. It is infinitely open and yet we can't escape it. It is 99.9999% empty and yet is filled with everything. Atoms bounce around totally randomly and yet defined by the most precise equations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Einstein said "God doesn't roll dice" and yet...every moment is unpredictable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We'll never understand the contradiction and we shouldn't try. Trying has led to myths, to misconceptions, to wars, to anguish </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hal didn't fight what the universe had dealt him. He turned the fear and the pain and crushed it down into a diamond.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The diamond he now calls his "miracle morning" routine that he put together bit by bit to save his life. And now by he uses that same routine to save the lives of thousands of others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I like his routine because it fits perfectly into what I call "The daily practice" of choosing yourself: striving to improve every day 1% across physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After I spoke to Hal I put together this infographic describing his method.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Different parts of our brain are activated when we read facts as opposed to when we read poetry. Because facts we try to remember... and poetry we try to unravel a mystery of words mixed with art.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We're so ignorant and lonely and overwhelmed by this vastness - this story that tells everything but reveals nothing. And yet we're all in it together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What if every moment we turned the facts of our lives into poetry. To give up trying to assign meaning and turn all of our periods into question marks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Doing these daily practices, or miracle morning routines, is how we begin to unravel that mystery.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe this one thing is the only thing I really believe in. The rest...I'm wide-eyed and just born and want to learn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My grandfather used to say to me when I was little, "if the universe had an end, what's on the other side?" He'd keep repeating it, because we both were trying to figure it out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My brain hurt trying to think about it. Because there's no answer but it begs for one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I've never died like Hal. Maybe it's irrational but I'm kind of jealous of that he did. People who die have a story for the rest of their lives.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you want to see into the future, and live longer, healthier and happier then you must tune into today's podcast.</p>
<p class="p1">It may scare the hell out of you but there is no holding it back.</p>
<p class="p1">The future is here and you can't get out of its way.</p>
<p class="p1">Steven Kotler, the best-selling author, journalist and entrepreneur joins James for today's show.</p>
<p class="p1">Steven's books include <em>Abundance</em>, <em>The Rise of Superman</em>, <em>Bold</em>, and his newest release, <span class="s1"><em>Tomorrowland</em></span><em>: Our Journey from Science Fiction to Science Fact</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Tomorrowland</em> offers an optimistic look into the future, but at the same time it is a bit scary.</p>
<p class="p1">With an introduction of, "The future is here," Steven's book outlines the rapid pace that technology is and will continue to define us in every way imaginable.</p>
<p class="p1">Some of the highlights from the book include:</p>
<p class="p2">Strap-on bionics that reverse the aging trend and put force back into our bodies.</p>
<p class="p1">Extending life using stem cells to swap out old body parts for new ones.</p>
<p class="p1">Artificial vision that restores what was lost.</p>
<p class="p1">With all these advancements, questions are raised. Steven asks how these things will affect religion and our thoughts about theoretical mortality in the face of technological immortality.</p>
<p class="p1">They discuss having the ability to move our short-term memories to a place in the brain where long-term memories are stored. On the scary side of this is synthetic biology where customizable diseases  can target a specific person without them knowing.</p>
<p class="p1">Criminals could potentially exploit this but the use of microsensors could be a way to fight back.</p>
<p class="p1">Steven believes the greatest opportunities are in virtual reality, a field that  will be exploding in three to five years.</p>
<p class="p1">He thinks even our jobs will move into the virtual world and we will be spending more and more time there.</p>
<p class="p1">According to Steven, internet-sized opportunities exist in this because:</p>
<p class="p1">Technology is progressing at a rapid rate.</p>
<p class="p1">Economic possibilities have been proven.</p>
<p class="p2">Deeply meaningful experiences can be created.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today I'm very pleased to welcome <a href="http://www.finishrich.com/"><span class="s1">David Bach</span></a> to the show. David is the author of several books on achieving your financial goals, and doing so while reducing stress along the way. With titles including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/David-Bach/e/"><span class="s1"><em>Automatic Millionaire</em>, <em>Smart Women Finish Rich</em>, and <em>Smart Couples Finish Rich</em></span></a>, David has become an absolute authority on choosing yourself first. Or as he says, "Pay yourself first."</p>
<p class="p1">With financial troubles being the leading cause of friction and divorce amongst couples, David has found several key ways that families can manage their finances easier. Steps couples can take to improve their financial lives include:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Talking about small purchases more often.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Twice a year, work with your spouse or a financial advisor to monitor your personal financial statement.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Have a vision for your financial future. This clarifies every decision you make in your financial life.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">David is a big advocate of "The Latte Factor" and doing small things to save money every day. This helps people overcome the biggest obstacle to better financial behaviors: getting started.</p>
<p class="p1">Whether you're an entrepreneur or an intrapreneur, the thing you can do that will have the most effect on your financial path is to increase your income. For entrepreneurs, this means increasing your rates. If your services are indispensable to current customers, they will gladly pay a higher rate. If you're working within a company, getting a raise on a regular basis is the way to go. Be valuable to your employer and they will gladly reward you.</p>
<p class="p1">The digital economy and the passing recession have given us a unique opportunity to reinvent ourselves. While many people are having to do this at an older age, David has a few key actions people can take to get on this road, even if it's later in life:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>Spend Less.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you're into hunting for buried pirate treasure then this is the show for you. Today I'm very happy to welcome bestselling author Robert Kurson to the podcast.</p>
<p class="p1">Robert has just released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/14000"><span class="s1"><em>Pirate Hunters: Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship</em></span></a>. This is the second book featuring John Chatterton and is about his quest with John Mattera to find the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. Bannister, a gentleman and business owner working with shipping companies in the Caribbean, one day turned pirate and stole a boat named The Golden Fleece, setting off on a pirate's adventure for years.</p>
<p class="p1">Treasure hunting may seem like a romantic,  childish notion, but most treasure hunters are often seeking adventure, encountering huge adversity in their search and often risking all to solve the mysteries they encounter beneath the water. Chatterton (a police officer) and Mattera (a commercial diver) worked all week, used their savings, and spent every free minute of their time searching for this long lost ship.</p>

<p class="p1">Robert learned the lesson of storytelling early on. Growing up he was regularly brought out of school, sometimes for extended periods of time, to travel the country.

<p class="p1">Robert and James agree that a good barometer of your happiness in a job is how you view the people you work with. If you enjoy the people you're working with then you can be happy at your job. If you don't enjoy being around attorneys, for example, then there's virtually no chance you'll be happy at work every day as an attorney.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If you're into hunting for buried pirate treasure then this is the show for you. Today I'm very happy to welcome bestselling author Robert Kurson to the podcast.</p>
<p class="p1">Robert has just released <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/14000"><em>Pirate Hunters: Treasure, Obsession, and the Search for a Legendary Pirate Ship</em></a>. This is the second book featuring John Chatterton and is about his quest with John Mattera to find the ship of the infamous pirate Joseph Bannister. Bannister, a gentleman and business owner working with shipping companies in the Caribbean, one day turned pirate and stole a boat named The Golden Fleece, setting off on a pirate's adventure for years.</p>
<p class="p1">Treasure hunting may seem like a romantic,  childish notion, but most treasure hunters are often seeking adventure, encountering huge adversity in their search and often risking all to solve the mysteries they encounter beneath the water. Chatterton (a police officer) and Mattera (a commercial diver) worked all week, used their savings, and spent every free minute of their time searching for this long lost ship.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0739320831/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0739320831&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>Shadow Divers</em></a>was Robert's first book featuring Richie Kohler and John Chatterton on their quest to solve the mystery of a WWII German U-boat found off the New Jersey coast in 1991 and how the questions surrounding this discovery would haunt these men, their marriages, and ultimately challenge every aspect of their lives.</p>

			<title>Ep. 115 - Rick Ross: How to Manage Your Employees When They're All Carrying Guns</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">"I'm the kind of person who is embarrassed to lie," says "Freeway" Rick Ross. Not the words you would expect to come from a convicted felon.</p>
<p class="p3">Rick built an empire, a drug empire that is, the notorious Los Angeles crack-cocaine empire.</p>
<p class="p3">But the man who built this empire is not an evil man as you might suspect. He is charitable, a teacher, and an ideal leader. "I always knew I was going to jail," he tells me.</p>
<p class="p3">So why did I interview him?</p>
<p class="p3">First off, his story is the kind that creates curiosity. It is so foreign to me – a good, Jewish boy. It's thrilling.</p>
<p class="p3">Second, our stories have a common theme: How do you pick yourself up when you're at rock bottom?</p>
<p class="p3">His rock bottom was finding out he was sentenced to life in prison. How do you stay motivated after discovering your entire future will be in a cage? How do you not run away? Can you "choose yourself" here?</p>
<p class="p3">Yes.</p>
<p class="p4">Before bottom, Rick was illiterate. He picked himself up by <a href="https://www.stansberryradio.com/Frank-Curzio/Latest-Episodes/Episode/927/AA-Ep-226-How-to-Improve-1-per-Day-Every-Day"><span class="s2">improving every day</span></a>. He read 300 books, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and more all before he was granted bail.</p>
<p class="p4">He was given a sentence, but he changed his destiny. You can, too.</p>
<p class="p4">Rick also has expert advice on how to resolve conflicts. In his business, he had power and guns but chose peace over force time and time again. His story is a good example of how to build loyalty. You can use his experience to create loyal teams and partnerships in your life and work, too.</p>
<p class="p4">The moral of the story here is not how you find success. It's what you do with it that matters. During his rise to the top, Rick gave back to his community. He gives back today by advocating literacy and speaking in schools.</p>
<p class="p4">After listening, you could write a <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/05/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-"><span class="s2">"10 ideas" list</span></a> on how you can give back to your community today.

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Neil Strauss and James never had met before this interview but you'd think they've been best friends forever.</p>
<p class="p1">And that's why Neil has been so successful writing about the undercover world of pickup artists.</p>
<p class="p1">He's a really nice guy.</p>
<p class="p1">They dive right into some of the techniques that Neil talks about in his best-seller, <em>The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists,</em> and he asks James to let his listeners "know him."</p>
<p class="p1">So James becomes the patient today and Neil does a quick analysis.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of what Neil talks about is how you can get out of you comfort zone.</p>
<p class="p1">Too often people fake it… but to honestly get out, you may need a friend to push you way out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p class="p1">James asks Neil what's next and Neil tells him...</p>
<p class="p2">Don't be trapped in what you've done before.</p>
<p class="p1">"All people know of what you've done from what you've done before. They don't know what you're going to do next."</p>
<p class="p1">Go do you.</p>
<p class="p1">Regards,</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Neil Strauss and James never had met before this interview but you'd think they've been best friends forever.</p>
<p class="p1">And that's why Neil has been so successful writing about the undercover world of pickup artists.</p>
<p class="p1">He's a really nice guy.</p>
<p class="p1">They dive right into some of the techniques that Neil talks about in his best-seller, <em>The Game: Penetrating the Secret Society of Pickup Artists,</em> and he asks James to let his listeners "know him."</p>
<p class="p1">So James becomes the patient today and Neil does a quick analysis.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of what Neil talks about is how you can get out of you comfort zone.</p>
<p class="p1">Too often people fake it… but to honestly get out, you may need a friend to push you way out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p class="p1">James asks Neil what's next and Neil tells him...</p>
<p class="p2">Don't be trapped in what you've done before.</p>
<p class="p1">"All people know of what you've done from what you've done before. They don't know what you're going to do next."</p>
<p class="p1">Go do you.</p>
<p class="p1">Regards,</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I think I'm in love with Mimi Ikonn. Oh, and also her husband Alex Ikonn. Don't want to confuse anyone!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">When I was a kid I didn't think I would be happy unless I was a "millionaire". Some kids in my school said they were millionaires and they would make fun of anyone who wasn't.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I asked my dad what he was worth. He said $2. Maybe that scarred me so much that I always make sure to have wads of $2 bills on me at all times.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">A year or so later his company went bankrupt. So he wasn't worth the same anymore. In his mind, he was worth ZERO.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">For the rest of his life he sat in the living room, depressed, and listened to music. When he was a little boy he loved music and won an award.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">At some point we all return to what we loved as a child. I suppose that means I will return to comics, Judy Blume, and spying on people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">A few weeks ago I met Mimi Ikonn and Alex Ikonn. I was insanely curious about them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">How come? Because Mimi makes videos of herself, delivers real value to people, and then makes over a million a year because of those videos.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I don't know how old Mimi is. She's much younger than me. She's much younger than my father ever was when I was alive. He would've liked to live her life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">So Claudia and I asked Mimi and Alex if we could interview them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Because they seemed very happy also. The podcast comes out later today but here's the summary.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">This is a simple post. How to make a million.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I am absolutely sure the same techniques that worked for Mimi and Alex can work for anyone. I had them lay it out step by step.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">A) EMOTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi became obsessed with beauty and hair. She and Alex watched before and after videos of women who were getting hair extensions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">"They seemed much happier after getting extensions," Alex said. "Whenever there are strong emotions about something you know there is an opportunity."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">So Mimi started making videos of herself discussing hair and beauty and hair products.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">"I never thought I would get more than 1,000 views," Mimi said. "But I loved doing the videos. And I wanted to share my love for the topics with as many people as possible."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Now she has had a quarter of a BILLION views on her videos with 2.7 million subscribers.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">B) HUB AND SPOKE</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">People ask: "How do I get traffic to my blog". Or "how do I get buyers of my book." or "How do I get people to follow me on Twitter."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">A lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish. We want family to love them. We want friends to love them. And then we want the world to love them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I'm really just talking about myself. I know when people enjoy things I do, I feel as if I have a family. I'm happy. At least until the next post.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi loved making the videos but needed traffic.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">So they did the only two-step technique that gets traffic online for anything you want to do. Well, make it a three-step technique.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">1) Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Know more, love more, express more, bleed more, than anyone else. Was Mimi the only one doing videos on beauty and hair? No. But maybe she put more passion into it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">2) Spread the Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Alex would take images and posts and links to her videos and spread them on Pinterest, Instagram, blogs, other sites and have them all point back to her YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I call this "the Hub and Spoke" approach. Youtube was the hub, with a dozen or so spokes reaching out to popular sites that all would link back to the hub.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">3) Make more Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">No matter what you do - some will be good and some will be bad. Not every video or post is going to have views. So you do more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">When you do more, several things happen:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">a. More people find you</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">b. You rank higher on search</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">c. You improve</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">d. People who find you start clicking on your older videos so now they start to get more views.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">The "Make More Love" technique always works.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Michelle Phan did 54 YouTube videos before she made a massive hit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Hugh Howey had already ten novels before he published "Wool" which became a massive bestseller. Clayton Christiansen applied for NASA for 18 years in a row before they accepted him.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Make more love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">C) 1000 PEOPLE</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Note she said she only thought she was going to get 1000 viewers. The number 1000 keeps coming up with people who have HUGE audiences.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Kevin Kelly wrote about this in a great post called "1000 True Fans". He writes about it kk.org. He also talks about it on my podcast.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Tim Ferriss talks about how every one of his posts he makes sure he's going to deliver value to at least 1000 people.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Of course he delivers much more value than that. But 1000 seems to be the right number that people who know seem to focus on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Keep focusing on delivering value for a 1000 and then they tell 2 friends and so on and next thing you know you have a quarter of a billion views, five bestsellers, movies being made about you, you go into space, your own makeup lines, and on and on and on, depending on what it is you love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">D) BUY LOW, SELL HIGH</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Alex and Mimi noticed that many of the other beauty videos were talking about a specific brand of hair extensions for women. So they went to my favorite place in the world - the mall.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">"We saw these products were priced at $500," Alex said. "So then we went on Ali Baba and saw the same products being sold for $100. We then went to the manufacturers and saw we could buy directly for $50. The exact same products that were being sold for $500."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">They borrowed from mom. Borrowed their full amount off of their credit cards. And they placed an order. Then, I imagine (they did not tell me this) they prayed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">E) SOFT SELL</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi talks about many products on her videos. She expressed a radiant, confident personality and talks about everything she is wearing, what her habits are, what products she uses. She NEVER sells anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">But underneath the video is just a link. www.luxyhair.com.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">The orders came in one at a time. Then 100 at a time. They sold out of their inventory, paid everyone back, and bought more.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">In their very first year (2010) they had over a million in revenues. Ever since then they've had more than a million a year in profits. Never once using the words "buy this" anywhere.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">F) QVC-A</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">The most successful people have a model for their success. I think that's why I enjoy Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" book so much. Or Peter Diamandis's "Bold". Or Marcus Lemonis's TV show "The Profit".</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Each book has a different, but very very simple, model for how to achieve success or how to judge which companies are successful.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi and Alex developed their own model, they stick with it, and have used this simple model to keep jumping from success to success.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Alex explained it to me:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Q - Quality</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Everything they do is quality. The cameras they use for videos ("But not overdoing it, because this is YouTube and not television," said Mimi). The setting they use and how it fits their message.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">The products, etc</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">V - Value</span></strong></p>

She explains what she does and how she does it. She does the research and believes in the products. Rather than asking, she is giving.</span></p>

He was Mary Tyler Moore's husband, ran NBC for awhile, and then ran MTM productions producing such shows as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", "Bon Newhart", and a dozen other super hit TV shows.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">I only remember one thing in the book.</span></p>

If you moved a show from Tuesday at 8pm to Thursday at 8:30pm then you just lost your whole audience."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi said, "if you are going to put out a video once a week, put it out once a week. Put it out the same day each week if you can. Don't do once a month. Don't do random. Your audience starts to anticipate and look forward to your shows and knows when to expect them."</span></p>

There's no fluff. There's no pitch. She's exuberant and it shows on each video.</span></p>

They had the money in the bank. They had achieved their goals. They loved what they were doing but when you hit a lifelong goal you start to ask, "is that it?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">They got depressed.</span></p>

Our ancestors for 200,000 years didn't have goals. Every day started from scratch: hunt, forage, eat, sex, sleep, wake up to a new day.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Then we were told to find our "goals". And now everyone asks, "I'm 17 years old and feel like I've accomplished nothing in life. What should I do?"</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Learning to find happiness with less is true wealth. Claudia and I recently got rid of most of our belongings, for instance. Then we started cancelling most meetings that I had set up. Sometimes it was hard. I had agreed to an event and then I would cancel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Ultimately we are the sum of our experiences and not the sum of our belongings. There is nothing wrong with making money but it is only one small part of living a life of comfort, of compassion, of calm.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">Mimi and Alex started to focus more on the other things that were important in their lives. "And you know what happened?" Alex said. "The more we did that, the more money we made."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Helvetica;">– – –</span></p>

I am always curious how people made money through a channel like YouTube. Now I know and I think it can be replicated by anyone who is willing to do all of the above.</span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I think I'm in love with Mimi Ikonn. Oh, and also her husband Alex Ikonn. Don't want to confuse anyone!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">When I was a kid I didn't think I would be happy unless I was a "millionaire". Some kids in my school said they were millionaires and they would make fun of anyone who wasn't.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I asked my dad what he was worth. He said $2. Maybe that scarred me so much that I always make sure to have wads of $2 bills on me at all times.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">A year or so later his company went bankrupt. So he wasn't worth the same anymore. In his mind, he was worth ZERO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">For the rest of his life he sat in the living room, depressed, and listened to music. When he was a little boy he loved music and won an award.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">At some point we all return to what we loved as a child. I suppose that means I will return to comics, Judy Blume, and spying on people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">A few weeks ago I met Mimi Ikonn and Alex Ikonn. I was insanely curious about them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">How come? Because Mimi makes videos of herself, delivers real value to people, and then makes over a million a year because of those videos.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I don't know how old Mimi is. She's much younger than me. She's much younger than my father ever was when I was alive. He would've liked to live her life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">So Claudia and I asked Mimi and Alex if we could interview them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Because they seemed very happy also. The podcast comes out later today but here's the summary.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This is a simple post. How to make a million.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I am absolutely sure the same techniques that worked for Mimi and Alex can work for anyone. I had them lay it out step by step.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">A) EMOTIONS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi became obsessed with beauty and hair. She and Alex watched before and after videos of women who were getting hair extensions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">"They seemed much happier after getting extensions," Alex said. "Whenever there are strong emotions about something you know there is an opportunity."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">So Mimi started making videos of herself discussing hair and beauty and hair products.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">"I never thought I would get more than 1,000 views," Mimi said. "But I loved doing the videos. And I wanted to share my love for the topics with as many people as possible."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Now she has had a quarter of a BILLION views on her videos with 2.7 million subscribers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">B) HUB AND SPOKE</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">People ask: "How do I get traffic to my blog". Or "how do I get buyers of my book." or "How do I get people to follow me on Twitter."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">A lot of it is about loneliness. We sit in our house writing blog posts and then hit Publish. We want family to love them. We want friends to love them. And then we want the world to love them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I'm really just talking about myself. I know when people enjoy things I do, I feel as if I have a family. I'm happy. At least until the next post.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi loved making the videos but needed traffic.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">So they did the only two-step technique that gets traffic online for anything you want to do. Well, make it a three-step technique.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">1) Love</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Know more, love more, express more, bleed more, than anyone else. Was Mimi the only one doing videos on beauty and hair? No. But maybe she put more passion into it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">2) Spread the Love</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Alex would take images and posts and links to her videos and spread them on Pinterest, Instagram, blogs, other sites and have them all point back to her YouTube channel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I call this "the Hub and Spoke" approach. Youtube was the hub, with a dozen or so spokes reaching out to popular sites that all would link back to the hub.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">3) Make more Love</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">No matter what you do - some will be good and some will be bad. Not every video or post is going to have views. So you do more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">When you do more, several things happen:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">a. More people find you</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">b. You rank higher on search</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">c. You improve</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">d. People who find you start clicking on your older videos so now they start to get more views.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The "Make More Love" technique always works.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Michelle Phan did 54 YouTube videos before she made a massive hit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Hugh Howey had already ten novels before he published "Wool" which became a massive bestseller. Clayton Christiansen applied for NASA for 18 years in a row before they accepted him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Make more love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">C) 1000 PEOPLE</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Note she said she only thought she was going to get 1000 viewers. The number 1000 keeps coming up with people who have HUGE audiences.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Kevin Kelly wrote about this in a great post called "1000 True Fans". He writes about it kk.org. He also talks about it on my podcast.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Tim Ferriss talks about how every one of his posts he makes sure he's going to deliver value to at least 1000 people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Of course he delivers much more value than that. But 1000 seems to be the right number that people who know seem to focus on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Keep focusing on delivering value for a 1000 and then they tell 2 friends and so on and next thing you know you have a quarter of a billion views, five bestsellers, movies being made about you, you go into space, your own makeup lines, and on and on and on, depending on what it is you love.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">D) BUY LOW, SELL HIGH</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Alex and Mimi noticed that many of the other beauty videos were talking about a specific brand of hair extensions for women. So they went to my favorite place in the world - the mall.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">"We saw these products were priced at $500," Alex said. "So then we went on Ali Baba and saw the same products being sold for $100. We then went to the manufacturers and saw we could buy directly for $50. The exact same products that were being sold for $500."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">They borrowed from mom. Borrowed their full amount off of their credit cards. And they placed an order. Then, I imagine (they did not tell me this) they prayed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">E) SOFT SELL</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi talks about many products on her videos. She expressed a radiant, confident personality and talks about everything she is wearing, what her habits are, what products she uses. She NEVER sells anything.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">But underneath the video is just a link. www.luxyhair.com.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The orders came in one at a time. Then 100 at a time. They sold out of their inventory, paid everyone back, and bought more.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">In their very first year (2010) they had over a million in revenues. Ever since then they've had more than a million a year in profits. Never once using the words "buy this" anywhere.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">F) QVC-A</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The most successful people have a model for their success. I think that's why I enjoy Peter Thiel's "Zero to One" book so much. Or Peter Diamandis's "Bold". Or Marcus Lemonis's TV show "The Profit".</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Each book has a different, but very very simple, model for how to achieve success or how to judge which companies are successful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi and Alex developed their own model, they stick with it, and have used this simple model to keep jumping from success to success.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Alex explained it to me:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Q - Quality</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Everything they do is quality. The cameras they use for videos ("But not overdoing it, because this is YouTube and not television," said Mimi). The setting they use and how it fits their message.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The products, etc</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">V - Value</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi is not trying to sell anything in her videos. She explains what she does and how she does it. She does the research and believes in the products. Rather than asking, she is giving.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">"When you give a billion dollars in value," Alex said, "you get a billion dollars or more back."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">C - Consistency</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I read a book about television once by TV mega-executive Grant Tinker. He was Mary Tyler Moore's husband, ran NBC for awhile, and then ran MTM productions producing such shows as "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", "Bon Newhart", and a dozen other super hit TV shows.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I only remember one thing in the book.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">He said, "whenever they changed the time or date of a show, then that show would die. If you moved a show from Tuesday at 8pm to Thursday at 8:30pm then you just lost your whole audience."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi said, "if you are going to put out a video once a week, put it out once a week. Put it out the same day each week if you can. Don't do once a month. Don't do random. Your audience starts to anticipate and look forward to your shows and knows when to expect them."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">A- Authenticity</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi only talks on the videos about what she believes in. There's no fluff. There's no pitch. She's exuberant and it shows on each video.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">H) LESS</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi and Alex were working 80-100 hour weeks. They had the money in the bank. They had achieved their goals. They loved what they were doing but when you hit a lifelong goal you start to ask, "is that it?"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">They got depressed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Goals are a myth. Our ancestors for 200,000 years didn't have goals. Every day started from scratch: hunt, forage, eat, sex, sleep, wake up to a new day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Then we were told to find our "goals". And now everyone asks, "I'm 17 years old and feel like I've accomplished nothing in life. What should I do?"</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Learning to find happiness with less is true wealth. Claudia and I recently got rid of most of our belongings, for instance. Then we started cancelling most meetings that I had set up. Sometimes it was hard. I had agreed to an event and then I would cancel.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Ultimately we are the sum of our experiences and not the sum of our belongings. There is nothing wrong with making money but it is only one small part of living a life of comfort, of compassion, of calm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Mimi and Alex started to focus more on the other things that were important in their lives. "And you know what happened?" Alex said. "The more we did that, the more money we made."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">– – –</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I really enjoyed talking to them. I am always curious how people made money through a channel like YouTube. Now I know and I think it can be replicated by anyone who is willing to do all of the above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">I'm afraid I don't have a face for YouTube. Or Instagram. And I'm not even sure I have a face for podcasting. But I think I love doing what I do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">And I like having the time to explore other interests and ideas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">And then sometimes I like doing nothing at all. There's nothing wrong with that also.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">– – –</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"> </p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">They pick up where they left off... Talking about being obligated to continue doing what brought you success.</p>
<p class="p1">Success can be a trap, but it's better than the alternative.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott Adams, creator of the <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/about/"><span class="s1">Dilbert comic strip</span></a> and author of <span class="s1"><em>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</em></span>, joins <em>The James Altucher Show</em> to talk about his career and how it landed him exactly where he wanted to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/James-Altucher/Latest-Episodes/Episode/736/Ep-47-Scott-Adams-The-Secret-to-Dilbert-s-Success">Click here</a></span> to listen to today's episode.</p>
<p class="p1">He shares with us the story about he became "super fit" and how that changed his life.</p>
<p class="p1">He and James dive into what makes a blog posts go viral. It may not be what you think.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott loves to experiment with what it takes a post to go viral. Is it the title, the content, the angle you choose to take, the target you choose... Or could it be something else.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott's been doing some Twitter testing. What's the ideal amount of characters, where should you place your hashtags?</p>
<p class="p1">What he's discovered is that when he mocks a group his tweet becomes popular because everyone thinks he's talking about someone else.</p>
<p class="p1">They also veer off into a quick conversation about how to stop ISIS.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen, and decide if you agree.</p>

<p class="p1">Success can be a trap, but it's better than the alternative.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott Adams, creator of the <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/about/">Dilbert comic strip</a> and author of <em>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</em>, joins <em>The James Altucher Show</em> to talk about his career and how it landed him exactly where he wanted to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/James-Altucher/Latest-Episodes/Episode/736/Ep-47-Scott-Adams-The-Secret-to-Dilbert-s-Success">Click here</a> to listen to today's episode.</p>
<p class="p1">He shares with us the story about he became "super fit" and how that changed his life.</p>
<p class="p1">He and James dive into what makes a blog posts go viral. It may not be what you think.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott loves to experiment with what it takes a post to go viral. Is it the title, the content, the angle you choose to take, the target you choose... Or could it be something else.</p>
<p class="p1">Scott's been doing some Twitter testing. What's the ideal amount of characters, where should you place your hashtags?</p>
<p class="p1">What he's discovered is that when he mocks a group his tweet becomes popular because everyone thinks he's talking about someone else.</p>
<p class="p1">They also veer off into a quick conversation about how to stop ISIS.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen, and decide if you agree.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Don't give up on your dreams. "Giving up on your dreams doesn't come for free," says Chris Hadfield, astronaut extraordinaire. Chris followed his dreams for 33 years before they became a reality.</p>
<p class="p1">Children dream. Children explore. Adults talk. And adults do. "We get the ability to explore way before we get common sense or perspective on how anything works," Chris says. If you stopped exploring, start again.</p>
<p class="p1">In today's interview you learn how to live the life you want. Take it from Chris. He's an astronaut so he really has an outside perspective.</p>
<p class="p1">Chris says, "When you're floating at the window of the space station and you go around the world every 92 minutes, you see the world in its completeness."</p>
<p class="p1">Chris lived his dreams because he explored his curiosity. That's the secret. You need to explore. No matter how impossible they seem, your dreams deserve exploring. That's the other secret. You need to believe in the impossible. Chris made the impossible possible and became the first Canadian astronaut to walk in space.</p>
<p class="p1">That doesn't mean he's never failed, though, which we talk about, too. "You will not reach the potential you're capable of – which to me is the ultimate risk, the ultimate loss – if you let yourself be minimized by fear," Chris says.</p>
<p class="p1">Believe in possible. Be curious. Explore.</p>

<p class="p1">I had the pleasure, no, the honor, of interviewing my good friend Stephen Dubner today. This is like being the best man at his wedding. It's a big day for Stephen.</p>
<p class="p1">Today, he's releasing his new book, <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062385321/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062385321&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>When to Rob a Bank</em>.</a></strong> What a great title, right?</p>
<p class="p1">In today's podcast, Stephen and I take some of our offline debates online.</p>
<p class="p1">We debate everything from who is most likely to try to kill you (hint: it's not strangers), to why the <em>New York Times</em> moderates comments – which according to Steven Levitt, coauthor of <em>When to Rob a Bank</em>, is because "there are too many people out there who don't know how to think about the world."</p>
<p class="p1">If you haven't read <em>Freakonomics</em>, <em>SuperFreakonomics</em>, and the whole lot of Stephen Dubner's books, then I highly recommend you do.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Tim Ferriss has a life-changing surprise for you.</p>
<p class="p1">It was expensive. I mean, it was expensive for him. It cost him a couple hundred thousand dollars to get. It also wasn't easy. He fought for a year and a half to get it.</p>
<p class="p1">This is going to change our lives. Yes, both of us.</p>
<p class="p1">Let me ask you this: What's the one skill you always wanted and don't have?</p>
<p class="p1">Is it Brazilian jiu-jitsu? Flirting? Playing poker? How to get out of a hostage situation? Whatever it is, you can learn it.</p>
<p class="p1">You just need to know how to learn. Learning is a skill.</p>
<p class="p1">Tim Ferriss did a bunch of experiments and mastered learning. In today's show, he reveals the secret to gaining any skill you ever wanted.</p>
<p class="p3">He FINALLY got digital rights to his TV show, <em>The Tim Ferriss Experiment</em>. It's about how to conquer fear in any skill at 10 times your learning speed. Think of it as <em>MythBusters</em> meets Jason Bourne.</p>
<p class="p1">"My job is to get people from zero percent to the top five percent in six months or less," he says, "The skill I'm refining is meta-learning. It's the toolkit."</p>
<p class="p1">The best part is that he filmed all 13 experiments. Now it's a show. It's "<em>MythBusters</em> meets <em>Jackass</em>." Clearly, a must watch.</p>
<p class="p1">I'm going to make my daughter binge-watch it today. Even if she has homework. This is more important. And more valuable.</p>
<p class="p1">The best part? He's releasing all 13 episodes "<em>House of Cards</em>-style" today.</p>
<p class="p3">They're available at <a href="http://www.fourhournewsletter.com/click.html?x=a62e&lc=PQ&mc=e&s=dWK3v&u=w&y=v&"><span class="s1">iTunes.com/timferriss</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In <em>The Tim Ferriss Experiment</em>, Tim goes around trying to learn the most difficult skills in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, he's successful. Other times, he has to pull himself out of having an anxiety attack.</p>
<p class="p1">In today's interview, Tim reveals why we suck at learning new skills. The best part is that it's not your fault. You can do anything you want. Think about it. People with no legs can run.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today to hear how to choose the best teacher, find an unorthodox mentor, alter your technique, and much more.</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>In this episode, you will learn:</strong></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">•</span>What's holding you back from learning the skills you want</li>
</ul>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4"><span class="s2">•</span>How to present yourself in the best way possible</li>

<p class="p1">Tim Ferriss did a bunch of experiments and mastered learning. In today's show, he reveals the secret to gaining any skill you ever wanted.</p>
<p class="p3">He FINALLY got digital rights to his TV show, <em>The Tim Ferriss Experiment</em>. It's about how to conquer fear in any skill at 10 times your learning speed. Think of it as <em>MythBusters</em> meets Jason Bourne.</p>
<p class="p1">"My job is to get people from zero percent to the top five percent in six months or less," he says, "The skill I'm refining is meta-learning. It's the toolkit."</p>
<p class="p1">The best part is that he filmed all 13 experiments. Now it's a show. It's "<em>MythBusters</em> meets <em>Jackass</em>." Clearly, a must watch.</p>
<p class="p1">I'm going to make my daughter binge-watch it today. Even if she has homework. This is more important. And more valuable.</p>
<p class="p1">The best part? He's releasing all 13 episodes "<em>House of Cards</em>-style" today.</p>
<p class="p3">They're available at <a href="http://www.fourhournewsletter.com/click.html?x=a62e&lc=PQ&mc=e&s=dWK3v&u=w&y=v&">iTunes.com/timferriss</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">In <em>The Tim Ferriss Experiment</em>, Tim goes around trying to learn the most difficult skills in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes, he's successful. Other times, he has to pull himself out of having an anxiety attack.</p>
<p class="p1">In today's interview, Tim reveals why we suck at learning new skills. The best part is that it's not your fault. You can do anything you want. Think about it. People with no legs can run.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today to hear how to choose the best teacher, find an unorthodox mentor, alter your technique, and much more.</p>
<p class="p4">In this episode, you will learn:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4">•What's holding you back from learning the skills you want</li>

The difference is we want to stand on the floor, not sleep on it. But maybe you should stop thinking that way. Maybe you should sleep on the floor.</p>
<p class="p1">Ryan Holiday didn't even sleep on his own floor. He slept on someone else's floor. Even better, it was his boss's floor. Maybe give that a try tonight. Sleep on your boss's floor. That's how you choose for yourself. Work with people whose floor you want to sleep on.</p>
<p class="p1">Ryan went from the floor to director of marketing of American Apparel. Now he runs his own creative consulting firm. He landed five clients on the New York Times bestseller list in one week. I'm one of Ryan's clients. He does great work. That's why I interviewed him a second time.</p>
<p class="p1">Tucker Max and Tim Ferris are his clients, too. And because no one is born a New York Times bestselling author (or maybe they are, I don't know), listen to Ryan's tips for aspiring authors.</p>
<p class="p1">He also reveals the most common reasons authors and entrepreneurs fail. Tip: you need to stop loving your ideas. Love for your ideas sets you up for failure. Hear why and hear the solution.</p>
<p class="p1">You might have heard me say, "85 percent of all businesses fail." Today, I share how to reduce your risk of failure to only 20 percent.</p>

			<title>Ep. 107 - Rich Roll: What Happens When You Turn On Your Inner Addict?</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Rich Roll was having a heart attack on his staircase. He was fat. He hated his work. He was unhappy.</p>
<p class="p1">A few years later, he ran, swam, and biked 703 miles in seven days when he was 45 years old.</p>
<p class="p1">When he was 40, he had a job he hated, but he was still trying to live the American dream: the two cars, the beautiful family, the partnership at a law firm.</p>
<p class="p1">"I thought I was having a heart attack on the staircase," he said. "I was 50 pounds overweight. I was working 80 hours a week. I wasn't happy. I was going to die."</p>
<p class="p1">That moment on the staircase was one of three or four turning points in Rich Roll's life that forced him to say: "I have a small window to change for the better." And then he did it.</p>
<p class="p1">But what's interesting to me is that Rich Roll is an addict. I'm an addict. Many people I know are addicts. Many addictions are bad for you. When I was younger, I was addicted to just about everything that could possibly be harmful to me.</p>
<p class="p1">Rich Roll, when he was 31 years old and a high-priced lawyer, had to check himself into a 100-day rehab center after he was drunk driving the wrong way down a one-way street.</p>
<p class="p1">While in rehab, he noticed something interesting. "At first it felt really horrible, and then it felt better."</p>
<p class="p2">When he was 40, he wasn't drinking, but he threw those obsessions into his NEXT unhealthy addiction.</p>
<p class="p1">"I was living on the window diet" – if you can drive up to a window and order the food, then that's what he would eat. Like three Wendy's cheeseburgers.</p>
<p class="p1">He threw himself into the lifestyle of top lawyer, 80 hours a week, eat whatever you can. But that moment on the stairs made him realize, with heart disease in his family, that he was at risk.</p>
<p class="p1">So he started a seven day cleanse. All juices.</p>
<p class="p1">"In the first three days I felt horrible, but I knew from my experience in rehab that it would get a lot better."</p>
<p class="p1">And it did. At the end of the juicing, he felt incredibly energetic and cleansed.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his third addiction. Gradually he went from juicing to a "junk vegetarian" style (pizza, etc.) to real plant-based vegan lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">"I had so much energy, I couldn't stop moving. Even sitting at rest I couldn't stop tapping my leg."</p>
<p class="p1">So one day he went for a run. He ran 24 miles. His biggest run prior that was 8 miles!</p>
<p class="p1">And that was 22 years earlier. Sorry, Rich, if I'm getting the numbers slightly wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, he realized this was some latent ability that was coming out so he started to train.</p>
<p class="p1">He trained every day. He started running in Iron Man competitions. Then the competitions got more and more intense until he did his 700 mile Hawaii run. Five Irons Mans in seven days.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his fourth addiction.</p>
<p class="p1">He was named one of the 50 fittest men in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">But he was still a lawyer part-time and training part-time.</p>
<p class="p1">He wrote a book about his lifestyle. He started giving talks for free and going to conferences.</p>
<p class="p1">Spreading the word on this healthy lifestyle that had changed his life invigorated his relationships and catapulted him to become one of the healthiest people in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his fifth addiction. He couldn't stop spreading the word about what was happening to him.</p>
<p class="p1">"It was hard at first," he said. "I wasn't getting paid and I was traveling everywhere." Gradually he started making a living at his new career and he gave up his job as a lawyer.</p>
<p class="p1">His book <em>The </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583335870/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1583335870&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>Plantpower</em></span></a><span class="s1"><em> Way</em></span>" is about to come out, describing his lifestyle even more.</p>
<p class="p1">Rich and I are one year apart in age. I can't even run down the block, although I try to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">People always demonize addiction. It's bad! Don't be an addict!</p>
<p class="p1">But there are positive addictions.</p>
<p class="p1">"Well-being" is being addicted to three things: competence, positive relationships, autonomy. And maybe one more thing: Growth every day in all three of those areas.</p>
<p class="p1">If you do those things, I can tell you that you will feel well-being today, no matter what else is going on in your life.</p>
<p class="p1">The first few days or weeks or months are really hard, but then, as Rich says, "suddenly it gets better."</p>
<p class="p1">When I was talking to Rich for an upcoming podcast, he would use the same language often when describing a bad addiction and a positive addiction:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>"I noticed I had to change."</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>"It was hard at first to get over it but I knew it would get better."</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>It was all-consuming for him and obviously, negative or positive, he loved the lifestyle.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>His family and friends were super-supportive and those were the people he gravitated toward.</li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s2">•</span>When he went from negative to positive in his life, he also suddenly went from AMBITION to MEANING.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are a lot of great books about habits and developing positive habits. A positive habit might be: brush your teeth twice a day or make your bed in the morning.</p>
<p class="p1">What's the difference between a habit and an addiction? I think there is a gray area here but roughly – a habit you can control. An addiction feels out of your control.</p>
<p class="p1">I bet that if Rich didn't exercise for a week, he would feel physically ill. I bet exercising and health are addictions for him.</p>
<p class="p2">---</p>
<p class="p1">What happened to Rich Roll?</p>
<p class="p1">He told me that during his time in rehab, someone asked him, "are you a human being having a spiritual experience or a spiritual being having a human experience?"</p>
<p class="p1">He said the question threw him off. He had never even thought in those terms before.</p>
<p class="p1">It was always the straight line: school, law school, lawyer, partner, family, two-car garage, retirement.</p>
<p class="p1">What does that question even mean?</p>
<p class="p1">The truth is: it doesn't have to mean anything. It just has to make you think. It has to give you a little bump off the straight line.</p>
<p class="p1">It has to tear you apart a little inside so you realize there's a world outside the one you've been living in.</p>
<p class="p1">---</p>
<p class="p1">I try to turn on my inner addict every day. I look at what I'm doing and I try to be competent, have good relationships, and have the freedom to do what I want. Or I try to grow toward those things.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe it means meeting new people. Or to be creative in some way. Or to try to get better at something. Or to start saying "No" more to the people who are trying to direct my life in ways good for them but not for me.</p>
<p class="p1">If I do that, I know I will get excited and my inner addict will turn on. And everyone's inner addict is different. I will NEVER run 100 miles. Or even one mile.</p>
<p class="p1">But every six months, my life has changed almost 100% as a result.</p>
<p class="p1">It's a gradual process. You can't be a "positive addict" overnight.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3">But when you "invest in yourself" as Rich told me he started doing, the universe conspires to help you find the right answers to questions that have no meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p1">I'm an addict and proud of it.</p>

<p class="p1">"I thought I was having a heart attack on the staircase," he said. "I was 50 pounds overweight. I was working 80 hours a week. I wasn't happy. I was going to die."</p>
<p class="p1">That moment on the staircase was one of three or four turning points in Rich Roll's life that forced him to say: "I have a small window to change for the better." And then he did it.</p>
<p class="p1">But what's interesting to me is that Rich Roll is an addict. I'm an addict. Many people I know are addicts. Many addictions are bad for you. When I was younger, I was addicted to just about everything that could possibly be harmful to me.</p>
<p class="p1">Rich Roll, when he was 31 years old and a high-priced lawyer, had to check himself into a 100-day rehab center after he was drunk driving the wrong way down a one-way street.</p>
<p class="p1">While in rehab, he noticed something interesting. "At first it felt really horrible, and then it felt better."</p>
<p class="p2">When he was 40, he wasn't drinking, but he threw those obsessions into his NEXT unhealthy addiction.</p>
<p class="p1">"I was living on the window diet" – if you can drive up to a window and order the food, then that's what he would eat. Like three Wendy's cheeseburgers.</p>
<p class="p1">He threw himself into the lifestyle of top lawyer, 80 hours a week, eat whatever you can. But that moment on the stairs made him realize, with heart disease in his family, that he was at risk.</p>
<p class="p1">So he started a seven day cleanse. All juices.</p>
<p class="p1">"In the first three days I felt horrible, but I knew from my experience in rehab that it would get a lot better."</p>
<p class="p1">And it did. At the end of the juicing, he felt incredibly energetic and cleansed.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his third addiction. Gradually he went from juicing to a "junk vegetarian" style (pizza, etc.) to real plant-based vegan lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">"I had so much energy, I couldn't stop moving. Even sitting at rest I couldn't stop tapping my leg."</p>
<p class="p1">So one day he went for a run. He ran 24 miles. His biggest run prior that was 8 miles!</p>
<p class="p1">And that was 22 years earlier. Sorry, Rich, if I'm getting the numbers slightly wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">After that, he realized this was some latent ability that was coming out so he started to train.</p>
<p class="p1">He trained every day. He started running in Iron Man competitions. Then the competitions got more and more intense until he did his 700 mile Hawaii run. Five Irons Mans in seven days.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his fourth addiction.</p>
<p class="p1">He was named one of the 50 fittest men in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">But he was still a lawyer part-time and training part-time.</p>
<p class="p1">He wrote a book about his lifestyle. He started giving talks for free and going to conferences.</p>
<p class="p1">Spreading the word on this healthy lifestyle that had changed his life invigorated his relationships and catapulted him to become one of the healthiest people in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">This was his fifth addiction. He couldn't stop spreading the word about what was happening to him.</p>
<p class="p1">"It was hard at first," he said. "I wasn't getting paid and I was traveling everywhere." Gradually he started making a living at his new career and he gave up his job as a lawyer.</p>
<p class="p1">His book <em>The </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583335870/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1583335870&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><em>Plantpower</em></a><em> Way</em>" is about to come out, describing his lifestyle even more.</p>
<p class="p1">Rich and I are one year apart in age. I can't even run down the block, although I try to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p class="p1">People always demonize addiction. It's bad! Don't be an addict!</p>
<p class="p1">But there are positive addictions.</p>
<p class="p1">"Well-being" is being addicted to three things: competence, positive relationships, autonomy. And maybe one more thing: Growth every day in all three of those areas.</p>
<p class="p1">If you do those things, I can tell you that you will feel well-being today, no matter what else is going on in your life.</p>
<p class="p1">The first few days or weeks or months are really hard, but then, as Rich says, "suddenly it gets better."</p>
<p class="p1">When I was talking to Rich for an upcoming podcast, he would use the same language often when describing a bad addiction and a positive addiction:</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1">•"I noticed I had to change."</li>
<li class="li1">•"It was hard at first to get over it but I knew it would get better."</li>
<li class="li1">•It was all-consuming for him and obviously, negative or positive, he loved the lifestyle.</li>
<li class="li1">•His family and friends were super-supportive and those were the people he gravitated toward.</li>
<li class="li1">•When he went from negative to positive in his life, he also suddenly went from AMBITION to MEANING.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">There are a lot of great books about habits and developing positive habits. A positive habit might be: brush your teeth twice a day or make your bed in the morning.</p>
<p class="p1">What's the difference between a habit and an addiction? I think there is a gray area here but roughly – a habit you can control. An addiction feels out of your control.</p>
<p class="p1">I bet that if Rich didn't exercise for a week, he would feel physically ill. I bet exercising and health are addictions for him.</p>
<p class="p2">---</p>
<p class="p1">What happened to Rich Roll?</p>
<p class="p1">He told me that during his time in rehab, someone asked him, "are you a human being having a spiritual experience or a spiritual being having a human experience?"</p>
<p class="p1">He said the question threw him off. He had never even thought in those terms before.</p>
<p class="p1">It was always the straight line: school, law school, lawyer, partner, family, two-car garage, retirement.</p>
<p class="p1">What does that question even mean?</p>
<p class="p1">The truth is: it doesn't have to mean anything. It just has to make you think. It has to give you a little bump off the straight line.</p>
<p class="p1">It has to tear you apart a little inside so you realize there's a world outside the one you've been living in.</p>
<p class="p1">---</p>
<p class="p1">I try to turn on my inner addict every day. I look at what I'm doing and I try to be competent, have good relationships, and have the freedom to do what I want. Or I try to grow toward those things.</p>
<p class="p1">Maybe it means meeting new people. Or to be creative in some way. Or to try to get better at something. Or to start saying "No" more to the people who are trying to direct my life in ways good for them but not for me.</p>
<p class="p1">If I do that, I know I will get excited and my inner addict will turn on. And everyone's inner addict is different. I will NEVER run 100 miles. Or even one mile.</p>
<p class="p1">But every six months, my life has changed almost 100% as a result.</p>
<p class="p1">It's a gradual process. You can't be a "positive addict" overnight.</p>
<p class="p1">But when you "invest in yourself" as Rich told me he started doing, the universe conspires to help you find the right answers to questions that have no meaning.</p>
<p class="p1">I'm an addict and proud of it.</p>

<p class="p1">Today he talks with James about a few of the self-sabotage practices he used to follow.

<p class="p1">Jon wrote his first book while working at AutoTrader.com, doing interviews from his car during lunch and giving talks on weekends when he could slip away. He'd get up early before work to write his blog, and he'd read everything he could find about becoming a better writer.</p>

<p class="p1">Today, they talk about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1426207557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&c"><span class="s1"><em>The Blue Zones</em>,</span></a> Dan's new book. It's a fascinating topic completed in conjunction with a 10-year project with <a href="http://www.bluezones.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Nat_Geo_Longevity.pdf"><span class="s1">National Geographic</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">It's not about just making it to 100; it's all about being healthy and active at 100, still enjoying life, and contributing.</p>
<p class="p1">As Dan says, "they are repositories of wisdom and human experience, and that's an asset that is frequently diminished in our society and really celebrated in Blue Zones."</p>
<p class="p1">If you want to live to 100, you should really learn the lessons of those who have lived to that age.</p>
<p class="p1">Is it biology? Is it the environment, diet, attitude, or something else, or is it a combination of all of the above?</p>
<p class="p3">"A long, healthy life is no accident. It begins with good genes, but it also depends on good habits. If you adopt the right lifestyle, experts say, chances are you may live up to a decade longer.</p>
<p class="p3">"The recipe for longevity, Buettner has found, is deeply intertwined with community, lifestyle, and spirituality. You won't find longevity in a bottle of diet pills or with hormone therapy. You'll find it by embracing a few simple but powerful habits, and by creating the right community around yourself."</p>
<p class="p3">In Blue Zones, age is celebrated, but here in the U.S., we warehouse our old people.</p>
<p class="p3">If you're interested in living to a healthy and happy 100 years young, then I suggest you read Dan's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1426207557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1426207557&linkCode=as2&tag=wwwjamesaltuc-20"><span class="s1"><em>The Blue Zones</em></span></a><span class="s2">, and listen here to this podcast.</span></p>

<p class="p1">P.S. Hi, James here...</p>
<p class="p1">My new book is finally out! It has taken me a year to put together all the skills I think are needed to create abundance in this new economy. I hope you write me with feedback and questions. I have more books coming.</p>
<p class="p1">Here's what the initial reviews on this book have said:</p>
<p class="p1">"<em>James Altucher did it again</em>.<em> I just finished and have to say it was a great read</em>.<em> Great insight into the future of wealth</em>."</p>
<p class="p1">"<em>I couldn't wait for this book to come out</em>.<em> It was well worth the wait! Very short and jam-packed with good ideas and advice for the budding entrepreneur</em>.<em> A must read!</em>"</p>
<p class="p1">"<em>This is the road map out</em>.<em> Very specific ideas to get you unstuck and to thrive in the 21st century</em>.<em> If you follow the ideas in this book your will receive 1000% or more in return on your investment</em>."</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, we have a very special show for you.</p>
<p class="p1">I recently hopped on a plane and headed to Palm Beach, Florida, where I recorded this two-part show from this gentleman's waterfront mansion. The man is a true legend in the field of entrepreneurship and investing, having started more than 100 companies, most of which have been successful.</p>
<p class="p1">My guest today is <em>New York Times </em>best-selling author Mark Ford. You might recognize Mark by his pen name, "Michael Masterson," but I also wouldn't be surprised if you've never heard of him. Unlike other business and financial "gurus," Mark is intensely private and has deliberately kept a low profile over the past 30 years. He has been a silent force behind the careers and ideas of many of the smartest people in investing and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="p1">Mark's accomplishments are as impressive as they are varied: he has built more than 100 businesses... amassed a fortune in the high eight-figure range... climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, speaks four languages... is a best-selling author of nearly 20 books... and at 64, he still wears his Brazilian jiu-jitsu <em>black belt </em>five times a week as he spars with men half his age.</p>
<p class="p1">But before you check out the interview, we forgot to include an important piece of information during the show. Mark <span class="s1">agreed to give away one of his most popular books to my listeners.</span></p>
<p class="p1">We start out today talking about what Mark calls, "becoming an intra-preneur." Not everyone can quit his or her job tomorrow. As an intra-preneur, you have to become the most valuable or one of the most valuable people within the company where you work.</p>
<p class="p1">Mark then tells me about two very different negotiation techniques that he has learned from two of his mentors. They couldn't be more different.</p>
<p class="p1">Mark talks today about the three sides of every business and which one you want to be a part of.</p>
<p class="p1">And as Mark says, "You have to promote yourself."</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, this is only part one of this amazing interview.</p>
<p class="p1">Make sure you go to <a href="http://research.palmbeachgroup.com/349504/"><span class="s1">markfordbook.com</span></a> and learn how you can claim your free copy of Mark's book, <em>Living Rich: How to Live as Well as a Billionaire on a Middle-Class Budget</em>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As James and Moisés dive into this conversation, they talk about a shift in power from West to East and North to South, from presidential palaces to public squares, from corporate giants like Microsoft to Google, to today's unknown startups.</p>
<p class="p1">In The End of Power, Moisés argues that power is not merely shifting and dispersing, it is also decaying. Those in power today are consistently at risk of losing it faster and easier than ever before.</p>
<p class="p1">Populations are shifting to cities… This is the youngest population in the history of the earth and more people than ever have joined the middle class. Because of this, Moisés explains to James today what he calls the three revolutions that we are currently going through. The More, the Mentality, and the Mobility.</p>
<p class="p1">When you listen to today's podcast, you'll understand why Mark Zuckerberg chose this as his first book on his new project to read one book a week in 2015.</p>

			<title>Ep. 100 - T. Harv Eker: Secrets of the Millionaire's Mind</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We all have what Eker calls your "money blueprint." You've been taught to think the thoughts you think.</p>
<p class="p1">If you were taught bad habits, then you may be programmed to continue to follow with bad habits throughout your life.</p>
<p class="p1">And when you realize this, you can make a profound change in your life.</p>
<p class="p1">From a very early age, Eker wanted nothing more than to become a millionaire. He tried so many different businesses to try to get there.</p>
<p class="p1">Every one of them failed.</p>
<p class="p1">What he eventually realized was that he had to focus on what he loved. He borrowed $2,000 on his credit card and started one of the first retail fitness stores. His vision wasn't one store; it was a chain of stores.</p>
<p class="p1">"Create a model, systemize it, and then duplicate it."</p>
<p class="p1">He finally found success and sold this business to a much larger company.</p>
<p class="p1">But as fate often has it, the skill set that he had to grow the business was not the same skill set he needed to manage his millions.</p>
<p class="p1">He realized he still needed to grow. There was something missing.</p>
<p class="p1">So the research began and it all begins with awareness.</p>
<p class="p1">Listen today to a great story of someone who realized that he had to "reprogram" his mind and how you can do the same.</p>
<p class="p1">Plus, Eker is giving away his Life makeover system for free to James' listeners. Go to <a href="http://www.Registerlms.com"><span class="s1">www.Registerlms.com</span></a><span class="s1">.</span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>Note:</strong> I want to apologize up front for the sound quality on this episode. We tried everything we could to get it as clear as possible but we thought this interview was so good we didn’t want to discard it.</p>
<p class="p1">Thanks in advance for struggling though – I promise it will be worth it.</p>
<p class="p1">Dave McClure has taken a slightly different path towards the funding of startups. He gets in early in a lot of company’s and expects about a third to fail.</p>
<p class="p1">He didn’t start investing as a venture capitalist until a little later in life and wasn’t sure if he was already too old.</p>
<p class="p1">Dave’s story runs through some of Silicon Valley’s best companies Facebook, PayPal, Mint.com, Simply Hired and others. So how did he deal with the fact that many of the people he worked side by side with wound up becoming billionaires?</p>
<p class="p1">By being so well connected and knowing so many people opens the door to a lot of opportunities but that doesn’t always mean your smart enough to pick the right ones. </p>
<p class="p1">Dave tells James the story of how he passed on being one of the first investors in Uber. He passed on the investment and that decision has probably cost him millions.</p>
<p class="p1">He tells James why he’s taking his company <a href="http://500.co/startups"><span class="s1">500 Startups</span></a> global. Valuations around the world are often cheaper outside the US but the real benefit may be to find companies that no one else is looking at.</p>
<p class="p2">Listen today to a great story of someone who may have started a little later in life but has built an amazing company</p>
<p class="p1">P.S.  Hi James here…</p>
<p class="p1">My new book is finally out! It's taken me a year to put together all the skills I think are needed to create abundance in this new economy. I hope you write me with feedback and questions. I have more books coming. </p>
<p class="p1">Here's what the initial reviews on this book have said: </p>
<p class="p1">"<em>James Altucher did it again. I just finished and have to say it was a great read. Great insight into the future of wealth."</em></p>
<p class="p1"><em>"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. It was well worth the wait! Very short and jam-packed with good ideas and advice for the budding entrepreneur. A must read!"</em></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Brian Koppelman joins James again today to answer all those questions that James was kicking himself for not asking during their first interview back in November.</p>
<p class="p1">Writing the super hit, <em>Solitary Man</em>, was a challenge different than any other Brian had yet taken on. And he tells James that he "got stuck." Fear would set in; he would see his limitations and get sidetracked.</p>
<p class="p1">Up until that time, Brian had been able to lean on his creative partner, David Levien, to help him find the way to power through the moment after his initial creativity wore off.</p>
<p class="p1">But when he was writing <em>Solitary Man</em> and showed it to Dave, he told him that it was clear Brian had to write this one himself. He had the character right, he had the voice right, and he had the tone down.</p>
<p class="p1">This was really the first time Brian had to complete a major work himself. Growing up with ADHD made this a real challenge for Brian. Dave had always been there in the past to push them through, but not this time.</p>
<p class="p1">So to help him move past his fears, Brian decided to do stand-up comedy. Not just going up on a stage once, but taking this on as a serious craft. He found that getting rejected helped him push through his writer's block.</p>
<p class="p1">Brian practices his craft in every medium every day. He hosts a podcast, produces hugely successful Vine video clips, and he's currently shooting a new TV pilot, <em>Billions</em>.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Brad Feld, an extremely successful early stage investor and serial entrepreneur, opens up to James about the struggles he has faced, both physical and mental.</p>
<p class="p1">He has struggled with depression and being an introvert in an extroverts' world. And he has learned the best ways to deal with it.</p>
<p class="p1">"Understanding yourself is extremely important."</p>
<p class="p3">Today, physical interaction is not nearly as important as it used to be. Today, you can interact in a meaningful way without having to go to a prospect's location.</p>
<p class="p3">As a venture capitalist, a partner at <a href="http://foundrygroup.com/team/brad-feld/"><span class="s1">Foundry Group</span></a>, and as someone having to deal with numerous businesses at the same time, Brad realized that just physically being somewhere does not solve the problem.</p>
<p class="p3">He understands that he's not able to just fly in like a hero and solve a problem. That takes a team of people.</p>
<p class="p3">James asks Brad what he looks for in an ideal entrepreneur and Brad tells him that he and his partners at Foundry Group have gone back to their original methods from the mid-'90s.</p>
<p class="p3">They stay focused on the themes they know best and only invest in companies that answer all of these questions correctly.</p>
<p class="p3">1. Is the product interesting?</p>
<p class="p3">2. Are the entrepreneurs <strong>obsessed</strong> with their product?</p>
<p class="p3">3. Do these entrepreneurs want to be long-term partners with them and do they want to be long-term partners with the entrepreneurs.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">James was recently in New York and caught up with his good friend and fellow podcaster Lewis Howes</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">They decided to drop into the studio and record a podcast for <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The James Altucher Show </em>and another for Lewis's podcast, </span><a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/james-altucher/"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">The School of Greatness</span></em></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">, one of James' favorite shows.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lewis' bio is simply amazing and way too long to rewrite here, but if you want to grow your business, improve your personal life, and live the live you've always dreamt of, then </span><a href="http://lewishowes.com/"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">click here</span></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> to learn how.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">They jump right in and catch up since Lewis was last on <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The James Altucher Show </em>(</span><a href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/Frank-Curzio/Latest-Episodes/Episode/475/Ep-5-Lewis-Howes-The-Millionaire-Who-Couldn-t-Read"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Episode 5</span></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lewis plays </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPfVVdX9vok"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">handball</span></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> for the U.S. National Team Handball. You'll hear James laugh as Lewis explains this style of handball. It's like the combination of every other sport.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">They begin the podcast there.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Lewis decided he wanted to make the U.S. National Team and, as you'll hear, he did whatever it took to get selected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">James tells Lewis he's going to steal everything from all his best podcasts.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">James was recently in New York and caught up with his good friend and fellow podcaster Lewis Howes</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They decided to drop into the studio and record a podcast for <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The James Altucher Show </em>and another for Lewis's podcast, <a href="http://lewishowes.com/podcast/james-altucher/"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The School of Greatness</em></a>, one of James' favorite shows.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lewis' bio is simply amazing and way too long to rewrite here, but if you want to grow your business, improve your personal life, and live the live you've always dreamt of, then <a href="http://lewishowes.com/">click here</a> to learn how. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They jump right in and catch up since Lewis was last on <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The James Altucher Show </em>(<a href="http://www.stansberryradio.com/Frank-Curzio/Latest-Episodes/Episode/475/Ep-5-Lewis-Howes-The-Millionaire-Who-Couldn-t-Read">Episode 5</a>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lewis plays <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPfVVdX9vok">handball</a> for the U.S. National Team Handball. You'll hear James laugh as Lewis explains this style of handball. It's like the combination of every other sport.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They begin the podcast there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lewis decided he wanted to make the U.S. National Team and, as you'll hear, he did whatever it took to get selected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">James tells Lewis he's going to steal everything from all his best podcasts. They start with Lewis podcast with Yuri Elkaim and the benefits and hacks to a great night's sleep. Here's a hint...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Buy a snake plant. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next up was Lewis' amazing interview with Jim Kwik on how to master your memory. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Lewis then offers up his "common lessons of greatness"... </p>

<p class="p1">Like most screenwriters, he moved to Hollywood to launch his career. He started as an assistant to a talent agent hoping to get the contacts in place when he had his script ready.</p>
<p class="p1">But over the couple of years he was there, he read thousands of scripts which left him very little time to work on his own. He made contacts but they didn't see him as a screenwriter.</p>
<p class="p1">His dream just wasn't happening...</p>
<p class="p1">He was stuck, so he just quit and for the next six years he was just another obscure writer living in N.Y.</p>
<p class="p1">He and Brian finally reunited and decided they'd join forces to try writing a screenplay together. They had no idea what they were going to write about but they just kept at it.</p>
<p class="p1">As luck would have it, Brian was invited to The Mayfair Club for a game of poker. He immediately called David and said, "This place was amazing. We can make the movie about this."</p>

<p class="p1">His parents gave him two years to make a go at it, but secretly he gave himself five.</p>
<p class="p1">As Ben tells James, he never wanted to do anything else. After college, he locked himself in his apartment and wrote nine novels. He got rejection letter after rejection letter, about 190 in all.</p>

<p class="p1">But as he says...</p>
<p class="p2">Nobody was reading them, until he finally got his break.</p>
<p class="p1">Ben has now authored fifteen best-selling books. His book, <em>The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal</em> – debuted at #4 on the New York Times list.</p>
<p class="p1">The book was adapted into the movie <em>The Social Network</em> – written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher – and was #1 at the box office for two weeks, won Golden Globes for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay, best score, and was nominated for eight Oscars, winning three.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">How do you transform your life?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">The answer is simple. Come up with 10 ideas a day. Every day. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad; the point is to exercise your idea muscle, to make it sweat.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; background: white;">Today James talks with Claudia about her brand new book,</span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1502593009/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1502593009&linkCode=as2&tag=stansradio-20"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">Become an Idea Machine: Because Ideas Are the Currency of the 21st Century</span></em></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">People say ideas are cheap and execution is everything, but that is NOT true. Execution is a consequence, a subset of good, brilliant idea. And good ideas require daily work.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">As Claudia explains, coming up with <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;">10</strong> ideas a day is very important.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">Ideas may be easy if you are only coming up with one or two, but if you try to produce more than three, you will feel a burn, scratch your head, and you will be sweating and working hard. There is a turning point when you reach idea number six for the day, when you still have four to go, and your mind muscle is getting a workout. By the time you list those last ideas to make it to ten, you will see for yourself what "sweating the idea muscle" means.</span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">When you practice every day your life will transform...</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">Life changes for the better when we become the source of positive, insightful, and helpful ideas.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; background: white;">Challenge yourself to try it for 180 days and see your life transform, in magical ways, in front of your very eyes.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The answer is simple. Come up with 10 ideas a day. Every day. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad; the point is to exercise your idea muscle, to make it sweat.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Today James talks with Claudia about her brand new book,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1502593009/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1502593009&linkCode=as2&tag=stansradio-20"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Become an Idea Machine: Because Ideas Are the Currency of the 21st Century</em></a>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People say ideas are cheap and execution is everything, but that is NOT true. Execution is a consequence, a subset of good, brilliant idea. And good ideas require daily work. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Claudia explains, coming up with 10 ideas a day is very important. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ideas may be easy if you are only coming up with one or two, but if you try to produce more than three, you will feel a burn, scratch your head, and you will be sweating and working hard. There is a turning point when you reach idea number six for the day, when you still have four to go, and your mind muscle is getting a workout. By the time you list those last ideas to make it to ten, you will see for yourself what "sweating the idea muscle" means. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you practice every day your life will transform...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Life changes for the better when we become the source of positive, insightful, and helpful ideas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Challenge yourself to try it for 180 days and see your life transform, in magical ways, in front of your very eyes.</p>

<p class="p3">Don't try to write it to get a TV job, just make it great. Whether it's a 10-minute standup comedy routine or a short play you perform with your friends.</p>
<p class="p3">Whatever it is, get it up on YouTube...</p>
<p class="p3">No matter what happens, whether the show is picked up for another season or not, and of course Simon says he hopes it is. "It's been the best year of my life." He has a huge list of other projects he is currently working on.</p>

<p class="p3">No matter what happens, whether the show is picked up for another season or not, and of course Simon says he hopes it is. "It's been the best year of my life." He has a huge list of other projects he is currently working on.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Shank originally thought he wanted to be a Hollywood film director so he moved out to California to find his fame. He managed to get a job with the legendary director Wes Craven and worked on the now famous movie Scream.</p>
<p>Quickly he learned that his reality wasn't anything like his dream. He spent most of his time running errands just like 99% of the others with the same dream.</p>
<p>His entrepreneurial spirit kicked in quickly and he decided to create his own destiny so he moved to the center of the dot-com world, San Francisco.</p>
<p>Sam knew he wanted to start a technology business, but knew he wasn't ready yet. So he decided to try to learn everything he could. He knew he was ready when, as he says, "You're ready when it feels just uncomfortable enough that you can bear starting a company because it's hard, it's intimidating, it's going to be a total grind, it's brutal, it's the hardest thing you're ever going to do. So you have to go in knowing that." He says, "The best way to learn about starting a business is to start a business" and he's an advocate of starting early in your career.</p>
<p>He knew he wasn't ready until about 10 years ago when he started TravelPost, which wasn't a great business model so he pivoted and broadened the business model.</p>
<p>He suddenly found success. It wasn't perfect, and he learned a lot from this move that he would use for his next company, Dealbase.com.</p>
<p>Running Dealbase gave him the knowledge he needed to create HotelTonight. He has raised over $80 million so far and they're opening offices around the world.</p>
<p>Listen in as James asks Sam about a few ideas he has for HotelTonight. Sam loves them, and offers James a job as a product consultant.</p>
<p>It's a great interview and a great app. If you need a last minute room for the holidays, why don't you give HotelTonight a try?</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jay Jay French, guitarist, manager, and producer is most famous for his role as the founding member and one of the guitarists of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister </p>
<p class="p1">Long:</p>
<p class="p1">Jay Jay French explains Twisted Sisters long-term success like it's an iceberg. What you see on the surface is only 10% of what's really there.</p>
<p class="p1">They've continually reinvested in themselves. Whenever they'd make a little money, instead of just spending it, they'd roll the dice and plow it right back into the group.</p>
<p class="p1">As <a href="http://www.inc.com/author/jay-jay-french"><span class="s1">Jay has written,</span></a> "Whether you are an artist or an entrepreneur, your story usually begins with passion, a moment that goes something like this: 'The first time I either witnessed, touched, smelled, felt, heard [this object of passion], I just knew that I would do anything, risk anything to be a part of this life...'"</p>
<p class="p3">That Big Bang moment truly defines you. Most people can tell you the exact date and time that this tsunami of inspiration and passion washed over their brain cells, rendering them helpless to the immutable forces that drive the human spirit.</p>
<p class="p3">My Big Bang happened on February 9, 1964 at 8:03 p.m.</p>
<p class="p3">That night, I (and 73 million other Americans) saw the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show. I was 11 years old, but I emphatically told my mother that I wanted to be a rock 'n' roll star on that very night. Over the next couple of weeks, after reading every Beatle magazine that appeared magically the day after the Sullivan show, my actual goal started to crystallize: I wanted to make great rock 'n' roll music, play to screaming girls, get a gold record, and be a millionaire!</p>
<p class="p3">Like many entrepreneurs who are first starting out, I had no idea how any of this was going to happen. I just knew that it had to happen. But achieving your goals not only takes passion, it takes patience.</p>
<p class="p3">I did finally get that gold record. It happened in July of 1984, 20 years and five months after I set my goal. It was a long journey, but it taught me every lesson that I ever wanted (and didn't want) to learn, including how to market a brand, how to negotiate deals, how to handle a crisis, and how to manage some big personalities. But without passion, without that Big Bang, I would have never had the drive to get started – or to keep going.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Not only is he the lead and rhythm guitar player for Twisted Sister, but he backs up Dee Snider's lead vocals and is </span>the owner of the Twisted Sister trademark. He is the manager of the band's affairs and recently celebrated 40 years as a member. </p>
<p class="p5">Listening to this interview, you'll understand why they've lasted so long.</p>
<p class="p5">"Do what you say you're going to do."</p>
<p class="p5">If you follow that commandment, you stand a good chance of succeeding.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Ep. 72 - Daniel O'Brien of Cracked.com: How to Fight Presidents</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel O'Brien's love of presidents started early. As he recounts the story in his hilarious book, How To Fight Presidents, it all started when his American Government professor said on his very first day of class, "Not one of you is ever going to grow up to be president of the United States."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He never wanted to be president but when that professor told him he couldn't even if he wanted to, something triggered inside him and he thought... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, yeah? I'll show you. I'm going to be president. I'm going to be president all over this country and there's not a damn thing you can do about it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On today's James Altucher Show, James and Daniel talk about our "badass" presidents and which ones Daniel thinks he could beat up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2007, while still in college, Daniel wrote an article that he thought might work on Cracked.com. They bought it and a bunch more. He's now Head Writer and Creative Director of Video having written more than 200 articles to date and his article "The 5 Most Badass Presidents of All-Time" has been downloaded almost 11 million times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James asks Daniel his favorite comedians and immediately he answers, Bob Newhart (and here). He also likes John Mulaney, Bo Burnham's – what, and Tim Minchin (careful, these two are X rated). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They cover their favorite comedy books, TV shows, and movies. James' favorite is SuperBad.</p>
<p> </p>

As he recounts the story in his hilarious book, How To Fight Presidents, it all started when his American Government professor said on his very first day of class, "Not one of you is ever going to grow up to be president of the United States."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He never wanted to be president but when that professor told him he couldn't even if he wanted to, something triggered inside him and he thought... </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Oh, yeah? I'll show you. I'm going to be president. I'm going to be president all over this country and there's not a damn thing you can do about it."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On today's James Altucher Show, James and Daniel talk about our "badass" presidents and which ones Daniel thinks he could beat up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2007, while still in college, Daniel wrote an article that he thought might work on Cracked.com. They bought it and a bunch more. He's now Head Writer and Creative Director of Video having written more than 200 articles to date and his article "The 5 Most Badass Presidents of All-Time" has been downloaded almost 11 million times.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>James asks Daniel his favorite comedians and immediately he answers, Bob Newhart (and here). He also likes John Mulaney, Bo Burnham's – what, and Tim Minchin (careful, these two are X rated). </p>
<p> </p>
<p>They cover their favorite comedy books, TV shows, and movies. James' favorite is SuperBad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you like comedy, then this show is for you. Their list of must-watch shows is almost endless.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Alex Blumberg thought, why not invite the audience in and let them follow him build a podcasting company. He was never sure that idea would work and spent hours and hours editing the first few episodes before launch.</p>

<p>He took the leap of faith, the stars aligned, and Startup – Alex's first podcast – has become a huge success. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Alex and James talk today about the difference between running a for-profit vs. a non-profit company. What are you willing to give up for money; equity, lifestyle, family life? This is a tough question for every new entrepreneur to answer and Alex is still trying to figure it all out.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">James lands an interview with arguably the ultimate "Choose Yourselfer "and greatest modern-day motivational speaker, Tony Robbins. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tony talks with James about his soon-to-be-released book <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom</em>. This might be his best book yet. Tony interviews the 50 most successful people to learn what it takes to be financially secure, independent, and free. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Tony tells the story about the time he sold a two-star Army general on how he could take any training program they had and cut the time in half. The general didn't think Tony could succeed. After interviewing many soldiers, he discovered the key to success. It's the same key anyone can use to achieve financial freedom.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">You'll also hear how Tony was forced to start over at the age of 39. He believes his newest book will help everyone that's in a similar position. Whether you're well off or trying to figure out how you're going to pay this month's rent, this episode has something for you.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">He tells James why he considers money a game and why you should start looking at it this way. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">James calls this the Tony Robbins Method</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">In the interview James says, "Ok, I figured it out. You use "the Tony Robbins Method'". </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Which I defined as,</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">1) At first you don't know anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">2) You find five people who are the experts in the world.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">3) You extensively interview them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">4) You figure out the simplest things they have in common with each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">5) You do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal">James lands an interview with arguably the ultimate "Choose Yourselfer "and greatest modern-day motivational speaker, Tony Robbins. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tony talks with James about his soon-to-be-released book <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">MONEY Master the Game: 7 Simple Steps to Financial Freedom</em>. This might be his best book yet. Tony interviews the 50 most successful people to learn what it takes to be financially secure, independent, and free. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Tony tells the story about the time he sold a two-star Army general on how he could take any training program they had and cut the time in half. The general didn't think Tony could succeed. After interviewing many soldiers, he discovered the key to success. It's the same key anyone can use to achieve financial freedom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You'll also hear how Tony was forced to start over at the age of 39. He believes his newest book will help everyone that's in a similar position. Whether you're well off or trying to figure out how you're going to pay this month's rent, this episode has something for you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He tells James why he considers money a game and why you should start looking at it this way. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">James calls this the Tony Robbins Method</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the interview James says, "Ok, I figured it out. You use "the Tony Robbins Method'". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Which I defined as,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">1) At first you don't know anything.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">2) You find five people who are the experts in the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">3) You extensively interview them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">4) You figure out the simplest things they have in common with each other.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">5) You do that simple thing over and over and over and over (repetition).</p>

They both, albeit at different times, played poker at the legendary Mayfair Club and relive some of those great stories. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">As Brian says, "You'd leave early in the morning either with a gangsters roll in your pocket or knowing you'd just lost… but somehow as you'd walk out, four, four-thirty, five in the morning and get into a gypsy cab... something just felt right in the world..."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;">Brian attributes a lot of his success to his ADHD. He's able to laser focus in things that fascinate him. When he came across the singer-songwriter Tracey Chapman, he was hooked. She had something very special and he "knew it." But "knowing it" and getting her to believe he knew it and that he could help her took years of hard work. She originally said no a hundred times in a row.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>One of James' favorite shows starts its new season TONIGHT!<br /><br />We don't know how he did it, but he has somehow convinced the star of the show to be today's guest.<br /><br />Would you ever invest your time and money into a business that is basically going under with no hopes of recovering?<br /><br />What if the entire process were filmed and broadcast to millions of people?<br /><br />That might sound crazy, but that is exactly what today's guest does for a living.<br /><br />Marcus Lemonis, CEO of Camping World and star of the CNBC all-new reality series, "The Profit," joins The James Altucher Show.<br /><br />"The Profit" is a television show where struggling small businesses are offered cash and expertise in exchange for a percentage of ownership in their company.<br /><br />Marcus has a real passion for helping others and making businesses successful.<br /><br />For him, it's more than just business plans, numbers, and formulas... "Business success is always about the three P's: People, Process, and Product".<br /><br />What Marcus really enjoys is finding out what makes people tick, what motivates them, and how they can reinvent themselves as well as their business.<br /><br />Have you ever considered starting your own business? How about taking one out of bankruptcy? <br /><br />Marcus just bought Crumbs Bakery and James wants to know why. What does Marcus see in this bankrupt company that nobody else does?<br /><br />Marcus explains that Crumbs was a great business but its product line was just too niched.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of James' favorite shows starts its new season TONIGHT!We don't know how he did it, but he has somehow convinced the star of the show to be today's guest.Would you ever invest your time and money into a business that is basically going under with no hopes of recovering?What if the entire process were filmed and broadcast to millions of people?That might sound crazy, but that is exactly what today's guest does for a living.Marcus Lemonis, CEO of Camping World and star of the CNBC all-new reality series, "The Profit," joins The James Altucher Show."The Profit" is a television show where struggling small businesses are offered cash and expertise in exchange for a percentage of ownership in their company.Marcus has a real passion for helping others and making businesses successful.For him, it's more than just business plans, numbers, and formulas...

"Why were you going to die?""People lose money every day... how many millions did you lose?""How did you lose it? How did you make it back again?" James reveals all the mistakes that led to his darkest moments... times where he thought he would never see the light again.Divorced, no job, completely broke, millions have been lost. When you feel that your children would be better off with your life-insurance policy instead of you... how do you come back from something like that?And... James reveals a HUGE secret that nobody else knows... not even Claudia.He has always been open and honest with his listeners and followers of his blog, twitter, and Facebook. But today EVERYTHING is revealed... absolutely nothing is off the table.He was able to completely turn his life around... something that most individuals in the same type of situations would not be fortunate enough to do.His success, triumph, and passion are truly admirable and could be inspiration to use toward your own life.It is the ultimate "choose yourself" episode... Enjoy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Aaron is out so James asked his wife, Claudia, to join as his co-host to talk about their new book, The Power of No.How many times have you heard yourself saying "yes" to the wrong things – overwhelming requests, bad relationships, time-consuming obligations? How often have you wished you could summon the power to turn them down?James and Claudia talk about how this book is a practical guide that helps you take back that power – and shows that a well-placed "no" can not only save you time and trouble... it can save your life.Drawing on their own stories as well as feedback from their readers and students, James and Claudia clearly show that you have the right to say no to:•    Anything that is hurting you•    Standards that no longer serve you•    People who drain you of your creativity and expression•    Beliefs that are not true to the real you"It's one thing to say no," the authors explain, "it's another thing to have the 'Power of No.' When you do, you will have a stronger sense of what is good for you and the people around you, and you will have a deeper understanding of who you are. And, ultimately, you'll be free to say a truly powerful 'Yes' in your life – one that opens the door to opportunities, abundance, and love."This is like a chance to sit down with the authors and get the inside scoop.If you Pre-order NOW, before July 15, 2014, you can get THREE FREE GIFTS1.    Bonus Audio Chapter: "The Opportunity Cost of NO"2.    Bonus Audio Chapter: "What to Do When Someone Says NO – To YOU"3.    Free PDF Copy of The Choose Yourself StoriesClick here to get the details on how you can pre-order.We hope you use The Power of No and the bonus materials to live your best "Yes!" life.Enjoy!</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, political consultant, journalist, and author, joins The James Altucher Show<br /><br />"You've created a 'Choose Yourself Career.'" Nobody could have just given you the career you've had. You've had to go and hunt for that career. You had to kill for that career. You made it up yourself as you went along.<br /><br />This week, Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, political consultant, journalist, and author, joins The James Altucher Show to talk about who will be the next President of the United States, the future of the media, and Ken's million-dollar deal that's still out there for the right entrepreneur to grab and run with.<br /><br />"Green was my one great idea in my life." There really is room, in my opinion, for a legitimate inheritor to the Greenmantle." <br /><br />James and Ken then jump right into what it was like to work with America's Mayor, Rudy Guilliani. You'll get a firsthand look at what it's like running for President of the United States and what it takes to win.<br /><br />James asks Ken who he thinks the 2016 Republican and Democratic front runners are right now. You might be very surprised by his picks.<br /><br />They talk about getting rid of our two-party system because, as James says, "It doesn't seem to work at all. The candidates are very similar. I mean, in very rare cases, can I tell a difference in policy, actually, between Obama and Bush. It just seems like the two-party system and the lack of democracy, as you mentioned, is just a total failure."<br /><br />But Ken disagrees… "Yeah, I don't agree. I think the two-party system is a disaster except for all the other systems that have tried democracy which is an inversion of the old democracy is terrible except for all the other systems."<br /><br />And so James offers up a brand-new, high-tech system that he believes could really help.<br /><br />Plus, James asks Ken "So what's next in the media industry?" <br /><br />I think you'll be very surprised by Ken's answer... <br /><br />"I don't think Twitter is the end of news. I believe we're kind of in a golden age of attention span. There's never been a time where people would watch 13 hours of beautifully written television in a row; the same show. I think it's really the beginning."<br /><br />Hope you enjoy.</p>]]></description>

You made it up yourself as you went along.This week, Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, political consultant, journalist, and author, joins The James Altucher Show to talk about who will be the next President of the United States, the future of the media, and Ken's million-dollar deal that's still out there for the right entrepreneur to grab and run with."Green was my one great idea in my life." There really is room, in my opinion, for a legitimate inheritor to the Greenmantle." James and Ken then jump right into what it was like to work with America's Mayor, Rudy Guilliani. You'll get a firsthand look at what it's like running for President of the United States and what it takes to win.James asks Ken who he thinks the 2016 Republican and Democratic front runners are right now. You might be very surprised by his picks.They talk about getting rid of our two-party system because, as James says, "It doesn't seem to work at all. The candidates are very similar. I mean, in very rare cases, can I tell a difference in policy, actually, between Obama and Bush. It just seems like the two-party system and the lack of democracy, as you mentioned, is just a total failure."But Ken disagrees… "Yeah, I don't agree. I think the two-party system is a disaster except for all the other systems that have tried democracy which is an inversion of the old democracy is terrible except for all the other systems."And so James offers up a brand-new, high-tech system that he believes could really help.Plus, James asks Ken "So what's next in the media industry?" I think you'll be very surprised by Ken's answer... "I don't think Twitter is the end of news. I believe we're kind of in a golden age of attention span. There's never been a time where people would watch 13 hours of beautifully written television in a row; the same show. I think it's really the beginning."Hope you enjoy.</p>]]></content:encoded>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">It's a question many of us are too afraid to answer..</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">"Is this as good as it gets?"</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Perhaps you feel that way from time to time. You get stuck in an unfulfilling job. You get stuck with a mortgage you can barely pay, in a house that didn't make you any happier than your previous home. You get stuck in a negative relationship. And you wonder if things will ever get better.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">James Altucher knows the feeling well. And in the latest episode of his radio show, he shows you exactly how to get "un-stuck" by making your negative life experiences work <em>for </em>you instead of against you.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">The type of unconventional ideas you'll hear on his show made James a millionaire... and many of his guests have done the same.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">This week's guest is no exception..</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;"> Dr. Wayne Dyer has seen plenty of obstacles in his life... but his attitude and belief in the power of self-reliance have earned him the title "father of motivation" by his fans.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">A hard worker since his first paper route at age 9, Dr. Dyer says, "There's never been a moment when I was unemployed, ever."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">He was an orphan, served in the military, taught at a prestigious university, had eight children of his own, and made a comfortable life for himself in Hawaii.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">To say he is influential is an understatement.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">His first book, <em>Your Erroneous Zones</em>, was not only a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, but it sold more than 100 million copies in 47 languages... and was even smuggled to readers living behind the Iron Curtain of the 1980's.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">He is one of the most prolific writers of our time. In fact, he has authored 40 books.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">But like we mentioned earlier, some people really struggle with the feeling that their life is ordinary and unimportant...</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">James and Dr. Dyer explain why getting "un-stuck" is so important.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Dr. Dyer explains "If you're feeling stuck, your stuckness is going to have a physical impact on you... You're gonna get sick if you stay stuck."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">More importantly, he shows you exactly how to get un-stuck, and live the life you were meant to lead.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">The tips and ideas Dr. Dyer discusses in the show are wide ranging.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">From how to side-step fights with your wife... to avoiding the most common regret of the dying... Dr. Dyer's advice is well worth listening to.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">We’ll be the first to admit this was an intense show.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-family: Verdana;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">But Dr. Dyer is one of the most inspirational speakers in the world... And when combined with James' fascinating, original take on the world, the result is riveting.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">You've heard the stories about college dropouts who go on to become billionaires... like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerburg...</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">And you might even know that 20% of America's millionaires never stepped foot on a college campus.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">But how many guys have you heard of who read at a second grade level... yet go on to be millionaires?</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">My guess is none... but you're about to meet one.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">His name is Lewis Howes, and he's this week's guest on the James Altucher Show, a radio show we recently helped to launch.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Lewis Howes' story is nothing short of amazing...</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">At age 10, he was 6'3". He described himself as a "gangly, skinny, ugly, acne kid, who couldn't read or write or do anything."</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">In the eighth grade, he could only read at a second-grade level. He cheated on every test in high school because he says that's the only way he could pass.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">But Lewis' life changed dramatically after talking his way into college. He wanted to become a football player... and despite a series of major setbacks and injuries, he became a <em>two-time All-American</em>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Thing is... when it came time to leave college, the NFL didn't want him. He had no other skills. He was broke and depressed.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">By now, you might be wondering how listening to a former semi-pro football player can help you become more successful and wealthy.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Turns out, a lot more than you'd think... Howes figured out an ingenious way to make a fortune. At one time, he was making an incredible $60,000 per hour.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">This week, you'll hear the amazing story of Lewis Howes, who now travels the globe teaching people exactly how they can achieve their dreams.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Schools can't prep you for success anymore.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Today's millionaires prove that if schooling and traditional employment does not work for you, then you must figure out how to connect with people on a different level.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">And Lewis teaches you exactly what you need to do to get there.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">He reveals the secret thing that people should <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>never, ever</strong></span> do when they're trying to get ahead. I was shocked because it's usually the first thing people think they SHOULD do!</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">He also reveals the question that he always asks during networking sessions. Lewis explains, "That simple question opened the door" to his future as a millionaire.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 11px; font-size: 13px; font-family: Verdana;">Like James Altucher, Lewis Howes is a quirky, interesting guy, who's become a huge success by thinking outside the box.</p>
