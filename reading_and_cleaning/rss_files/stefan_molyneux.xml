It has been necessary because a rational proof of secular ethics has never been achieved; it has been ridiculous because it is impossible to imagine any scientific or mathematical argument being advanced in such a hysterical and violent manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Ethics” has been one of the great government programs of history; since kings and priests ruled mankind, only those philosophers who served their interests tended to get promoted to prominence, rather than imprisoned, poisoned or burned.

It has been necessary because a rational proof of secular ethics has never been achieved; it has been ridiculous because it is impossible to imagine any scientific or mathematical argument being advanced in such a hysterical and violent manner.<br /><br />“Ethics” has been one of the great government programs of history; since kings and priests ruled mankind, only those philosophers who served their interests tended to get promoted to prominence, rather than imprisoned, poisoned or burned. Thus, over 2,500 years since its inception, the discipline of ethics remains largely subjectivist, relativist and cultural – and was not only unable to restrain, but may have played a part in promoting the horrors, wars and genocides of the 20th century, the bloodiest hundred years of history of our species.<br /><br />Stefan Molyneux has written "Universally Preferable Behavior: A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics,” which presents radical and rational arguments for a nonreligious, non-statist, entirely secular set ethical standards which validate the nonaggression principle – thou shalt not initiate force against thy fellow human – and the fundamental logic for respecting property rights.<br /><br />Rigorous, analytical and challenging, “Universally Preferable Behavior” provides a solid foundation for secular ethics.

It is clear atheism is statistically aligned with leftism in all its cancers; however, I've noticed many in the New Right, Alt-Right and general Nationalist camps sympathize with Christianity as a means of saving the West. Do you find this remotely reasonable and, if so, do you ever consider we advocate for moral/biblical propaganda in order to keep those unable to retain the West without unproven dogma in check? Or, is that a means of control but in a positive way? Thoughts?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [25:50] - "I am starting a business with a friend of mine, and although we have high hopes, I worry about putting time, effort, and money into it only for it to flop.  When do you know when it's time to stop? How do you know when it's the right time to give up and move on to something else?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:09:51] - “Since I was a kid I've been somewhat obsessed with the idea of finding a girlfriend. Throughout my teenage years, I had a problem with depression and putting women up on a pedestal and went though many years of women taking advantage of me emotionally because of this. I'm now in college and I've lost a good amount of weight, changed my style, and became much more confident with myself. My social skills have increased and I feel much more comfortable around women.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“However, I still have not been in a relationship yet and my depression has turned itself into cynicism and anger. I'm not typically an angry guy, but seeing people around me in college act irresponsibly but be much more successful in their relationships makes me feel isolated and jealous. I don't consider myself desperate because I still have standards and morals that I don't want to go against, but I feel like being this angry and constantly comparing myself to others is unhealthy. What can I do to relieve myself of the anger and frustration I feel as a result of being unsuccessful in my pursuit of a relationship?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:06:45] - “One of the issues I have been wrestling with for years, both in my own mind and in discussion with others, has been the question of nationhood. What does it mean to be part of a nation? In other countries, the people identify as a nation based on a common race, a common culture, or a common language.  In this sense, the nation is a kind of extended tribe. But in contrast, America is unique in its definition of nation. We broke from the country with which we shared a common race, a common language, and a common system of justice, and we defined our new nation in terms of unique shared values, experiences and our desire for independence, freedoms, and pursuit for our own happiness.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“In current discussions of nations and borders, there is a drive for erasing national sovereignty and forcing culturally incompatible peoples to live in the same space. In contrast, under the American Constitution, the individual states are granted ‘states rights’ so that they can exercise different policies and approaches to solving diverse economic and social problems. Shouldn't people who share common beliefs and culture be allowed to attempt to define nations or sovereign states around primary identities?  A nation for Christians, another for Muslims. One for Objectivists, another for Socialists, and yet another for welfare state capitalists. Should Ireland be re-united?  Doesn't Israel have a right to exist primarily for the Jews?

She is absolutely perfect for me. We're compatible on almost every level: spiritual, emotional, politically, background is similar, we have similar dreams for families ext. My problem comes down to the issue of attraction. I'm a very attractive man, probably an 8/10 and getting more attractive every year. She is probably a 5/10. Although she is perfect for me in every way, I can't help from having ‘wondering eyes’ and wanting to pursue other women (this is based purely on physicality). I do not do this because I know it is wrong, but still, the desire is there constantly. I want to pursue marriage with my girlfriend, but before I do, I need to know how to better fight this desire intrinsic desire in me, so I don't repeat the mistakes of my father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. and get divorce after I’m married.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [43:44] – “Due to the appalling decisions made by the UK's family court system I have had no contact with my son for over 9 years, a thing that grieves my heart bitterly. After contacting numerous other fathers, who also have been unjustly removed from their children's lives, we are convinced that the courts are biased against fathers in favor of mothers. We believe that child custody statistics support our contention, since overwhelmingly they suggest that mothers get a better deal than do we fathers from the court system. My questions are why do you think this is the case? And is there something mendacious going on that reaches far beyond the family court system and is a specific policy of our government to remove the role of fatherhood? If this is the case what is their plan?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:33:51] – “People mostly attribute a dictatorship to the extreme right. However, there seems to be a conflict of definition where for some, the right means 'free market &amp; liberty', and for others it means a fascist tyranny.  Could you help clarify the concepts of 'Left' and 'Right', why people don't agree on their definition and explain both extremes and how they may?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:54:56] – “What should we do to protect women from psycho alpha male predators? My sister made bad choices and I watched her crash. I watched my parents, especially my dad struggle with how to reach her. I tried to help her when I could, but she often rejected my help.  I have an 8-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter. I am demonstrating my love for my wife and building my relationship with my son and daughter. I am leading my family so that they understand what a good husband and father looks like. I am teaching my daughter to set expectations for her curfew so that she knows it is for her benefit. At around 16 I expect her to bring her date home so that I can have a conversation with him, my bat and shotgun in hand, and set ground rules for their time together. There are lines in our society that have changed and yet I believe like you that we must be the village elders that protect our family and other women from aggressive men and their own poor choices.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

More directly, how do you convince a laid off coal miner trying to make ends meet for his children to use free enterprise to better his lot when there's a politician ready to say, ‘Give me power, and I'll take money from the city and give it to you,’ especially if the future looks bleak to him? This comes from my anecdotal observation that leftists hate guns until an armed right winger saves their life from a mugger, and right wingers hate government until a left winger gives them government drip to tide them and their family over in a crisis.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [37:46] – “You have compared God to a mythical unicorn, in that the inability to empirically prove either's existence is a sign of nonexistence. The difference however is that God has a perceivable effect on the world and a unicorn does not. Love, courage and beauty are the chief examples that go beyond our biological queues and speak to something greater than nature. In the case of UPB, for behavior to be preferable that means there is behavior that is not preferable. But in nature there is no such thing as preferable or not preferable, just whether or not urges are satisfied and reproduction takes place. Doesn't our ability to discern between what is moral and immoral in a society and in ourselves speak to the effect God has on our world vs. the nonexistence of a unicorn?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [54:39] – “Though I'm fairly self-aware, in my relationship there are issues that are rooted in my own insecurities, the biggest issue being jealousy. I feel so jealous all the time because I feel inferior to other women (mostly physically), and this stresses me out in every way it possibly could. Not only do I already feel bad about myself because of how I am, but I also feel bad about the way that I treat my partner, because I never want him to stress about anything. I've gone so far as to avoid going out and participating in certain activities with him because I don't want to risk him being around a woman that would be more attractive than myself. Although I've listened in and gotten a few ideas as to why my mind functions this way, I can't feel confident enough in my reasoning to move forward and properly handle the issue. So, for the sake of my partnership, what is causing these insecurities and how do I use this knowledge to prevent the downfall of my love life?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:05:13] – “How do you feel about the general viewpoint of the west being the villain by trying to act as a cop and constantly financing the rebelling, more often than not terrorist fractions in countries like Syria, Iraq, and of Yugoslavia? There's a good portion of people on the Balkans who feel as if their countries are being colonized, mainly by Germany and the US, what are your thoughts on this form of brutal capitalism?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [2:20:15] – “The question I ask is not related only to Syrian refugees, but to all other less well-off people around the world in comparison to the western world: when is it acceptable to allow people to die in deplorable conditions?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I'm not sure how much I base my personal worth on other people's judgments; after all, virtually nobody else I know bases his/her personal worth on my judgments, and rightfully so.  In determining my personal worth, how much of it should be based on the opinions of others?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [36:07] – “I am having a crisis of what to do about my relationship with the black community.  While my family are certainly not full of Michael Browns and Trayvon Martins, they are excruciatingly liberal and completely intolerant of any other viewpoints.  The black community that rejected me long ago for ‘speaking and acting white’ now rebukes me for leaving the black community once I started making good money and reminds me that it is the responsibility of people like me to fix everything. It is time (way past time) for me to start creating children and what am I giving them?  What society am I giving my black children?  What burdens am I forcing upon them?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:30:06] – “On an previous call addressing a question about cultural homogeneity, you made the remark: ‘the only people who love diversity tend to be the young, who've got lots of time on their hands, and love (frankly) banging people from exotic cultures.’ Perhaps this is not your intention, but the remark comes across as an insult to some of my friends who are in inter-ethnic relationships because it suggests: (1) people who love diversity do so because of a fetish (‘banging people from exotic cultures’), and (2) that people seeking diversity are not productive or busy members of society (they ‘have lots of time on their hands’). Can you explain the reasoning behind the original remark?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:05:05] – “The human implicit memory mechanism relies on looking into the future. Since 99% of the human decision making process relies on implicit memories for survival, stereotyping is inevitable. Therefore, racism is inherent to human nature. Do you agree/disagree? What is the cause of Racism in humans? Not WHY we have racism, what specific mechanism that is the nature of humanity that causes all humans to have racism?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [2:42:31] – “How do we seek relationships that can be enriching instead of ending up with people who rely too much on you when the relationship gets 'too comfortable'?

You have values that seem to align with Christian views without the idea of being held accountable after you die. What makes you different?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [33:37] – “As a political fascist I believe in a regulated market. How does a proponent of the 'free market' justify the free market when it has been shown (mass) man is easily swayed by his desires, primitive urges, and passions; top that off with the reality of corporations willingness to take advantage of that fundamental reality no matter the cost to society or civilization.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:31:38] – “As a Chinese American who grew up in Hong Kong and in the California area. I have a unique perspective of the world. People in America don't usually view me as an American and people in China don't usually view me as full Chinese. My heart says I belong to both places equally since I have family (genetic and step) on both sides of the ocean. As I think about the future and having my own family, I'm confused with what to teach my child. I don't want my child to grow up only in America because of the general lack of values, manners, history and morality especially in the neighborhood I grew up in. There is no trust or common ground with random strangers in public. This is what my father was concerned about and he brought me back to Hong Kong to grow up first so I can learn and understand my heritage, the language, culture and values. I have peers who have lost all ties with the old country, know little of their heritage, and speak only in English. Am I supposed to follow the same footsteps of my father's if I want future posterity to not be lost with no identity, common understanding, and acceptance from peers?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:00:17] – “I am 27 years old. I am very successful in my career and life in general is pretty great for me. Many of my friends have had children and my brother and sister-in-law have a young daughter. At this point in time I really have no desire for a relationship or children. I have been watching a lot of Stefan's videos and I feel that if I wait too long to have children, I'll be missing out on something huge in life. 20 years from now, if my mindset changes, I'll feel regret, and it will be too late to change things. Knowing the divorce rate and the state of modern relationships, the risk and loss side of the equation vastly outweigh the benefits of having a family or children. If someone feels no desire for a relationship or children, is this something to try to fix? What can I tell myself to make the laborious, frustrating, and potentially painful process look more alluring?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I have been a stay-at-home mom for five years raising a hyper soon to be six year old boy and a kind four year old girl. As of last month our finances have become strained, and we unexpectedly are carrying two mortgages. Our plans to place both children in private school may have to be cancelled. My plan to only be at work while kids are at the school, may have to change to me working full time hours and kids moving from school to after care. I am very frugal with the money I spend; I feel my husband is more of a spender than I am, but there are certain expenses he is unwilling to cut. What more can I sacrifice to truly put my kids first? How can convey to my husband that we both don't need to be chasing finances, while finances are tight?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:11:20] – “I work for a supplier that deals in electronics selling to large manufacturers. Recently this year I was told by a corporate purchasing manager that there is nothing she can do to maintain our business relationship as my company is not woman owned or classified as a diversity supplier. My contacts with this company run into the thousands worldwide, and the director who I was speaking with has a great deal of unchecked power. The company is a technology company, and I have worked with many women over my 23-year career all of whom are professional and have not harbored the least scrap of negativity toward me in my work, and I assume are assets to their teams. This perhaps is the greatest challenge to me in my career, we can always get a new customer and shame on me for creating a living off a multi-million-dollar account having kept most of my eggs in one basket. What does a man who works for a white male owned company do when his best fortune 50 customer says we no longer want to work with you because the company you work for is not classified as a diversity source?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:44:09] – “I have laid out an argument that the concept of ‘identity’ is logically invalid or meaningless within the domain of human being.   I also have an argument that the contradiction of ‘identity’ is significant because it sets the conditions necessary for the initiation of violence against people; thus, violating the Non-Aggression Principle.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:13:45] – “I am a former Antifa-style anarchist. In 2011, I was part of the Occupy movement, but in 2016 I voted for Trump after a long and difficult intellectual journey from radical Leftism to Conservatism. My hope now is to help other people trapped in the Radical Left to de-hypnotize themselves.

Armed with this book, you will be empowered to speak truth to power, illuminate ignorance, shatter delusions and expose the dangerous sophists within your own life, and around the world.<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Far from preparing them for fulfilling relationships, viewing an endless stream of porn videos led to unexpected symptoms. Perhaps most surprisingly, for the first time in history erectile dysfunction was becoming a significant problem for young men."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"This led to one of the largest informal experiments in the history of science. Tens of thousands of people have tried abstaining from sexually stimulating material in a process they call ‘rebooting’. Many of them reported startling changes, from improved concentration and elevated mood to a greater capacity for real-life intimacy. Gary Wilson has listened to the stories of those who have tried giving up internet porn and related them to an account of how the reward system of the brain interacts with its environment. And now a growing body of research in neuroscience is confirming what these pioneers have discovered for themselves – internet pornography can be seriously addictive and damaging."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"In Your Brain on Porn Wilson provides a concise introduction to the phenomenon of internet porn addiction that draws on both first-person accounts and the findings of cognitive neuroscience. In a voice that is generous and humane, he also offers advice for those who want to stop using internet pornography."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Wilson is the author of “Your Brain on Porn: Internet Pornography and the Emerging Science of Addiction.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Book: http://www.fdrurl.com/yourbrainonporn&lt;br /&gt;Website: https://www.yourbrainonporn.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I had a private, Christian education from kindergarten through college, but I'm aware - thanks in big part to your show - that I did not learn to reason regarding current events and relationships. We want to start teaching our kids the basics of reason and philosophy now; how are you teaching your daughter about these things?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [18:45] - "Will we eventually have to go back in, with boots on the ground, to the countries - or failed states - in the Middle East, Afghanistan and elsewhere, whose problems we may not have created entirely but have certainly contributed to, in order to avert the existential threat we face in the West and also to deliver safe, civilized, worthwhile lives to the people living in these countries?

What drives me to put so much energy and time into those relationships?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:27:34] – “I am contemplating and leaning towards pursuing philosophy as a career path similar to how you do use it. Given that philosophy has such a large body of work to it, has traditionally been tied to college which is now so ideologically infected.

He's 27 and my sister is 20. We have the same ethnic background and I've known his parents for over 10 years. Initially I was alright with him, I found him a bit weird but I felt relief because I knew his parents well. As it currently stands, they've been in a relationship for 1 year. Throughout this time I've found him to be a very impulsive, superficial and fake person. I think he is a negative influence on my sister and dread contact with him. A virtue I value strongly is that of being a genuine and honest person. It's very easy for me to fake being friendly with him and avoid conflict but I don't like acting contrary to my true feelings. I was hoping you can give some insight on how one should behave with someone they dislike that they can't avoid.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [33:45] – “I've read and watched a lot of your content regarding atheism, and theism, but have yet to hear your views on the concept of the idea of an Aristotelian unmoved mover, especially with the surfacing scientific evidence that our universe had an absolute beginning. Is it not valid to use a deductive inference to the best explanation to conclude that a transcendental being created the universe?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:02:26] – “I have been listening to your podcasts for about 1 year and my husband has listened to some of them recently.  I have started reading real time relationships and am about half way through.  I have already been hit with many truths most of which are physically painful.  I am contacting you because I feel time is running short for our marriage and I cannot pretend anymore.  I have tried to speak with my husband many times about this but he avoids it and or doesn't understand what I mean.  I don't want to break up our children's home and damage them even more.   I have many regrets about the kind of mother I have been even though I swore I wouldn't be like mine.  My objective with contacting you is to try and minimize any further damage to my children and to survive my marriage.  There is no physical or verbal abuse in our marriage but we avoid everything that may bring a conflict.  It is fake.  To sum up our relationship you can substitute our names for ‘Bruce and Sheila’ in Real Time Relationships.  I know you can't tell us what to do but I feel you could give us or even just myself the kick in the ass we need. I know that we avoid any conflict because if we were really honest with each other and our families, everything we have would come crashing down.  This terrifies me.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:05:18] – “After 6 years of being an ‘empty nester’, I accepted the responsibility of helping my boyfriend raise his 13-year-old daughter.  She is 10 years younger than my daughter and came from the type of home I can only imagine but have a hard time truly understanding.  I come from a highly K-directed background (I grew up on a ranch in Wyoming, my parents are still married, and my father was in the military).  I am struggling with the obvious R characteristics displayed by my stepdaughter, and to some extent my boyfriend.  How can I help her overcome her early experiences and become a productive member of society?  She is now 14, do you believe there is a point when it is just ‘too late’?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

As Christians we are supposed to be concerned about the weakest among us and help them. I see a free market as a way to helping people -- and as the ultimate in ‘free will’ but he can't see past his belief that Capitalism exploits the poor. How do you convince another Christian that it is immoral to support a large government - because if takes away our ‘God Given’ free will? And what arguments can I use to show that a free society will not only restore ‘free will’ but will benefit the poor as well?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [46:16] – "I’m an ex-muslim middle eastern immigrant, I’ve noticed a lot of parallels in the rise of tyranny back home and the rise of tyranny in the west. Obviously, as I chose to be in the west now, this concerns me but not for my own sake. After attempting to relate these thoughts with others, whether those back home or my new neighbours, people are often skeptical of my observations. Despite watching things regress in the last few years to an obvious, almost painful, degree I feel like my observations are only getting more validated despite not earning legitimacy in the public sphere. A big aspect of this is having both the left and the right perceiving me as the other, the far right viewing me no different from those that seek to destroy the west and the far left viewing me no different than those that seek to discriminate against muslims, how do I reconcile this and earn my place in this shaky society? Is there no more room for nuance?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Over this time I’ve also come to realize the importance of balancing tradition but maintaining an open mind and I think both forms of societies have pros and cons. How can we redirect the conversation from eliminating the other side into synthesizing? The biggest catastrophe that has hit the west since WW2 in my estimation is the death of (and on-going war on) the family and it genuinely sadness me, on the other hand things are far too rigid back home and the concept of family can almost be suffocating."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:57:20] – “I am a public school teacher and a resident of the small city in which I teach. I am surrounded by liberals and leftists at work. There will be a new high school built in our city within the next two years, at the cost of about $75 million. There is a faction that looks at that pile of taxpayer money and would love to turn the new high school into a giant ‘sustainability’ project. What is the best way to push back against this faction without appearing rude, combative, or crazy?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:11:05] – “Last fall, one of my underage teenagers (male) was groomed and sexually assaulted by a(n) (female) employee of the local government school. Since reporting the felonies against my child to the police, the defendant/abuser's family and friends physically threatened my family, including death threats. Last week, my residence was burglarized and some guns were stolen. Since then, death threats have been issued at my family online. The police and district attorney have begun investigating the crimes, which resulted from reporting the sexual assaults. As of today my family is in the process of moving to a different county for safety. Do you think this is the rational course of action, considering the current state of affairs in the USA?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [2:45:07] – “Do you think it goes too far to say that we in America are far along a path demonstrating the evils of elite (not by-the-people) government, and that to reform, we need to treat lying almost as severely as murder, teach children not to lie (and not gently), require (even force) our politicians never to lie, and stop paying people to lie (through commercially-sponsored TV including news) or broadcast or film other messages that lie or encourage lying. And, do you anticipate if the coming recession or depression is bad enough, due to the lies of fiat money and fiscal deceit, America will embrace this in a restoration of morality.

With the suspect disabled, Engle is reported to have retrieved a legal firearm from his vehicle and guarded the shooter until police arrived on scene. Originally from Sudan, Emanuel Kidega Samson was brought to the United States in 1996 when he was only 5 years old. Samson is a legal United States resident, but not necessarily a U.S. citizen.

Bob Menendez Corruption Trial </title><description>New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and Dominican Republic born ophthalmologist Dr. Salomon Melgen were indicted on public corruption and bribery charges on April 1, 2015. Only two weeks later on April 15, Melgen was also indicted on Medicare fraud charges. At the center of the corruption trial is the long-standing mutually-beneficial relationship between Menendez and Melgen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez is the first United States senator on trial for corruption in 36 years and faces six counts of bribery, three counts of honest services fraud, one count of conspiracy, one count of interstate travel to carry out bribery, and one count of making false statements on his congressional financial disclosures to conceal the criminal activity. Melgen faces the same charges, except for the charge related to congressional financial disclosures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Menendez is convicted and forced out of office before January, current New Jersey Gov.

A Turkish Wizard Cast Magic Spells On Me! - Call In Show - October 4th, 2017</title><description>Question 1: [2:10] – “I am a first-year college student attending one of the more esteemed Christian colleges in the United States. My college is in what we all usually consider the "Bible belt" of America, and generally I figured that would imply people would tend to share my perspective as a more conservative Christian (While also being a Conservative Populist politically, myself). While I have met several people that seem to share my distaste for the violence and sheer insanity of SJW culture in today's society, it almost seems like it's been embraced by quite a number of students. Sometimes I feel quite alone as a young man that holds to Christian tradition and the word of the Bible while the administration veers subtly more Left with every week I stay here. I know that God wants me here for some purpose, but how do I keep my sanity or even push back against this seeping cancer of Social Justice into my religion? How does one separate true Christianity from the influences of Social Justice, and what can I do practically as a pastor-in-training to root out those influences?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:00:01] – “When I was little, I have clear memories of being very young (toddler or just after) making up stories. I went on to draw pictures and create more and more elaborate stories. Then, when I was 10, Star Wars came out and my dad had died a couple years before. My mom, feeling guilty, or just out of unconditional love, she bought me tons of the associated action figures and vehicles. At that point, I pretty much slowly moved into my imagination. I had two lives, one in my head with a cast of characters and all kinds of amazing heroic stories and situations, and the other real one that basically went through the motions with. At any point, I can just sit there and go off into my imagination. It’s easy to do and fun. However, the people I should have a better connection to are suffering. When things get stressful, I essentially leave to a place I have complete control over. I’ve gone to a therapist, and that’s helped. But I simply can’t seem to leave my imagination and be as present as I should.

My college is in what we all usually consider the "Bible belt" of America, and generally I figured that would imply people would tend to share my perspective as a more conservative Christian (While also being a Conservative Populist politically, myself). While I have met several people that seem to share my distaste for the violence and sheer insanity of SJW culture in today's society, it almost seems like it's been embraced by quite a number of students. Sometimes I feel quite alone as a young man that holds to Christian tradition and the word of the Bible while the administration veers subtly more Left with every week I stay here. I know that God wants me here for some purpose, but how do I keep my sanity or even push back against this seeping cancer of Social Justice into my religion? How does one separate true Christianity from the influences of Social Justice, and what can I do practically as a pastor-in-training to root out those influences?”<br /><br />Question 2: [1:00:01] – “When I was little, I have clear memories of being very young (toddler or just after) making up stories. I went on to draw pictures and create more and more elaborate stories. Then, when I was 10, Star Wars came out and my dad had died a couple years before. My mom, feeling guilty, or just out of unconditional love, she bought me tons of the associated action figures and vehicles. At that point, I pretty much slowly moved into my imagination. I had two lives, one in my head with a cast of characters and all kinds of amazing heroic stories and situations, and the other real one that basically went through the motions with. At any point, I can just sit there and go off into my imagination. It’s easy to do and fun. However, the people I should have a better connection to are suffering. When things get stressful, I essentially leave to a place I have complete control over. I’ve gone to a therapist, and that’s helped. But I simply can’t seem to leave my imagination and be as present as I should. My wife and kids need a full-time husband and dad, and while I understand that, this habit is hard to break."<br /><br />Question 3: [2:09:26] – “Is spell casting ethical?

On one side, I have: Common American culture which has been working, for the most part, for quite a while which includes what they like to call corporal punishment.

When I talk about child abuse with someone who does have a child, I have a clear disadvantage and my views are immediately discounted because I do not yet have children.  Honestly, it is not my goal to convince them to stop beating their children, it is my goal to come to a clear conclusion myself.  What can we say to those many parents who dismiss me when I speak against child abuse?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:09:40] – “I’m a student at my local Community College.

However, there are a shocking number that simply frustrate me by refusing to speak English in public or even refrain from doing so when in classroom discussions around me. My mother also has co-workers that frustrate her by speaking Spanish around her and excluding her from their conversations. Should these people not, at the very least, do us native born people the courtesy of speaking English and treating us with common courtesy?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:25:27] – “For the last six years I have been a part of something called the "Furry Fandom".

I've done a fair bit of research on this myself, and while I certainly can't dispute this conclusion, I would be lying to you if I did not wonder to exactly what extent my own current personality traits were genetic, as opposed to being shaped by my environment and upbringing.  I look back at how I grew up, and I believe I've done a fairly decent job of piecing together how certain events in my youth shaped me into who I am today. While I may take pride in certain aspects of who I am, there are also certain parts of my personality that I feel I need to work on, to improve; I honestly feel these negative personality traits are holding me back, in many ways, from living a successful and fulfilling life.  But if our personality is largely genetic, is there any point in trying to change or improve certain aspects of it?  Am I doomed to be a slave to my own DNA, or can these obstacles be overcome?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [27:49] – “It seems an inevitable trend in culture for men and women to continue to separate into what looks like a clear fact/value split. This complicates and most likely prevents the potential for healing between the sexes. I have been working to understand the history and reasoning behind feminism and discouraged to find men and women growing more distant from one another. In light of these facts, how likely do you see a return for men to their traditional roles, where they are "drawn back into family life...convinced that being a good husband and father is a manly thing to do; that parental duty and sacrifice are masculine virtues; that marital love and fidelity are not female standards imposed upon men externally, but an integral part of the male character--something inherent and original?" What would it take for men to realize and live out this truth?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:11:42] – “By definition, the atheistic worldview believes that all life is the product of natural forces. But with the discovery of DNA as a source of human genetic code, how can it be argued that the information that makes us up is purely natural, considering that information is independent of matter? And how can it be argued that life was made by nature when the components to make life are irreducibly complex?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:47:44] – “After listening to your show with Dr. Adam Perkins, it seems to me that my daughter may fall into the category of people who have an employment-resistance personality.  She is 16 years old, and throughout her life I've struggled with how to parent her affectively.  Now that she's quickly approaching age 18, I worry that all my efforts will be for naught, and she will inevitably end up like her father's side of the family, dependent on others or the state.  (she seems to share a lot of their genetic traits) Can you lend me some insight/advice about how to combat or curb these personality traits before it's too late?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [2:52:39] – “In a recent talk titled ‘The Harvey Weinstein Scandal: Aftermath’ you mentioned the idea of everyone having a documentary and a fantasy in their head with the fantasy being an ideal to strive for but if you just focus on the fantasy and live there, the documentary decays. In light of the Weinstein scandal, can't we say that Hollywood is using the fantasy to excuse their own behavior rather than create an ideal to strive for, which explains why they celebrate the churning out of Naturalistic movies and attack and decry the production of Romantic ones?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

When I confront him about the lies, he tells me that he will stop and it won't happen again however continues to do so. He says he doesn't know why he can't stop. He tells me that he lies because he feels inadequate (which has a lot to do with his upbringing) and doesn't want to lose me. I myself have a fear of intimacy and have trouble letting my guard down. It makes me highly uncomfortable sharing my feelings and letting him know how much I care for him. I feel like it gives him "power" over me. I think this will only exacerbate his feelings of inadequacy and we will be stuck in this cycle. I know this is something I need to work on. Even though these are little white lies, should I be concerned? What should I think of him when he promotes honesty as a virtue yet continues to lie? I have been honest throughout our relationship and expect him to do the same. Am I looking too far into this, or is this a detrimental clash of values?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [56:04] - “Are 3 moral rules generally sufficient to define 'morality' and govern a free and just society? 1) don't steal (respect the fruit of labor - i.e. property), 2) don't lie (keep your word - i.e. contracts), 3) don't initiate aggression against others (don't murder, rape, assault, etc.), and does such morality only apply to conscious life?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:11:21] - “I just finished Stefan's book The Art of the Argument on Audible and I thoroughly enjoyed it and I appreciate such a much needed work for today's moral and ethical decay.  In the book, Stefan expresses the importance of committing one's self to reason and evidence, which I cannot agree more.  Sophistry is a disease that is rotting the foundation of society.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I see a dilemma in this crusade against sophistry:  when communicating, people, in general, rarely connect purely on an intellectual, logical and rational level.  In all my education, training, and book-reading in the 11 years of my adult life, I've learned that to truly connect with people, you do need to appeal not only to their Logos (logic), but also to their Pathos (emotions) and when necessary to their Ethos (ethics/values).  If we ignore this advice, we run the risk of alienating our audience, an error Jimmy Carter made when running against Ronald Reagan.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I believe this may be a topic missed in the Art of the Argument.  I would like to ask Stefan how he would propose to connect with people while giving a sound argument that is presented in a way that does not rub people the wrong way and alienate them.  How could we modulate our Logos arguments on a Pathos and Ethos carrier signal (using signal communications terms) so that we may connect with people on the deepest levels and be more effective in expressing The Argument?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:16:15] - “At age 18 I started dating a 26-year-old man, and we've been together for the last 6 years. We have never lived together. Do not share finances. And do not see each other except a few days a week. I love this man and want the 6 years we've spent together to have been worth it, but he's told me that he has no interest in every being married and has changed his position from wanting 10 kids to never having kids. He identifies with the MGTOW movement and although he will acknowledge I am a good, loyal woman, he still thinks that NAWALT is a myth and that all women will eventually turn into a AWALT. He is the person who introduced me to Ayn Rand, FDR, and objectivism - so it breaks my heart that he sees no value in family or partnership. Living in a society where women use and abuse men through our current legal system has created the MGTOW movement. My life goal is marriage and children, but my partner see's these things as surrendering his freedom and property rights. How do I as a woman prove to my partner that NAWALT and that I would never "screw him over" or use the broken legal system against him. Women have far more power that we should, but that doesn’t mean my values will ever let me screw over a man. How do I prove my values and show that I am wife material?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [1:37:54] – “My wife divorced me because she fell in love with a mutual friend, and after almost two years, they are now moving in together and the man is increasingly involved in the lives of my two daughters.  How can I bring myself to resolve my lingering, intense resentment and animosity towards a person whom I thought was my friend but played a part in breaking up my family?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 6: [2:38:13] – “I am an engineering student and am required to take a class about social advocacy and ethics. My instructor has been pushing a lot of anti-capitalism sentiments and pro-Marxist arguments and I was wondering if you could help me understand these arguments as they don't make a lot of sense to me; since I study engineering I don't have much of a background in philosophy or economics. 1) The idea that capitalism operates under exploitation, such as how a wage earner must produce more than they are paid and the employer gets to keep the excess, thus the laborer is exploited. There's a sort of subservience, my instructor argues, that is inherent in wages which is part of this exploitative system. 2) There's this idea of a Repressive State Apparatus(RSA), that the state uses various institutions to reinforce the ideas of exploitation on its populace. This is accompanied by the idea that the population has to be compliant and subservient to the capitalist system that exploits them.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

My instructor has been pushing a lot of anti-capitalism sentiments and pro-Marxist arguments and I was wondering if you could help me understand these arguments as they don't make a lot of sense to me; since I study engineering I don't have much of a background in philosophy or economics. 1) The idea that capitalism operates under exploitation, such as how a wage earner must produce more than they are paid and the employer gets to keep the excess, thus the laborer is exploited. There's a sort of subservience, my instructor argues, that is inherent in wages which is part of this exploitative system. 2) There's this idea of a Repressive State Apparatus(RSA), that the state uses various institutions to reinforce the ideas of exploitation on its populace. This is accompanied by the idea that the population has to be compliant and subservient to the capitalist system that exploits them.”<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Knowing you have a background in software entrepreneurship, I’d like to know how important your business experience was to shaping your philosophy regarding the importance of having purpose.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [24:46] – "I consistently hear you extol the virtues of the free market while you rail against the excesses of the state. My personal experience in working inside of a wide sampling of both agencies of the state and various international banking institutions has shown the reverse to be true in practice. To what degree is systemic corruption applied, valued, or discounted in anarcho-capitalist ideologies?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [45:23] – “I was born in 1951, and that entitles me to the Boomer label, I am told. I am mystified as to why you speak so scathingly about this demographic. Could you expand on this for me, just so I understand this bias for my own future reference when it comes at me personally? I bring this up because, like many free-thinkers, I do not own what others assume about me, and it might be fun to talk with you, as a voice from outside the categories and statistics which you may or may not be referring to. I am also aware that your childhood traumas come from a mother who is probably a Boomer, so that explains the emotions I hear in your voice when you blame the Boomers for most of the ills of the world. For this, I have compassion. You are free to ask me anything about my childhood, my birthing and raising of children, my marriage, my post-menopausal reality, my livelihood(s), my political, spiritual, philosophical views. Perhaps you would agree that I am not really worthy of the Boomer label, except for my age, which I can do nothing about, nor feel ashamed of. A conversation about being old might be helpful for you too!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:29:09] – “Me and my fiancée have been together seven years and have two children. We love each other very much and have a great relationship but I have a sneaking paranoia that the trauma of our childhoods is boiling under the surface and threaten to spill over onto our children. I guess the crux of the issue is determinism. My fiancée and I are both from a long line of broken families from an Indian reservation. Has the multi-generational failure of our ancestors to maintain stable family units, imprinted to deep upon us the self-destructive urge to break our family apart? I believe that we all have free will but has the joining of our hundreds of years of combined nature and nurture towards brokeness created conditions that make it improbable for our family to succeed?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

How would one value one versus the other and use both advantageously without rubbishing the discussion like it´s done so frequently, when one uses the identity argument to silence and shame the other, or – to try and see the flaws in both sides – one uses statistics and empirical knowledge to invalidate or explain away a lived personal or group experience?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 6: [2:32:19] – “I am afraid to have a child with a woman and have her leave from boredom thus separating the family.

She's been struggling with depression on and off for the past five or so years. I worry that she is becoming dependent on therapy. There was a time when I reprimanded her and she kept her distance from me for a good six to twelve months. I am afraid of rejection from her. I want to be able to get through to her without her cutting me off. While trying to help her, I asked her to make a five-year plan. She said she'd like to be moved out of our parents home and in a long-term relationship. I worry that as a feminist and as someone who constantly needs to have her feelings affirmed, she is not going to be able to find a high-quality partner. How can I be a good influence on my younger sister?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [57:02] – “1 in 3 young adults 18 to 34-year-olds live with their parents. Amongst them, 1 in 4 are not working or studying. More young people are valuing education over financial independence. Many graduates return back home. I myself have made poor decisions by dropping out of University twice. I'm heavily reliant on my parents and low in motivation. You criticize individuals who rely on state benefits. But what about adults who rely on their parents, aka: parental benefits? Sure, it is voluntary money, but are the good intentions of parents depriving young adults from reaching financial independence?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:57:09] – “I am a housewife and mother to a two-year-old boy and an six months pregnant with a girl and would love any advice you may have regarding bedtime. I'd like to know how I can determine when my son is cognitively ready to fall asleep in his room alone. Our background is I would breastfeed my son to sleep and then put him in his bed and would sleep next to him if I were too tired to move back to my own bed. At 22 months he began naturally to sleep through the night and I have moved back to my bed permanently. I have decided to stop breastfeeding today because my goal was a minimum of two years (he turned two at the end of November) and it is too painful since becoming pregnant and the past two nights I've become resentful. I've been trying for months to help him fall asleep peacefully without the breast and do not want to resort to strategies like letting him ‘cry it out’. I practice peaceful parenting and do not want to force him into being independent too early or coddle him when it comes to sleep.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:47:29] – “The Mainstream Media's audiences are dwindling nowadays. However, there has been an uptick in comedians pushing propaganda. I call this ‘comeganda’. In the category of ‘comegandists’ I include Jon Stewart and his pupils like John Oliver as well as others like Bill Maher and Jimmy Kimmel. These people have become the brain of the liberal millennial. Countering these comegandists has been tricky. Whenever questioned the ‘comegandists’ play the ‘I'm just a comedian card. Also their watchers are often stubborn, snarky, and unable to engage in debate. In addition, comeganda is short and uses comedy so it lures in low attention span millennials like a creepy old man offering kids candy. How can we counter this? Should we debunk their arguments? Should we ridicule them? Or should we make ‘comeganda’ of our own by blending humor and politics?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Essentially fellow students, as well as other Miamians, have started widely referring to the Cubans of my Grandfather's generation, those who fled the Castro regime, and their children as 'gusanos' (Gusano meaning worm in English). They have also referred to their experience as 'immigrant light' because their immigration to this country was legal and that they weren't on the receiving end of 'racism.' The reason this is so appalling to me is that the term 'gusano' is actually the communist propaganda of the Castro Regime meant to create a divide among Cubans and discredit those who left. I have had my family attacked on social media for being educated, hard-working immigrants and told that they were most likely Batista sympathizers or worse. The authenticity of Cubans, especially ones who originally fled the Castro regime, as latinos and as immigrants is being questioned more and more which I believe to be mainly because they are widely Conservative. I am proud of my family and their achievements, accomplished despite their many obstacles, so I refuse to have their good name tarnished by today's community that is hell bent against those who are conservative. However, I worry that if I were to go on the offensive on this issue I could lose the scholarships I've worked so hard to earn if my University found out. What can I do to fight this intelligently and without bringing myself down to the whining, complaining nature of the left?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:18:11] – “In your proposition Christianity is Epistemologically indefensible, are you referring to both models of epistemology: Foundationalism and Coherentism? Or are you basing your proposition solely on Christian apologists that argue from a foundationalist model of epistemology?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [2:11:30] – “The reason I write you today is because after watching your video on why the left always wins I found myself in thought about the many times I have won these arguments.  Our mentality of using victim hood and whining about how things are not fair is never a winning argument. As men shouldn't we be pushing other men to be stronger and more honorable?  Instead of looking at the world as victims of our circumstances shouldn't we be teaching other men how to conquer and not complain?  I feel like focusing on what we can't do or how things should be we should be teaching men to eat past it and not worry about what happened to them in the past or their circumstances now.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:39:03] – “I’m living with a lot of regret lately in my professional and financial life, as well as my personal relationships and political involvements. How can I overcome the pain of lost opportunities and sunk costs, and instead of dwelling on what could've been, use my experience over the past decade of poor choices to avoid repeating my history and compounding the difficulties in life I'm experiencing today? I'd like to define and make a distinction between nostalgia and regret: nostalgia being a fond reminiscence or sentimental longing for past life moments, whereas regret is the pain in acknowledging poor choices that have resulted in a disconnect between the reality I’m living and the reality that could have been or should be.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I have lived in low-income, high-crime African American communities since birth (with very few exceptions), and during college I voluntarily lived in such a neighborhood and babysat for single mothers while also spending time with gang members. During this same time, I also underwent a radical shift away from and rejection of leftist identity politics and social justice dogma, and I ended up doing my senior thesis on gang violence and family dissolution. How can we make libertarian values of ‘rugged individualism’ and private enterprise seem more attractive to people at the low end of the socioeconomic distribution, and black Americans in particular (especially those that have been trained to pursue government-funded subsistence)? Also, how can we simultaneously incentivize and promote family formation in the service of these goals?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [40:31] – “You've hired people, but you would hesitate to hire people today who have lost momentum. You've said that you would hesitate to hire people with college degrees, but you are aware of how weak the job market is. You're aware of the potential for discrimination for being white, so; your solution to all this is to ‘go be an entrepreneur’? Could you explain how this is done? What, in your mind, is an entrepreneur and how can a person suddenly become one with no capital and an unfortunate (in today's society) skin color?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:11:09] – “Does being in the position where you either need, or believe you need someone, make it harder to authentically love them? Be it God, or an actual person, does necessity tend to breed contempt?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:29:47] – “My friend and I both work in the emergency medical services, I recently had a discussion with him on the topic of anarchy. My friend is a self-proclaimed anarchist and believes that the government is fundamentally illegitimate: taxation is theft, government is immoral, the usual anarchist talking points. I’m as far right as I can be without being an anarchist, call me a libertarian. We recently had a discussion on the non-aggression principle and how it relates to EMS function in society. He recently got a job at a public ems provider, tax payer funded. When I asked him how this affects his beliefs on the non-aggression principle he couldn’t quite defend it. The conversation ultimately evolved into me saying he’s not an anarchist to which he said that he still is- I again reminded him that his entirely bi-weekly pay check was courtesy of my working parents and neighbors who had no say in funding this ems provider. Bottom line, my question is, can someone still be a an anarchist and voluntarily work for a company that thrives off of the initiation of force?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 5: [2:06:01] – “I am a depressed 25 year old woman who has a history of dating and being attracted to closeted gay men and men who are otherwise taken.  I am diagnosed as depressive, anxious, and as a vacillator. I am painfully aware of how often I get taken advantage of. I am unable to speak up for myself and instead focus on pleasing others leading me to getting burnt out emotionally and unable to focus on my own wants and needs.

Socrates concluded that a necessary condition of the philosopher — as one who ‘loves wisdom’ — is being separated from the wisdom he seeks. He therefore makes a distinction between the philosopher and the sage, the latter being someone who has attained wisdom, having embodied the ideal he/she espouses. Does this suggest that the ideal road of philosophy ends at sagacity? If so, do you consider yourself a philosopher or a sage, and why?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:03:17] – “I'm 24 years old. When I was 18 years old, I went through a traumatic experience where I watched 5 people die at the scene of a car accident, including 3 close friends. I grew up a lot since then and now work a full-time job where I directly interact with injuries and car accidents. Now, when someone asks what I do for a living or why I picked this career I will tell them honestly about the car accident. This must throw up red flags because anytime I tell someone they either get distant or become less interested romantically. I'm wondering when in a relationship with a high-value partner would be the appropriate time and way to tell this story or if my choosing a career related to this is the problem.? Does a traumatic event make someone a higher liability for a relationship? Is a traumatic event in the past something that should shape someone's future IE career path or life purpose?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [2:15:11] – “I am a 50-year old woman in Sweden that has been listening for two years now. I have made most things wrong in my life; I had four children with a man who developed a serious mental disorder that crept upon us, left him, shared custody with my children with him (…) not totally understanding his problems and when my children with him reached adult age, I kind of felt released from being afraid tragedy would strike. I am remarried and have a little boy with a very stable and successful man. Things were looking up, then tragedy struck when my 25-year old daughter committed suicide this August. I heard the call in show with the British girl who was living with her parents and I felt the urge to address the way she shrugged off any thoughts of her family when behaving suicidal. I believe my actions have had a great deal of influence in my daughter’s misery. I did not understand that she was depressed, she lived with her boyfriend and she always acted as if things were great when we talked. I wanted her to come home and the few last times we talked she said ‘Soon, mum. I miss you so.’ I always flattered myself with thinking me and my children had such great contact, they could always talk to me I felt. Now I understand that I got it all wrong.

Socrates concluded that a necessary condition of the philosopher — as one who ‘loves wisdom’ — is being separated from the wisdom he seeks. He therefore makes a distinction between the philosopher and the sage, the latter being someone who has attained wisdom, having embodied the ideal he/she espouses. Does this suggest that the ideal road of philosophy ends at sagacity? If so, do you consider yourself a philosopher or a sage, and why?”<br /><br />Question 2: [1:03:17] – “I'm 24 years old. When I was 18 years old, I went through a traumatic experience where I watched 5 people die at the scene of a car accident, including 3 close friends. I grew up a lot since then and now work a full-time job where I directly interact with injuries and car accidents. Now, when someone asks what I do for a living or why I picked this career I will tell them honestly about the car accident. This must throw up red flags because anytime I tell someone they either get distant or become less interested romantically. I'm wondering when in a relationship with a high-value partner would be the appropriate time and way to tell this story or if my choosing a career related to this is the problem.? Does a traumatic event make someone a higher liability for a relationship? Is a traumatic event in the past something that should shape someone's future IE career path or life purpose?”<br /><br />Question 3: [2:15:11] – “I am a 50-year old woman in Sweden that has been listening for two years now. I have made most things wrong in my life; I had four children with a man who developed a serious mental disorder that crept upon us, left him, shared custody with my children with him (…) not totally understanding his problems and when my children with him reached adult age, I kind of felt released from being afraid tragedy would strike. I am remarried and have a little boy with a very stable and successful man. Things were looking up, then tragedy struck when my 25-year old daughter committed suicide this August. I heard the call in show with the British girl who was living with her parents and I felt the urge to address the way she shrugged off any thoughts of her family when behaving suicidal. I believe my actions have had a great deal of influence in my daughter’s misery. I did not understand that she was depressed, she lived with her boyfriend and she always acted as if things were great when we talked. I wanted her to come home and the few last times we talked she said ‘Soon, mum. I miss you so.’ I always flattered myself with thinking me and my children had such great contact, they could always talk to me I felt. Now I understand that I got it all wrong. It is painful to realize how my actions in the past echoes in the now and the future. I can`t bring my girl to life again but maybe I can wake some other parent up.”<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Stefan goes on to say ‘Do Bernie Madoffs Children get to keep the profits of his Ponzi scheme? Well, no, I mean, it all has to go back.’ I’d like to ask Stef, who truly owns America? The reason the answer to this question is important to me is that when discussing this topic in my personal life I often find myself unclear of how the European colonialist settlers have a valid claim to America when they acquired the land through initiating coercion against the indigenous people who were already here. I believe that clarifying the truth on this matter will help to bring unity between individuals and create a greater incentive to refrain from using the force of the government to resolve the cultural and political conflicts that are still present in our present society.

I feel like I have to hold the door open for her.  It's just someone else's needs before mine, as my needs from childhood were so marginalized. They get what they want while not even trying. I look at women who have their men taking care of them with such jealousy and anger. I want a man to do that for me and not feel like I'm a burden for them or troubling them. I used to beat myself up emotionally for wanting that. I even so much wanted to be a boy so I could be looked at as strong, that I could take care of myself.  Or to make myself feel better I would be like the woman who has her man taking care of her can't get the money and is ditsy or is manipulating men cause they turn on the stupid when men are around.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It's a torrent of thoughts and emotions, like I'm not pretty enough or that I don't take care of myself enough. I always have dirt under my fingernails. At times when I embrace my femininity I feel in alignment with the truest part of myself. But I worry because work in my mind takes the back burner. I loose my work ethic and all I want is babies and a peaceful tidy home. How do I be so great he can't say no? I am a 29 year old woman who has grown up in the wreckage of third wave feminism. I wish to be more feminine but I despise and am jealous of woman who are. I have been made to carry heavy burdens. If I fully embrace my femininity will I loose my drive, logic, reason and motivation? And how do I become more feminine?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:54:30] - “I am a 27 year old female, and my partner of 4 years wants to have children in the next few years. I am committed to him and have no plans to jump ship, but I have deep misgivings about the idea of having children. I was raised in a very isolated and dysfunctional environment by a chronically ill single mother, who herself was severely abused and neglected in her youth. I am deeply aware I am not cut out to be a mother - I am utterly terrified I will unintentionally and unexpectedly behave the way that my mom did. I couldn't live with myself if I screwed up a child. Through listening to the show, I do take seriously what you have said about committed women approaching their 30s needing to think seriously about children, but every time I do, I go cold with terror. Please help, even if for my partner's sake, as I do not want him to waste his life or be put in a terrible position if I turn out to be unfit for motherhood.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Tickets are now available, and we look forward to seeing everybody there! http://www.anightforfreedomdc.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 1: [0:55] – "I'm a 27-year-old male who listens to Stefan's content regularly.  One of the points I disagree with him on is the role of parenthood, and I believe that I'll be happiest if I never have any kids of my own.  I've taken measures to make sure that I won't reproduce including getting a vasectomy at the age of 23.   I expect to continue living my life with happiness, value, and purpose, and I don't think that I will regret my choice to remain childfree.  However, my mind is open to the possibility that I might be wrong.  If a person is capable of having children but chooses not to, are his chances of having a happy and meaningful life truly diminished?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:23:49] – “I’m a 20-year-old who is currently a sophomore in college in the US. I've had very good upbringing with very little to no abuse. My father is in the 1% of yearly income and I am extremely well off. Most of my expenses (rent, groceries, college tuition, etc.) are currently being paid for by my parents. I'm grateful that they do this for me and I can see that having them as benefactors enables me to have more free time to obtain new knowledge and skills, as well as save the money I do earn. However, I've had the nagging thought that by accepting their help, I'm hindering my own potential growth by living in such a soft and orderly environment. I understand that many parents want to create a better life for their child they never had for themselves. My grandfather worked to give my father more resources to utilize than he ever had growing up. My father works hard to provide me with even more resources to utilize than he ever had growing up. Is the transference of an increasing abundance of resources from one generation to the next really a keystone piece of creating and optimizing a great life for the next of kin, or does this abundance of resources hinder the progress of the next of kin by failing preparing them for the real world?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [2:20:30] – “I have been married to a man for almost 7 years. I believe I may have entered my gay marriage because of a deep fear and mistrust of women. I found an ease of connection and brotherhood with my best friend that I possibly used to feed my own narcissism in our gay relationship. I believe I also felt an unwillingness to step into the deepest corners of my mental basement to work on foundational aspects of my history. I am deeply saddened that I have stolen seven years of my husband’s life in opportunity loss to find a truly gay lifetime partner, and I fear that I will not be able to surmount twenty-eight years of dysfunction with women of my past to build a virtuous marriage with a wife and children in the future. I have always had sexual attraction to women, and I have dated women, including a largely physical, two-year relationship with one. Please help me to unpack this foundational problem so that I can overcome my fear and move toward the best life for myself, my husband, and a potential future wife and children. I hope that my experience may also be a learning opportunity for others who may be confusing a lack of healthy male connection and a mistrust of women for homosexuality.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

However, by the time our daughter was born, we had already broken up a few times. Eventually we did get back together, but again, we broke up. Early last year, we finally got back together, which was supposed to be the "last attempt", and things were fine for the first half of last year. And then we broke up for different reasons than my infidelity last summer, mainly revolving around communication issues, which had always plagued us. Now, once again, I feel like maybe there is a chance we can get back together, if I were to really pursue it. There is a part of me that wants to be a good man and make our young family whole again, as my ex-girlfriend is pregnant with our second and due in a few months. But I also feel like I'm not ready to settle down still. I still have a part of me that wants to ‘sow my oats,’ so to speak. And I have the unfortunate feeling that we won't work out no matter how much I have this vision in my head of this perfect family. I feel divided 50/50, and it doesn't seem to be getting better with time. What should I do?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:22:37] – “Growing up in an abusive household with two alcoholic parents I have made most of my life about not being them. Though I fell into alcohol abuse myself I quit drinking and started therapy four years ago. This created a radical change in my life mentally, physically, and socially. Through therapy I had to ask myself this question: If most of my choices have been made in an effort to not be someone then who am I? My life, today, is the polar opposite of what it was just four years ago in a positive way, but I still struggle with that question.  Am I truly myself or just a reaction to someone else? Is identity just a collection of impressions others made upon you?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:50:03] – “I'm afraid that now that I've developed such a very scientific/debunker mind over the last 10 years, totally separate from my faith, I'm honestly afraid to even approach the subject but feel an intellectual urge to do so.  To put it simply - I'm afraid to look at it for fear that my Christian faith will go away like my previous strong beliefs (conspiracy, JFK, UFOs, etc.) and I will become an Atheist - which is not to say that I have any problem with Atheists/Agnostics. I'm basically at a crossroads and suffering with this decision on whether or not to review my faith. Is 100% preserving my faith (by not looking into it) worth it? Or is being 100% intellectually honest and risking a troublesome outcome better?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:32:57] – “I’m a nihilist. This simply means I see no true meaning to life. To have meaning would seem to suggest a purpose granted by something far more intelligent entity than ourselves. I believe, instead of saying we have meaning, that we rather have a function as a species. That function is simply to continue breeding and progressing the species. It’s naturally what we do, as all other animals. Do you believe we could ever achieve a world of nihilist and still progress as a species? Or, must religion always maintain that push toward the ‘function of our species?’”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Or is being 100% intellectually honest and risking a troublesome outcome better?”<br /><br />Question 4: [2:32:57] – “I’m a nihilist. This simply means I see no true meaning to life. To have meaning would seem to suggest a purpose granted by something far more intelligent entity than ourselves. I believe, instead of saying we have meaning, that we rather have a function as a species. That function is simply to continue breeding and progressing the species. It’s naturally what we do, as all other animals. Do you believe we could ever achieve a world of nihilist and still progress as a species? Or, must religion always maintain that push toward the ‘function of our species?’”<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

How can you distinguish this type of behavior between the natural law of ‘if you conform to my contract I will continue to be your friend. If you deviate from this contract I will not.’ How are they different? He terminates the friendship because they have not fulfilled his contract and they terminate the friendship because he has not fulfilled there’s. Am I missing something?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [32:14] – "What is the reason or evidence which convinces you of the existence of 'free will', and, if you were to trace a single human (just for example) decision back to its origins neurologically, what exactly *is* the thing which generates an 'axis of freedom' orthogonal-in-cause from all other known (or even unknown, but of which you'd admit to be classically constrained) types of causal interaction, and where exactly does it enter into the chain of otherwise-constrained events which we would call "deterministic"?  This, I believe, and if I've modeled your worldview correctly, must be the fundamental crux of your purported difference between human cognition and the mere "data processing", with which you hand-wave away modern and future advancements in 'artificial' intelligence.  If you cannot answer these simple questions with the same standard of rationality and evidence that you otherwise demand, then what is the difference between your belief in 'free will' and any other mystical belief?  Lastly, if you were to entertain that 'free will' is a bogus concept, then all organic cognitive apparatus would be reduced to very sophisticated computers and removed from the unconstrained will, rather than AI being an attempt to do the opposite; In that case, how would you believe your models of awareness, meaning, and morality, would have to change to accommodate this fundamental fact?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:45:55] – “I was raised in a conservative Christian home, but as an adult have rejected the faith of my parents.  I have noticed that these recent years have seen many Christians embrace leftist ideals such as letting in more refugees while battling non-existent racism.  Other Christians have gotten tired and disengaged from politics altogether with a ‘Lord Jesus come soon’ attitude.  White Christian America is under attack, and I am angry to see it, but has Christianity not made the West vulnerable to exploitation but pushing a gospel of grace and forgiveness instead of loyalty to kin and country?  As white people everywhere are asked to give more of their money and more space in their countries to second and third world immigrants and refugees, does Christianity really provide the backbone to protect ourselves from this invasion, or does it ask for too much grace to be extended to outside people groups?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:33:29] – “I posit that holding on to traumas perpetrated on us is the logical consequence to the inability/unwillingness to forgive ... the need to exact reparations, revenge, perceived justice (which really cannot ever be actually or satisfactorily realized in the case of these terrible abuses) and to somehow ‘right’ the wrong will never leave us as long as we (to milk the analogy) withhold the forgiveness of the debt. It has at least been my experience that until we stop expecting to be "reimbursed" and move on, our own personal happiness (and functionality) is mightily impacted. I think it would be really interesting to work through the philosophy of forgiveness.

This, I believe, and if I've modeled your worldview correctly, must be the fundamental crux of your purported difference between human cognition and the mere "data processing", with which you hand-wave away modern and future advancements in 'artificial' intelligence.  If you cannot answer these simple questions with the same standard of rationality and evidence that you otherwise demand, then what is the difference between your belief in 'free will' and any other mystical belief?  Lastly, if you were to entertain that 'free will' is a bogus concept, then all organic cognitive apparatus would be reduced to very sophisticated computers and removed from the unconstrained will, rather than AI being an attempt to do the opposite; In that case, how would you believe your models of awareness, meaning, and morality, would have to change to accommodate this fundamental fact?"<br /><br />Question 3: [1:45:55] – “I was raised in a conservative Christian home, but as an adult have rejected the faith of my parents.  I have noticed that these recent years have seen many Christians embrace leftist ideals such as letting in more refugees while battling non-existent racism.  Other Christians have gotten tired and disengaged from politics altogether with a ‘Lord Jesus come soon’ attitude.  White Christian America is under attack, and I am angry to see it, but has Christianity not made the West vulnerable to exploitation but pushing a gospel of grace and forgiveness instead of loyalty to kin and country?  As white people everywhere are asked to give more of their money and more space in their countries to second and third world immigrants and refugees, does Christianity really provide the backbone to protect ourselves from this invasion, or does it ask for too much grace to be extended to outside people groups?”<br /><br />Question 4: [2:33:29] – “I posit that holding on to traumas perpetrated on us is the logical consequence to the inability/unwillingness to forgive ... the need to exact reparations, revenge, perceived justice (which really cannot ever be actually or satisfactorily realized in the case of these terrible abuses) and to somehow ‘right’ the wrong will never leave us as long as we (to milk the analogy) withhold the forgiveness of the debt. It has at least been my experience that until we stop expecting to be "reimbursed" and move on, our own personal happiness (and functionality) is mightily impacted. I think it would be really interesting to work through the philosophy of forgiveness.  What is your stance on forgiveness?”<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

For the past two years I have really noticed a huge shift to leftism, pc, and post modernism inside the “libertarian movement”. These left-libertarians have infected state and national parties. These same people are the ones who will smear anyone who thinks Western Civilization and American Tradition is something to be proud of and protected. Nasty people. Even when empirical evidence is provided, they completely cuck out and proceed with terrible analogies, sophistry, and insults. For example, a lot of times when asked about the European migrant crisis they say, ‘I am not living there, so I am not qualified to give an opinion’. They say that but yet, don’t live in Venezuela and know it’s a basket-case. Is that because they have deep rooted relationships with leftists that prevents them from thinking clearly? I have several examples I would like to discuss but my ultimate question is, what do we do with the libertarians? It seems it’s a 60/40 split of left libertarians vs. Hoppean/Rothbard right libertarians. Is it time to abandon the name libertarian or do we fight? I am leaning towards abandoning, but what are your thoughts?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [2:02:06] - “I'm training and practicing in the male dominated field of general surgery. I have come under increased scrutiny for not being more of an alpha female. Ultimately, this has led to my seeming weak to my superiors. I'm struggling with accepting and moving on from the cycle I have helped create: I act womanly, therefore I'm treated like a weak-link, therefore I somewhat feel that way, leading to being less confident, then treated with less respect, and the cycle continues. This in the context that surgery as a field and including my superiors, aren't very aware of how to handle the subtle differences between men and women surgeons. Additionally, this has be partially responsible for the program asking/telling me to repeat the 3rd of 5th year of training. My question is, how do I personally and professionally overcome this? Also, as a 31-year-old married childless woman, do I balance this with the small part of me that entertains the idea of quitting and growing our family.“&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [3:29:26] - “How do I peacefully prepare my child for a violent world? - Or - Am I adequately preparing my children for the world by being a peaceful parent? Being a peaceful parent has given me children who are bright, brilliant and kind...but terrified of authority and violence. My little boy is crippled by anxiety. He cries every day before school. The other children seem so unaffected. Living in Appalachia, the general consensus is that I am not doing my part to toughen him up. Do I really have to? We have been to doctors, he is in counseling, but I am afraid...what if the problem is me? (I even learned how to shoot a gun so he feels safer when his dad is not here. I never thought I would ever fire a gun.) I was so glad to find out that Stefan is a peaceful parenting advocate. So many of the advocates make it look like hippy dippy nonsense.

As a father I am always willing to use nonphysical consequences, redirection, reasoning, and the like before any physical consequences, but as these periodically fail to correct a maladaptive behavior I have found spanking sufficient to do this. My position is that spanking is actually an appropriate form of disciple (again as a last resort) primarily because it teaches a truth about life, namely, that sometimes there are physically painful consequences to our actions.  These, if done correctively and not punitively, may get our attention and cause us to change our behavior. I’d love to talk about this with Stefan and get his perspective on the issue.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [56:45] - “The left uses mass shooting survivors as ‘extra credible’ figures to argue their point. I think this is unethical. As a shooting survivor myself, I try not to do the same. Should I stick to those guns, or should I use my “victim” status to trump the argument?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:30:30] - “I am the oldest child and only son in my family. My two sisters and I grew up in a single-mother household, and I have seen many of the common negative effects of that environment manifest themselves. I had my "red pill" moment a few years ago and have been obsessively striving towards self-improvement ever since. Given what I now know about the pitfalls of single-motherhood and the importance of positive male role models, I find myself feeling very guilty about not doing much to fill that role for my younger sisters growing up. Of course I began trying to correct that as soon as possible, but I also fear that I have missed the most crucial time period in their lives where I could have made a major impact. Can the older brother effectively fulfill the role left unfilled by the father to any meaningful extent, even if he only becomes aware of the responsibilities of that role after the sisters have entered their teenage years?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:24:00] – “After watching your videos on free will and AI I find myself questioning your belief that it would be impossible for machines to one day emulate human awareness and free will. If we hold Darwinian evolution to be true, it points to humans evolving from organisms that did not have free will. But merely an instinct to adapt survive and reproduce. Question: Considering the fact that we evolved from apes with no free will, do you consider it impossible that software designed to evolve and learn via neural network machine learning and reproductive evolution could eventually obtain a concision awareness of itself and gain free will given enough time?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Life is good - however, I know my biological clock is ticking, and I really want kids, but I don't have a partner. Where are the smart, manly guys interested in a smart, family-minder partner? I used not to worry too much thinking I can always be a single mum if by say 35 I'm still single. It would be tough, but I know I could do it. However, after I started listening to FDR, I feel less comfortable about that option. Of course, I want the best for my potential future baby! I think I would be a great mother, but fatherhood is one thing I can't provide. I would love to hear your thoughts and maybe get some advice.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:12:35] – “In less than 3 decades after the fall of the Soviet Union collectivist ideologies have infiltrated our media, universities, businesses, schools, and government agencies.  Growing groups of young people clamor for openly Socialist politicians like Bernie Sanders and clearly leftist policies like universal health care and gun control.  So, why resist?  Why don't we turn and embrace Communism as a viable way to structure our society if that's what so many people want?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [2:00:14] – “I recently listened to a podcast on anti-natalism. And needless to say it left me churning for the last few days. The pro-anti-natalist made the point that due to the vast amount of suffering in the world verses the sparse amount of pleasure/good that if we were to look at things from the perspective of the as yet to exist child that the said child would obviously choose nonexistence. I can almost understand this proposition but find myself in the end disagreeing with it. Now this brings up a few conundrums for me. Firstly in order to have any opinion/perspective a thing would have to exist in some form, so then wouldn't a person be causing undo suffering by consciously denying that hypothetical child the opportunity to experience whether it is full of pain or not. It seems to me that this is almost a case of the grass is always greener on the other side wherein from a materialist perspective (I'm not exactly a certifiable materialist) there is no such thing as nothingness outside of the human mind. Even in quantum mechanics a seemingly empty space has the potential to spontaneously produce little bits and pieces. So how in the real world would we have any concept on whether nothingness would be better than even the most painful experiences?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:23:20] – “How do you help a world (or someone) that believes it doesn't need your help? How do you save someone heading for the cliffs singing "I believe I can fly!"? I used to believe in the principle of non-involvement and only giving advices when the person/ the world asks for it. What if the price of the mistake about too be made is too great? A personal version of these questions have arisen in my personal life; my brother is planning to get married and I believe it to be a common case of the son repeating the mistake of the father.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I'm listening to one of your call-in-shows right now and Stef is having a rant about Westerners having babies.  I want a person to raise.  I also badly want my wife to be a mother.  Adoption is anywhere between $35,000-50,000.  I'm at a fork in the road right now ('m 40 years old and she is 37). Do we try to go for adoption?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [1:01:08] – “Whenever the idea of marriage or longer-term relationships is discussed among my circles, the saying ‘people change over time’ continually crosses my mind and makes me wonder how people can commit to someone they don't really know. Sure they may know the person today, who they are, what their values are, what they want out of life, goals, ambitions, values, family goals, etc. etc. but acknowledging the idea that people change over time, I'm left kind of puzzled at the prospect of commitment to who that person will be tomorrow, the day after, the year after or ten years down the line. How can you commit to someone 10 years down the line, when not only do you not know who they're going to be by that time, but you don't know who you yourself are going to be?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:24:08] - “In studying the drug epidemic, I've realized that the black market for drugs for exhibits the same market characteristics of any other commodity market. It's my view that if illicit drugs become prohibitively expensive, their use (i.e. demand) will fall precipitously. To make this case we needn't think it terms of hypotheticals, just look at the way the DEA stopped the quaalude crisis. Our country had a real problem with quaaludes when the drug cost 25 cents a hit in the 70's and early 80's. By investigating and shutting down the supply centers, the price of quaaludes rose to over $250/pill and the number of quaalude addicts (and deaths and injuries) fell to almost zero. We should take a similar approach to the drugs that currently plague our society.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:37:15] – “I'm a 20-year-old man. When I was but a few days old I was circumcised, too much skin was removed, and the cuts were too deep. As a result I am bound as a man today who can't have sex with a woman or achieve orgasm (severe neurological damage). I feel embarrassed, ashamed, inadequate, violated and angry beyond comprehension. The 14th amendment’s equal protection under the law clause (yes the one the courts used to legalize gay marriage) says I, or any other male should have been protected from genital cutting since females are LEGALLY protected from it. I'd like to bring awareness to what an absolutely pernicious and repulsive practice it is, and how it's personally made me want to end my life. I'd like to finally talk about it anonymously, to try and leave this horrible anger behind.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

Specifically, how it is that we can best actualize movement towards our life goal in the face of being held back by inner alter ego’s, set about undermining our development in this regard. My pursuit of philosophy has opened up a deep sinkhole of existential angst below me. Gone are the days when I was sure of what would provide my life with meaning, that being theoretical physics. Such work would almost guarantee my dependence upon the state. As such I can’t justify this path any longer, knowing what I know now. Thanks to you I sincerely believe that my life will be best spent in service to philosophy and in championing the stewardship of the individual. Now that I have a new aim, I feel held back by my previous motivations, by the fantasy of becoming a great theoretical physicist. I am stuck deep in the cobweb laden forest of procrastination due to my being so attached to this fantasy. What are your thoughts on how to go about reconciling two disparate and conflicting motivational drives? Have you ever been at a point in your life where your motivations for pursuing a particular life goal, conflicted with a different set of motivations? If so how did you go about reconciling the two motivational frames? How did you let your old self die so as to move on and pursue your new purpose?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [59:57] – “I am currently going through a divorce with my wife of two years. She was a single mom of 2 (both from different fathers) when I met her. We have a child together who is now 1 1/2 years old. The most imminent reason for the divorce is that I found out 2 months ago that she was a week into carrying another man's child. As you can probably imagine, my biggest concern now is how this is going to affect our son. I want to be able to raise him as best I can despite the fact that his mother and I will be separated. I don't have any support from immediate family and I doubt I will which is why I haven't even explained to them what's going on. I am willing to do whatever it takes and am curious to hear your input on what that might be?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:41:38] – “When I was growing up, people didn't seem to question how the rich got rich. It was always taken that if you were wealthy, it would be because you were smart, worked hard and probably got a bit lucky. There was never any contempt or anger toward someone for being successful in life, certainly not on the scale that I've witnessed amongst my friends and in the media lately. What I've noticed is a gradual gravitation towards a loathing and seething resentment against the wealthy. "They probably got rich because of inherent privilege!" "They are wealthy because they inherited it!" "We should tax them more in order to fund the poor!" In fact, this bubbling anger seems to have surfaced as a neo-Marxist argument which is creeping ever further into our culture and politics globally. How do we solve this argument of entitlement of the wealthy? Do the rich really deserve their wealth in all cases? How can we argue against the "rob the rich, to feed the poor is justified" mantra I've been hearing more and more from the Government and my social circles?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:39:59] – “How do I get over the fear of success? Growing up, my parents encouraged participation-based sports and shunned any competition.  For education, whenever I succeeded with my grades, my parents would downplay my success and make fun of me for being smart.   As soon as I was doing something where I excelled, my parents would take it away, or my sisters would mock me, become violent, and try to make me feel ashamed of myself for succeeding at things like sports or sewing. As an adult, my parents refuse to take an interest in my success, even downplaying my sewing projects, my cooking ability and my peaceful parenting. I've attempted to start several small businesses because of how talented people say I am, but I stop working on the businesses once I start seeing success.

If you agree then how is this accomplished?  If not, then why can they not be compatible? In my opinion, humans are ordinary animals and have no special type of consciousness. If you agree then why do you say that other animals do not debate and simply process data while humans have something unique that is beyond data processing while debating?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [39:21] – “I'm a 35-year-old American male living abroad in a Latin American country. I'm very grateful to my host nation for the opportunities it's afforded me. I speak the language and make a concerted effort to conform when out in public. However, I see that many of the locals here have worked illegally in the United States. In fact, many small businesses here earned the capital to start via illegal immigration. They were willing to work long hours at significantly lower wages in the US and disregard the consequences of bad credit, hospital bills, and other financial obstacles most American citizens cannot, because they could simply pack up and leave. They had a home nation to fall back on where US wages spent better and allowed them to advance further economically in ways Americans could not. “ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“After having lived down here for several years, I no longer agree with America's de facto open-border policy. It seems lopsided in favor of developing economies and their citizens. I see now how their financial gain is at the direct expense of low-skilled American workers, and to make matters worse, because the American economy is in decay, many older Americans wishing to retire are being forced to leave and to take their savings, social security and other financial assets abroad. In fact, some countries down here openly encourage Americans to retire here. So first their citizens came to the US to earn wages and send home remittances, and now they are receiving the added benefit of the disposable income of American retirees. This may be great for them, but it's terrible for American interests. As a foreign national living abroad, does my current disagreement with relaxed immigration policies make me a hypocrite?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [1:11:52] – “Stefan has mentions subjects as ‘red flags’ and also that childhood trauma can develop certain patterns in behavior or even deficiency in the brain which leads to certain behavior. He also has mentioned facts about promiscuity and how that decreases the chances of a successful marriage with a person who has had more partners in life. The reason I want to have this call is because recently my boyfriend broke up with me after 2.5 years and his arguments were: ‘You have too many red flags, Stefan Molyneux says this and that about this and that… so you are too much of a risk for me and I don’t want to continue and take this risk.’ If someone has the ‘red flags’ (childhood trauma, promiscuity, drugs, emotionally unstable) is it always going to be a risk? Is it possible to truly heal and be virtues or will it always be a risk at all time because you cannot change the past? Can a person with red flags ever get rid of the risks it creates by doing self-work or will it always be a risk despite? I really want to make better decisions in life about relationships. Stefan always says, why is everybody calling me afterwards? Well I try to call him beforehand and use his advice to make better decisions.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [2:51:46] – "Should I as a father and husband be more concerned with the philosophy espoused in a community or engage with a community despite my reservations for the social wellbeing of my family? What is more important being free of philosophical fallacies even if that means not being a part of a local community or finding a community that I can halfway stomach to increase the social circle and support for my family despite the illogical or disingenuous teachings?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

They were willing to work long hours at significantly lower wages in the US and disregard the consequences of bad credit, hospital bills, and other financial obstacles most American citizens cannot, because they could simply pack up and leave. They had a home nation to fall back on where US wages spent better and allowed them to advance further economically in ways Americans could not. “ <br /><br />“After having lived down here for several years, I no longer agree with America's de facto open-border policy. It seems lopsided in favor of developing economies and their citizens. I see now how their financial gain is at the direct expense of low-skilled American workers, and to make matters worse, because the American economy is in decay, many older Americans wishing to retire are being forced to leave and to take their savings, social security and other financial assets abroad. In fact, some countries down here openly encourage Americans to retire here. So first their citizens came to the US to earn wages and send home remittances, and now they are receiving the added benefit of the disposable income of American retirees. This may be great for them, but it's terrible for American interests. As a foreign national living abroad, does my current disagreement with relaxed immigration policies make me a hypocrite?”<br /><br />Question 3: [1:11:52] – “Stefan has mentions subjects as ‘red flags’ and also that childhood trauma can develop certain patterns in behavior or even deficiency in the brain which leads to certain behavior. He also has mentioned facts about promiscuity and how that decreases the chances of a successful marriage with a person who has had more partners in life. The reason I want to have this call is because recently my boyfriend broke up with me after 2.5 years and his arguments were: ‘You have too many red flags, Stefan Molyneux says this and that about this and that… so you are too much of a risk for me and I don’t want to continue and take this risk.’ If someone has the ‘red flags’ (childhood trauma, promiscuity, drugs, emotionally unstable) is it always going to be a risk? Is it possible to truly heal and be virtues or will it always be a risk at all time because you cannot change the past? Can a person with red flags ever get rid of the risks it creates by doing self-work or will it always be a risk despite? I really want to make better decisions in life about relationships. Stefan always says, why is everybody calling me afterwards? Well I try to call him beforehand and use his advice to make better decisions.”<br /><br />Question 4: [2:51:46] – "Should I as a father and husband be more concerned with the philosophy espoused in a community or engage with a community despite my reservations for the social wellbeing of my family? What is more important being free of philosophical fallacies even if that means not being a part of a local community or finding a community that I can halfway stomach to increase the social circle and support for my family despite the illogical or disingenuous teachings?"<br /><br />Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.

I was diagnosed with ADHD and took medication to mitigate the condition. I still got good grades but remember it being a chore and do not have any positive feelings about it. I only had one teacher that encouraged thinking, new ideas, and creativity. Then I went to college where it was pretty obvious what type of thinking they wanted. I went along with it because I wanted the grade. As a father, I think about what effect public schools will have on my children. Was my willingness to go along instead of thinking for myself a result of the schooling I had? Or was it just my personality and laziness?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 2: [40:33] – “In a recent debate, you had mentioned that the level of consciousness that animals possess is essentially worthless in the level of debate that take part in with one another. Would this viewpoint change in cases where an animal's ability to detect and draw relevant conclusions from certain types of information far surpass that of humans?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 3: [56:48] – “Reason and logic combined with science, technology and the western ideals of freedom appear to inevitably lead to ‘modern’ social changes that threaten to destroy civilizations.  The mechanism of destruction is vast wealth, power and success which allows us to absorb foolish social decisions until our beloved Western societies are destroyed after an inevitable ‘point of no return.’  Can we balance the positives of reason and logic against the negative social impact of techno-freedom or are the products of modern ‘rationality’ far too dangerous for to be left uncontained? Can Western civilization survive its own success?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Question 4: [1:35:25] – “I hear you talk about the importance of committed marriage and how important it is for the healthy development of children, and I have also deeply valued this, remaining in a very difficult marriage in hopes of providing the best possible outcome for the children.  However, I have also heard you speak to irreparable damage that can be done in a relationship and wonder if my marriage has reached that point.  My husband has an ACE score of 8 and mine is a 1.  In our marriage there have been many challenging issues, most of which I think relate to deeply entrenched unhealthy relational habits that began in childhood for him, as a result of the abuses and traumas he experienced.  I also believe this unhealed trauma in his life has been at the root of a pornography addiction that started at a young age for him and, despite counseling and recovery programs, continues still.  Is it possible that it could actually be better (or neutral) for the children for us to separate or divorce if I am finding that I cannot see a way forward for him to repair the damage he has caused in our marriage for over two decades?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your support is essential to Freedomain Radio, which is 100% funded by viewers like you.
