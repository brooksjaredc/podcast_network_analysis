      <title>Ep. 45 - Ilona Ciunaite </title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this episode of The Indie Spiritualist, Chris chats with Ilona Ciunaite about fear, truth, and helping each other along the spiritual path. 

Ilona’s search for truth started in 2002, when for the first time she “experienced the silence of the thinking mind, a sweet sense of being, contentment, peace,” and “feeling at home.” In 2010 she discovered Jed McKenna’s books, which were a shock to her belief system and catapulted her “out of hypnosis” and toward the realization that all she believed was not truth. It wasn’t until the initial deconstruction was done, after months of painful self-inquiry, that Ciunaite felt at peace: there was an emptiness, a not knowing, a not believing anything about anything. Then the last step was taken and the separate self was seen to be an illusion.

Together Ciunaite and Nezhinsky published a book, Gateless Gatecrashers, that consists of conversations leading to self-realization, and which can be downloaded for free at Liberation Unleashed. Liberation Unleashed is a global movement of people helping others to see through the illusion of self. Ciunaite has had hundreds of conversations with people from all around the globe. Her main focus and work is helping people end their seeking by inviting them to question their fundamental assumptions and look at their own experience. She does not give answers, only questions. In this way a seeker may see what is going on for themselves and free their minds from conditioned patterns to explore whatever comes next. Ciunaite holds live meetings and group sessions in the UK. All of her work can be found on her blog Marked, Eternal and on The Gate forum.]]>

      <title>Ep. 38 - Gabor Mate</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week on the Indie Spiritualist, Chris has an insightful conversation with the spiritual teacher and author, Gabor Maté, about trauma, addiction, and recovery. What do we get out of our addictions? How does trauma cause us to disconnect from ourselves and dismiss our own experience? Gabor raises these important questions and provides guidance to rise above our suffering and self-abuse so that we may better care for ourselves and our loved ones.   Show Notes Addictions Are Not The Problem – Gabor and I discuss how addictions are not the problem but instead are the person’s attempt to solve a problem in their life.   Growing Up – Gabor and I explore the emotional and psychological conditions of children and their environment while growing up as a key component of the root cause of addiction.   Trauma, Addiction, and the Brain – Gabor talks about the relationship between trauma, our brain, and addiction.   Making Change – Gabor breaks down how we can begin to understand and then work with the traumas in our lives for true healing.   Falling — Gabor talks about why many people who have tools, been in recovery, or on a spiritual path and work with mantras, meditation, prayer, yoga, and so forth, still fall into old self-defeating behaviors at times.   Rising – Gabor and I explore the shame, stress, self-loathing and other negative feelings that come along for those who fall back into self-defeating behaviors and what people can do to not get lost in those overwhelming negative feelings?   Watching Addiction – Gabor talks about what family members can do for a loved one who is caught in the grips of addiction.   God and Recovery — Gabor talks about what a power greater than ourselves really means and how we can begin to transcend our limited egoic selves. More About Gabor Maté Gabor Maté is a sought-after speaker and teacher, regularly addressing health professionals, educators, and lay audiences throughout North America. As an author, Dr. Maté has written several bestselling books including the award-winning In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction; When the Body Says No: The Cost of Hidden Stress; and Scattered Minds: A New Look at the Origins and Healing of Attention Deficit Disorder, and co-authored Hold on to Your Kids. His works have been published internationally in twenty languages. Dr. Maté is the co-founder of Compassion for Addiction, a new non-profit that focuses on addiction. He is also an advisor of Drugs over Dinner. Dr. Maté has received the Hubert Evans Prize for Literary Non-Fiction; an Honorary Degree (Law) from the University of Northern British Columbia; an Outstanding Alumnus Award from Simon Fraser University; and the 2012 Martin Luther King Humanitarian Award from Mothers Against Teen Violence.]]>

      <title>Ep. 37 - J. Ivy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On this episode of The Indie Spiritualist, Chris has on poet and author, J. Ivy. As a performance poet & author, Ivy’s passionate delivery always leaves spectators transfixed in a state of inspiration. His motto, “Dreams Don’t Come True, They Are True” has guided him from his hometown Chicago to hundreds of cities. J. Ivy’s new goal to get one million people to write a letter to their fathers is themed as “One Million Letters Written, One Million Hearts Healed!” This campaign’s mission is to help inspire healing through writing for children and adults who have grown up in fatherless homes, which will in turn help to prevent this hurt and imbalance from being perpetuated. Listen to Chris and J go deep about family, forgiveness, and inspiring the next generation.   Show Notes Chicago – J reminisces about his childhood years when he was still known as James Richardson and what it was like growing up in Chicago during the late seventies and early eighties. Changes – J talks about his experience of being a young teenager and watching his father’s life spiral out of control as he became an alcoholic, lost his job, his parents divorcing, and how that affected him.  Words – J shares candidly about a deep depression he experienced later on in his life, which led him to stop going to class and work, and how the art of writing helped him to find his way out of that. The Art Of Words – J & I explore various pieces of advice for aspiring writers. Thank You – J talks about the importance of gratitude in his life and how it can help to stop the negative self-talk our mind sometimes throws at us. Forgiveness – J talks about forgiveness as a teacher, and how to authentically forgive oneself and others. Dear Father – J talks about The Dear Father Letter Writing Campaign he started with his wife, whose mission is to help inspire healing through writing for children and adults who have grown up in fatherless homes, which will in turn help to prevent this hurt and imbalance from being passed on to the next generations. More About J. Ivy J. Ivy, a NAACP Image Award Winning Poet has been featured on Grammy Award Winning Platinum Albums with Kanye West, Jay-Z & John Legend.  He is the author of two books, Here I AM: Then & Now & Dear Father Breaking The Cycle of Pain published by Beyond Words/Atria/Simon & Schuster.  Find J on twitter @J_Ivy or at www.J-Ivy.com. ]]>

      <title>Ep. 34 - Interspirituality with Kurt Johnson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Interspirituality with Kurt Johnson Episode Recap Show Notes: • Early Years – Kurt discusses some of his early life events—including depression, scientific studies and much more—and how they led him to his life’s passion. • Wayne Teasdale – Kurt shares about his deep friendship with the wonderful Brother Wayne Teasdale, the impact he had on his life, and the continuing impact his work has in the world. • Interspirituality – In The Coming Interspiritual Age, Kurt writes, “Interspirituality is the natural discussion among human beings about what we are experiencing. In academic terms, it’s the intersubjective discussion among us all about who we are, why we are here, and where we are going. In the context of religion, interspirituality is the common heritage of humankind’s spiritual wisdom and the sharing of wisdom resources across traditions. In terms of our developing human consciousness, interspirituality is the movement of all these discussions toward the experience of profound interconnectedness, unity consciousness, and oneness.” Kurt and I explore what it means to be interspiritual and how it can deepen our spiritual paths. • Everyone’s A Mystic – Kurt and I explore our mutual friend Ken Wilber’s four quadrants of “I”, “We”, “It” and “It’s” and how they relate to each of us being a mystic. • Scientific Consciousness Studies – Kurt talks about scientific consciousness studies, discussing our basic experience of consciousness and “raw feeling”, quantum ideas of consciousness, and the future of unconsciousness.   Kurt's Website Kurt's Bio Kurt Johnson, Ph.D.  has worked in professional science and comparative religion for over 40 years and serves on many international committees, particularly at the United Nations.  In comparative culture and religion Kurt has been on the faculty of New York City’s One Spirit Interfaith Seminary for 12 years and is the co-author of the very influential 2013 book on the future of world religions: The Coming Interspiritual Age. In science, with a PhD in Evolution, Ecology and Comparative Biology he was on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History for 25 years and is currently associated with the McGuire Center for Biodiversity at the University of Florida.  Kurt has published over 200 scientific articles and seven books, including the popular science bestseller Nabokov’s Blues: The Scientific Odyssey of a Literary Genius. In 2015 his book on science and the arts, Fine Lines, appears from Yale University Press along with contributions in a United Nations NGO publication:  Ethics, Spiritual Values, and the New United Nations Development Agenda. Kurt has presented regularly on science and religion at The Science and Nonduality Conference and the Parliament of the World’s Religions and published articles on this inter-relationship in many periodicals, including audio discussions with Ken Wilber at Integral Life. He is a founding member of the Contemplative Alliance and President of the Friends of the Institute of Noetic Sciences. At the United Nations he serves on the Executive Committee of the UN NGO Committee on Spirituality, Values and Global Concerns and the NGO Forum 21 Institute.  Formerly a monastic for over 10 years, and active in contemplative and sacred activism across several traditions, Kurt is also an ordained Eco-Minister and recently co-edited the Namaste Insights internet magazine on the eco-vision of interfaith pioneers Thomas Berry and Wayne Teasdale.

I remember even Wayne Dyer humorously sharing about how he couldn’t even keep track of how many times he’s gone back and forth about it, one minute suggesting we befriend it, only to later say we need to destroy it, and back and forth etc. So what is ego from your perspective and what the hell do we do with it?   Recommendations:   Chandresh's Website   Break The Norms Website   Chandresh’s Book:  Break The Norms   Other Books:  10% Happier by Dan Harris,  Real Happiness by Sharon Salzberg]]>

      <title>Ep. 32 - Jack Canfield</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jack Canfield Episode Recap   Bio   You probably know Jack Canfield as the co-creator and co-author of the New York Times #1 best-selling Chicken Soup for the Soul book series which currently has 225 titles in the series and more than 500 million copies in print in 47 languages.   He is also the founder and President of the Canfield Training Institute, which trains entrepreneurs, corporate leaders, managers and sales professionals in how to accelerate the achievement of their personal, professional and financial goals.   Jack has personally helped hundreds of thousands of people on six different continents become multi-millionaires, business leaders, best-selling authors, leading sales professionals, successful entrepreneurs, and world-class athletes while at the same time creating balanced, fulfilling and healthy lives.   Jack is a dynamic speaker and was recently inducted into the National Speakers Association’s Speakers Hall of Fame.   He has appeared on more than 1000 radio and television shows including Oprah, Montel, Larry King Live, the Today Show, and two hour-long PBS Specials devoted exclusively to his work.  Jack is also one of the teachers featured in the recent hit movies The Secret, The Truth and The Tapping Solution.      Jack’s best-known success resources are the New York Times best-selling book “The 10th Anniversary of the Success Principles: How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be, The Power of Focus, The Aladdin Factor, and Jack Canfield’s Key to Living the Law of Attraction.  All of these resources consist of powerful strategies designed to empower and inspire individuals to achieving success.  Jack’s vision is to train 1 million people his “success principles” to pass on his legacy to others.  He now has resources, live trainings and online certification course work available.    Jack has been presenting these powerful principles and breakthrough strategies for 40 years to corporations, governments and universities in more than 30 countries. His clients have included Virgin Records, SONY Pictures, Daimler-Chrysler, KFC, Federal Express, GE, Johnson & Johnson, Merrill Lynch, Campbell’s Soup, Re/Max, The Million Dollar Forum, The Million Dollar Roundtable, and The Young Presidents Organization.      Episode Outline:   • A Family Disease – Jack and I begin our conversation by discussing how even though he personally hasn’t struggled with substance abuse or addiction, he has had some very tough times as a child living with an angry alcoholic father, a mother who crossed the line from abuse to dependence, and an aunt and grandmother as well as two of his own children struggling with substance abuse.   • The Golden Buddha – Jack shares a story about a Golden Buddha and how it relates to those setting out on a path of sobriety.   • Can I Ever Drink Again – Jack addresses the two most common questions that come up in regards to the 30-Day Sobriety Solution, which are 1) Can I ever drink again and 2) Do I need to quit drinking right now?   • The Importance of 30 Days – Jack and I discuss an interesting experiment conducted by NASA that demonstrates why it takes 25-30 days to successfully reprogram the brain.   • Event + Response = Outcome – Jack breaks down an equation he uses in his book which states that E + R = O, or, Event + Response = Outcome. From The 30 Day Sobriety Solution: “Every outcome you experience in life—sobriety or alcoholism, excessive drinking or “normal” drinking, financial success or poverty, health or sickness, happiness or dissatisfaction—is the result of how you have responded to an earlier event or events in your life. The formula states that if you don’t like the outcomes you are experiencing in your life today, you have two options: 1) You can blame the event (E) for your lack of results (O) or 2) You can change your responses (R) to the events (E) —the way things are—until you get the outcomes (O) you want.”   • Why Do You Drink? – There’s a brief but very important section of The 30 Day Sobriety Solution that explores why people drink, noting that alcohol (or any other substance) is merely the symptom, whereas the real problem lies elsewhere, which Jack and I explore.   • The Importance of Action – Jack elaborates on an interesting statistic he shared in his book regarding the percentage of information we retain after 2 weeks time and how it depends on the various ways in which we take it in.   • The Power of Vision – Jack and I conclude our conversation by addressing one of the themes of the major themes of the book, which is how to get from where you are to where you want to be, or knowing where you are today vs. where you want to be in the future, and the importance of creating a vision and detailed description around that.   Recommendations:   Jack's Website   Jack’s Books:  The 30-Day Sobriety Solution,  The Success Principles,  The Power of Focus   Other Books:  In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts by Gabor Mate,  Recovering Joy by Kevin Griffin,  No Mud, No Louts by Thich Nhat Hanh]]>

      <title>Ep. 30 - Noah Levine</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Bio Noah Levine, author of Dharma Punx, Against The Stream, The Heart of the Revolution and Refuge Recovery, is a Buddhist teacher, author and counselor. He has created a Buddhist approach to addiction recovery called Refuge Recovery, that includes peer lead meetings as well as a professional treatment center. He is also the founding teacher of Against the Stream Buddhist Meditation Society, with centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Nashville and over 20 affiliated groups around North America. He teaches meditation classes, workshops and retreats internationally. Noah holds a Masters degree in counseling psychology and lives in Los Angeles.   Episode Outline:   • Dharma Punk – Noah talks about his experience with addiction and how it led him to the Buddhist Path.   • A Community Effort – Noah revisits the origins of Refuge Recovery and shares about all of the preparation that went into the endeavor.   • Refuge Recovery –In the Refuge Recovery book, Noah writes, “Refuge Recovery is a practice, a process, a set of tools, a treatment, and a path to healing addiction and the suffering caused by addiction.” Which we discuss.   • Addiction Creates Suffering – Noah and I explore The Four Truths of recovery, beginning with the First Truth, which is, addiction creates suffering. In Refuge Recovery, Noah writes, “This is not a philosophy. It is a practice; it demands action. We must understand, acknowledge, admit, and take this action by writing and sharing an in-depth and detailed inventory of the suffering we have experienced in association with our addictions.” Can you expand on that?   • The Cause of Addiction Is Repetitive Craving – The Second Truth of recovery is that the cause of addiction is repetitive craving. In Refuge Recovery Noah writes, “We have come to understand that all forms of addiction have their roots in the natural human tendency to crave for life to be more pleasurable and less painful than it actually is. The addict is not at fault for the root causes and conditions that lead to addiction, only for the habitual reactive patterns that perpetuate it.” Which again, we discuss.   • Recovery Is Possible – The Third Truth of recovery is that recovery is possible. In Refuge Recovery Noah writes write, “Freedom from the suffering caused by addiction is attainable, if we are ready and willing to take responsibility for our actions and to follow the Eightfold Path. As you enter this process and attend group meetings, you will connect with many others who have also suffered the consequences of addiction and are now recovering. Allow the group to inspire you and to show the possibilities of recovery, while also making room for the imperfections of some of the individuals within the group.”   • The Path To Recovery – So The Four Noble Truths sets out the way, the Eightfold Path, that leads to the end of suffering and is composed of eight factors, which Noah talks about.   • Buddhist Atheist – Noah and I discuss an interesting conversation we recently had about God in relation to recovery and relapse.   • Moving Forward – Noah talks about the current and future state of Refuge Recovery.   Recommendations:   Refuge Recovery Website   Against The Stream Website   Noah’s Book:  Refuge Recovery,  Dharma Punx,  Against The Stream,  The Heart of the Revolution   Other Books:  Indie Spiritualist by Chris Grosso (Foreword by Noah Levine),  Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner]]>

In Refuge Recovery Noah writes write, “Freedom from the suffering caused by addiction is attainable, if we are ready and willing to take responsibility for our actions and to follow the Eightfold Path. As you enter this process and attend group meetings, you will connect with many others who have also suffered the consequences of addiction and are now recovering. Allow the group to inspire you and to show the possibilities of recovery, while also making room for the imperfections of some of the individuals within the group.”   • The Path To Recovery – So The Four Noble Truths sets out the way, the Eightfold Path, that leads to the end of suffering and is composed of eight factors, which Noah talks about.   • Buddhist Atheist – Noah and I discuss an interesting conversation we recently had about God in relation to recovery and relapse.   • Moving Forward – Noah talks about the current and future state of Refuge Recovery.   Recommendations:   Refuge Recovery Website   Against The Stream Website   Noah’s Book:  Refuge Recovery,  Dharma Punx,  Against The Stream,  The Heart of the Revolution   Other Books:  Indie Spiritualist by Chris Grosso (Foreword by Noah Levine),  Hardcore Zen by Brad Warner</itunes:summary>

        <![CDATA[Bio Noah Levine, author of Dharma Punx, Against The Stream, The Heart of the Revolution and Refuge Recovery, is a Buddhist teacher, author and counselor. He has created a Buddhist approach to addiction recovery called Refuge Recovery, that includes peer lead meetings as well as a professional treatment center. He is also the founding teacher of Against the Stream Buddhist Meditation Society, with centers in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Nashville and over 20 affiliated groups around North America. He teaches meditation classes, workshops and retreats internationally. Noah holds a Masters degree in counseling psychology and lives in Los Angeles.   Episode Outline:   • Dharma Punk – Noah talks about his experience with addiction and how it led him to the Buddhist Path.   • A Community Effort – Noah revisits the origins of Refuge Recovery and shares about all of the preparation that went into the endeavor.   • Refuge Recovery –In the Refuge Recovery book, Noah writes, “Refuge Recovery is a practice, a process, a set of tools, a treatment, and a path to healing addiction and the suffering caused by addiction.” Which we discuss.   • Addiction Creates Suffering – Noah and I explore The Four Truths of recovery, beginning with the First Truth, which is, addiction creates suffering. In Refuge Recovery, Noah writes, “This is not a philosophy. It is a practice; it demands action. We must understand, acknowledge, admit, and take this action by writing and sharing an in-depth and detailed inventory of the suffering we have experienced in association with our addictions.” Can you expand on that?   • The Cause of Addiction Is Repetitive Craving – The Second Truth of recovery is that the cause of addiction is repetitive craving. In Refuge Recovery Noah writes, “We have come to understand that all forms of addiction have their roots in the natural human tendency to crave for life to be more pleasurable and less painful than it actually is. The addict is not at fault for the root causes and conditions that lead to addiction, only for the habitual reactive patterns that perpetuate it.” Which again, we discuss.   • Recovery Is Possible – The Third Truth of recovery is that recovery is possible.

      <title>Ep. 29 - Zach Leary</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[  Bio Zach is the host of the “It’s All Happening” podcast, an infrequent blogger/writer and a seasoned digital marketer and brand strategist. Zach is also a practitioner of bhakti yoga as taught through many of the Vedantic systems of Northern India. Through the practice of bhakti yoga he has found keys that unlock doorways that allow the soul to experience it’s true nature of being eternal, full of knowledge and full of bliss. In addition to bhakti yoga, Zach has been influenced by many different methods and traditions of consciousness exploration ranging from trans-humanism to Buddhism and clinical psychology. Zach is also a frequent pundit on the political systems that are fueling societies economic systems and structures. At the core of all of Zach’s work is the belief that we have been fused together by the adoption and collective practice of using technology, spirituality and mysticism to define the very nature of who we are.   Episode Outline:   • Beginnings – Zach talks about growing up with Timothy Leary as a father, having Ram Dass around his house, Be Here Now, and the beginning stages of his spiritual path.   • Controversy – Zach and I discuss ISKON, Osho, Trungpa Rinpoche, and others in regards to their teachings and surrounding life controversies.   • Ram Dass and Maharajji – Zach and I swap stories about our experiences with Ram Dass and Maharajji.   • Kirtan – Zach talks about taking up the harmonium and singing his devotional heart out.   • Music And Spirituality Zach and I talk about finding spirituality in music using examples such as Krishna Das, Bruce Springsteen, Iron Maiden, Shelter, 108 and more.   • The Future Of America – Trump, Clinton, and Sanders. Zach shares his thoughts on why Bernie Or Bust will actually cause more harm than good, and the overall victory that Bernie Sanders has had regardless of how behind he is in the polls.     Recommendations:   Zach's Website   It's All Happening Podcast]]>

      <title>Ep. 26 - Eben Sterling</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Eben grew up in Ojai, California a mile from the home of rebel spiritualist Jiddu Krishnamurti. Eben great aunt was Paramahansa Yogananda's personal assistant and driver for a year at the Mount Washington Ashram in 1949. His father, when he was 6 years-old, also met Yogananda, so the thread of spirituality was woven into Eben’s life experience long before he became aware of its richness and beauty. During his teen years, in the 80's, Eben was a pioneer of the hardcore skateboarding and American hardcore punk rock scenes. He skated, played in bands, went to shows, and today acknowledges his place as a part of that greater movement. The same spirit guided him as he entered his life in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction, and ultimately, into his life as a spiritualist.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mona Haydar is a poet, activist practitioner of Permaculture, meditator, composting devotee, mountain girl, solar power lover and a tireless God-enthusiast. She practices a life of sacred activism, poetry, contemplation and advocacy for living gently upon the Earth. She teaches classes and retreats on mindfulness and Islamic spirituality, leads workshops on creative writing and performs her poetry. Her words have found homes in the hearts of seekers, wanderers, poets, artists, lovers and stewards of the Earth. She grew up in Flint, Michigan, graduated from the University of Michigan and has since lived in Damascus where she studied Arabic and Islamic spirituality then went on to live in the mountains of Northern New Mexico at Lama Foundation and in the Redwood forest of Northern California with her husband and son. Mona and her husband, Sebastian set up a stand in Cambridge, Massachusetts with signs that read 'Talk to a Muslim' 'free coffee and donuts' 'free conversation' and 'Ask a Muslim' encouraging open and loving dialogue which garnered the attention of NPR, Al Jazeera, The Boston Globe among other media outlets. Currently she is working on her second collection of poems and her first work of nonfiction on Islamic Spirituality through the lens of other spiritual traditions. She is working towards her Masters in Divinity. Mona helps to grow a more universal love with her activism, writing, performing and teaching. www.monahaydar.com  
 
Episode Outline:
 

Experiences and Expression – Mona and I discuss her relationship to spirituality and religion as a child, experiencing God in nature and the depth, stillness and interconnectedness that flourished as a result, poetry as an expression of God, pulling ourselves back from the world of form and the God of “busy-ness” and more.

 

 Islam – Mona elaborates on my very nursery school understanding of what the word Islam means, discussing the peace and surrender aspects of it and how the universe has no problem intervening in our lives in order to make us surrender.

 

 The “G” Word – Mona and I discuss who “the one God” is according to the Muslim faith?

 

 Peace Be Upon Him – Mona explains the role of the prophet Muhammad in the Muslim faith.

 

Donuts Anyone? – Mona shares about the “Ask a Muslim” stand she and her husband Sebastian set up in Cambridge, MA, which offers free donuts and coffee to people, as well as a conversation about being Muslim.

 

A Tiny Bit More – Mona shares about the power of reaching out to ones neighbor, regardless of their religion or lack thereof and sharing more love in the world.]]>

Episode Outline:
 

Experiences and Expression – Mona and I discuss her relationship to spirituality and religion as a child, experiencing God in nature and the depth, stillness and interconnectedness that flourished as a result, poetry as an expression of God, pulling ourselves back from the world of form and the God of “busy-ness” and more.

 

 Islam – Mona elaborates on my very nursery school understanding of what the word Islam means, discussing the peace and surrender aspects of it and how the universe has no problem intervening in our lives in order to make us surrender.

 

 The “G” Word – Mona and I discuss who “the one God” is according to the Muslim faith?

 

 Peace Be Upon Him – Mona explains the role of the prophet Muhammad in the Muslim faith.

 

Donuts Anyone? – Mona shares about the “Ask a Muslim” stand she and her husband Sebastian set up in Cambridge, MA, which offers free donuts and coffee to people, as well as a conversation about being Muslim.

 

A Tiny Bit More – Mona shares about the power of reaching out to ones neighbor, regardless of their religion or lack thereof and sharing more love in the world.]]>

      <title>Ep. 19 - Guy Newland</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Guy Newland holds a Ph.D. in the History of Religions from the University of Virginia. He has worked with a great many Tibetan scholars and taught at five Dharma centers--all within the Dalai Lama’s school of Tibetan Buddhism. Since 1988 he has been a professor at Central Michigan University. His publications include The Two Truths (Snow Lion), Appearance and Reality (Snow Lion), Introduction to Emptiness (Snow Lion) and, in collaboration with others, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist Philosophy (Oxford).
 
Episode Outline:
• Early Years – Guy briefly discusses his early years on the spiritual path, studying mystic Christianity, Hinduism, Sufism, his interest in experience rather than doctrine, cultivating compassion within ourselves and finding his home in the Buddhist lineage.
• Traditions – Guy discusses some of the similarities and differences between Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.
• Perception – Guy breaks down the teaching of the two truths—conventional truth and ultimate truth—using various examples that include MacBook’s, Apple Corporation and Steve Jobs, mountains, animals, office buildings, telephones and more.
• The Ground of All Being – Quantum Physics, the human mind, the Tao and seeing reality as it actually is are all discussed.
• Emptiness and Universal Happiness – In life we suffer unnecessarily because we don’t see things the way are, looking to external things for lasting peace and happiness, however, things don’t have a graspable nature. Guy discusses the importance and benefit of understanding the Buddhist teaching of Emptiness and how it’s a peace in accordance with seeing things the way they are. We also cover practicing as a way of service for others as well as ourselves.
• Books! – Guy talks about some of his favorite authors and books including Zen Master Raven, Practice of the Wild and more.
• Music! Guy and I discuss our love of music including Hendrix, Radiohead, The Pixies, Sonic Youth and more.]]>

He has worked with a great many Tibetan scholars and taught at five Dharma centers--all within the Dalai Lama’s school of Tibetan Buddhism. Since 1988 he has been a professor at Central Michigan University. His publications include The Two Truths (Snow Lion), Appearance and Reality (Snow Lion), Introduction to Emptiness (Snow Lion) and, in collaboration with others, Moonshadows: Conventional Truth in Buddhist Philosophy (Oxford).
 
Episode Outline:
• Early Years – Guy briefly discusses his early years on the spiritual path, studying mystic Christianity, Hinduism, Sufism, his interest in experience rather than doctrine, cultivating compassion within ourselves and finding his home in the Buddhist lineage.
• Traditions – Guy discusses some of the similarities and differences between Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.
• Perception – Guy breaks down the teaching of the two truths—conventional truth and ultimate truth—using various examples that include MacBook’s, Apple Corporation and Steve Jobs, mountains, animals, office buildings, telephones and more.
• The Ground of All Being – Quantum Physics, the human mind, the Tao and seeing reality as it actually is are all discussed.
• Emptiness and Universal Happiness – In life we suffer unnecessarily because we don’t see things the way are, looking to external things for lasting peace and happiness, however, things don’t have a graspable nature. Guy discusses the importance and benefit of understanding the Buddhist teaching of Emptiness and how it’s a peace in accordance with seeing things the way they are. We also cover practicing as a way of service for others as well as ourselves.
• Books! – Guy talks about some of his favorite authors and books including Zen Master Raven, Practice of the Wild and more.
• Music! Guy and I discuss our love of music including Hendrix, Radiohead, The Pixies, Sonic Youth and more.]]>

      <title>Ep. 18 - Diane Hamilton</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Bio
Diane Hamilton has been a practitioner of meditation for almost 30 years. She began her studies at Naropa University in 1983 with Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, and became a Zen student of Genpo Roshi’s in 1997. In 2003, she received ordination as a Zen monk with her husband Michael Zimmerman, and received dharma transmission from Roshi in 2006. Diane facilitates Big Mind Big Heart, a process developed by Genpo Roshi to help elicit the insights of Zen in Western audiences. She has worked with Ken Wilber and the Integral Institute since 2004.
 
Episode Outline:

Tragedy/Spirituality – Diane discusses her early years on the spiritual path, losing seven of her friends to a series of accidents at the age of seventeen, which became a very significant catalyst in her spiritual life, studying with Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and more.

 

 Conflict Is Good News – In her book, Everything Is Workable, Diane writes, “To learn to transform conflict, we must let go of the notion that something or someone is wrong or bad,” which she elaborates on.

 

Scary, Yet Exciting – Diane talks about relating to fear directly rather than trying to get rid of it. She explores what becoming aware of it looks like, tastes like, and feels like in our mind and body, and developing fearlessness in the process.

 

Three Perspectives, Three Truths – It has been said that there are three sides to every story; yours, mine, and the truth. Diane discusses individual participation with the three perspectives that are constantly happening, which includes the first person “I,” second person “you,” and third person “it.”

 

Everything and Nothing – Diane discusses what in Zen is often referred to as Big Mind. Others have given it different names including Eckhart Tolle who calls it Presence, Ken Wilber who calls it Ever-Present Awareness and Byron Katie who simply calls it Reality. Call it what you will, Diane talks about the importance of cultivating our experience of Big Mind and elaborates on what that actually is.

 

 Integral Life – Diane talks about meeting Ken Wilber in 2004 and how his work and that of Integral Life has influenced her own life and work.

      <title>Ep. 15 - Mirabai Starr</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mirabai Starr is author of CARAVAN OF NO DESPAIR: A Memoir of Loss and Transformation, new translations of the Spanish mystics, John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila, and the award-winning book, GOD OF LOVE: A Guide to the Heart of Judaism, Christianity & Islam. She leads contemplative inter-spiritual retreats worldwide.
Episode Outline:

The Transformational Power of Loss – Mirabai and I discuss her new book, Caravan of No Despair and how she lays her entire heart and guts out in a raw and unabashed way for readers to see. We also discuss the transformational power of loss and how that can be a great catalyst for change and growth in our life.


On Suffering – Mirabai and I discuss Ram Dass’s quotes, “Suffering is the sandpaper of our incarnation. It does its job of shaping us” and how we can grow through our suffering. Mirabai also discusses the role the great mystic teachers can play in helping us to make sense of pain, loss and suffering.


On Healing – We’re all human and we’re all recovering from something, which is something Mirabai and I explore. We also talk about how bullshit spiritual niceties often don’t get the job done and what does work instead.
On Spirituality – In a previous conversation that Mirabai and I had, she said, “I don’t know any enlightened beings. I used to think that was the goal but I don’t think we get perfection and I know you know that. And so all we can do is be present for all of it, no matter how yucky, with humility, humor and gentleness.” We discuss that and many of the preconceived notions people tend to have about spirituality.


What Is God? – The title says it all, and Mirabai and I dive right in.


We Are The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For – Mirabai and I discuss the passing of the spiritual torch that seems to be taking place and how can we make sure that to keep the lines of communication and mentorship open between generations so as to not lose the very important heart transmission from these great wisdom teachers.

By combining the wisdom of his family’s traditions with the knowledge gained from his own personal journey, he now helps others realize their own path to personal freedom. Episode Outline: • The Rebellious Heart – Miguel discusses his teenage years growing up with brother don Jose Ruiz and their eclectic love of the arts, including the music of Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and The Cure, films such as the Lost Boys and Dead Poets Society (and more) and how they were often judged as not being “spiritual” as a result. • Spirituality, Don’t Pigeonhole It – Miguel discusses the importance of honoring our truths on the spiritual path and to see the spirituality in all of life rather than trying to pigeonhole it. He also talks about how honoring his truth led him to working in filmography earlier in his with such people as Missy Elliott, Michael Stipe and more. • Are you using knowledge, or is knowledge using you? – This was an extremely important question that Miguel’s grandmother asked him many years ago. Miguel goes on to discuss his shift in perspective and experience of knowledge. • Smokey Mirrors – Miguel discusses the Authentic Self and how it often becomes obscured as by the filters of, and our attachments to, our belief systems, something he calls the “Smokey Mirror”. • Self-Love and Acceptance – In his book, The Five Levels of Attachment, Miguel writes, “Of all the beliefs to detach from, this is the most important one: Let go of the attachment that you must obtain some image of perfection in order to be happy,” which he elaborates on in greater detail.]]>

      <title>Ep. 13 - Jessica Pimentel</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Bio
 
Jessica Pimentel may be most well known for her role as Maria Ruiz on the Netflix hit series, Orange Is The New Black, but she’s also an amazing musician who sings for Alekhine’s Gun (amongst other musical projects) and a longtime practitioner in the Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhist lineage.
 
Episode Outline:
 

Finding Your Way – Jessica outlines her early spiritual journey, which consisted of Christianity and bible study, Native American culture, Jainism, Judaism, Hinduism, Taoism and ultimately, Tibetan Buddhism.

 

 Hardcore Music – There’s an ever growing number of old school punk/hardcore “kids” that are finding their way into spirituality these days. Books such as Noah Levine’s Dharma Punx, Brad Warner’s Hardcore Zen and my own Indie Spiritualist speak to this. Jessica talks about what first attracted her to this music and going to the bands shows, as well as what’s kept her there since.

 

Hardcore Spirituality – Jessica and I discuss the correlation between the punk/hardcore movement that has led so many of its fans to exploring Buddhism and spirituality in general.

 

 Alekhine’s Gun – Jessica talks about the band Alekhine’s Gun, which she sings for as well as her other musical endeavors.

 

 Orange Is The New Black – Having been recorded early 2014, Jessica talks a bit about the hit show, it’s unexpected success, her favorite characters and the upcoming 2nd season (which has since aired).

 

 Service Work – Jessica talks about the opportunity Orange Is The New Black has given her to be of greater service to charities she supports including, The Women’s Prison Association, Ari Khensur Food Fund, Willie Mae Rock Camp For Girls, the Tsem Rinpoche Foundation and more.

      <title>Ep. 11 - Jamison Monroe</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[As a person in long term recovery from depression, trauma, self harm and substance abuse, compassionate and effective treatment of adolescent health is mission critical to Jamison Monroe. He is the Founder and CEO of Newport Academy, a series of healing centers for teens and families struggling with mental and behavioral health issues. With locations in California, Connecticut and New York City, Newport Academy encompasses four state of the art residential treatment programs, two comprehensive outpatient programs, and three nationally recognized therapeutic high schools designed specifically for teens in recovery.
 An Executive Producer of a truly game changing documentary about the prescription drug abuse epidemic among our nation's youth called Behind The Orange Curtain, Monroe, is a regular national news contributor on the topic of adolescent mental health to CNN, HLN, CBS and other major news outlets. Monroe has testified in front of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on the subject of teen prescription drug abuse.
As a cofounder of drugsoverdinner.org, Monroe is a big part of our nation having over 10,000 dinner conversations about the impact of drugs on our society and making a push to end the stigma associated with addictive behaviors.
Monroe’s global impact has been recognized by a host of international dignitaries and his tireless efforts have earned him several accolades including the illustrious Mona Mansell Award, which was presented to Jamison in 2014 by the Freedom Institute for his indelible mark on the addiction community and his passion for positive change.
Monroe currently resides in New York City and serves on the board of directors for several non-profits and some of the world’s most progressive creative thinking projects such as the Inspiration Foundation and the Global Adolescent Project. Jamison Monroe continues to raise the bar wherever his passion and commitment take him.

      <title>Ep. 4 - Keli Lalita</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Keli is an ex-punkrocker, mother of three amazing kids. She joined the Hare Krishna’s when she was 19, but she remembers loving Krishna way before then. She and her husband Saci own Equal Vision Records. Keli also teaches yoga, chant kirtan and loves dark chocolate with peanut butter.
• Hare Krishna – Keli discusses her childhood in upstate New York and how at 7 years old, while visiting a nearby ashram, she saw a picture of the universal form of Krishna, which led to an immediate heart and soul experience for her. She also discusses the influence that the Mahabharata Comic Books and movie Gandhi had on her at an early age.
• Rebellious Spirit –Keli and I take a stroll down punk/hardcore memory lane as we discuss our introductions to it during our teenage years. From Keli seeing Black Flag in 1986 to our parents supporting our involvement in the punk/hardcore scene and much more, we cover a lot of old school ground.
• Krishna-Core – Keli discusses playing guitar with the legendary hardcore band 108 while living at a Vivekananda ashram. She also recounts other Krishna bands and members such as Shelter, Prema, Ray Cappo (Ragunath), John Porcelly and more. She also shares about the time she tried to describe 108 to Krishna Das and his response. 13:38
• Equal Vision – Keli shares talks about her and her husband Saci’s record label Equal Vision, which has been a staple in the punk/hardcore music movement since the 90’s and how it continues to be today.
• Mantrology – From Equal Vision to Mantrology, Keli talks about her and Saci’s bhakti record label which has became a seva for them as all of their profits go to supporting foundations such as Food for Life Vrindavan, a school for very poor children in Northern India: Share Your Care, a mobile eye clinic for rural villagers in India, which is under the direction of Radhanath Swami, Off the Mat Into the World, through the students of Seane Corne. Mantralogy also partners with The Call and Response Foundation, an organization that brings Sacred Music to at risk youth, and into prisons.]]>
