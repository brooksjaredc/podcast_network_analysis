			<description><![CDATA[With the abrupt cancellation of our Barstool brethren's Barstool Van Talk by ESPN we had to re-release the first ever Podcast Diss Track. If you want to try and defame the name of our friends and Michael Rapaport, you're sorely mistaken. Joined for the first time by I AM RAPAPORT: STEREO PODCAST Producer Jordan Winter to break down the how Michael disagreeing with Dan Le Batard's views on the Los Angeles Lakers hiring Magic Johnson as the President of Basketball Operations lead to his "producers" taking offense.

They want beef. We want action. The slandering of The Gringo Mandingo on Twitter and subsequently on Monday's Dan Le Batard show by The Cupcake Kid, Jon Weiner aka The Yes Man of Long Island and the Coffee Boys of Miami is all well and good but now it's time to hear it from the WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON.

			<description><![CDATA[Michael Rapaport aka The Gringo Mandingo sits down with the Fantasy Football Beast of the East, the West, The North and the South, ESPN's Matthew Berry.

Then we really turn up the heat about things that have us Red Hot: Sly Stallone having a Celebrity Death Hoax, Khloe Kardashian making her rounds around the NBA without taking into account retired players, Penn State about to honor Joe Paterno, Sick F*ck of the Week, Lyin' Brian Williams' new show, The Williams Sisters tennis tenacity, Aaron Rodgers being a human sleeping pill and a No Good Judge segment!

			<description><![CDATA[In this Variety Show Episode that began immediately following UFC 202 with the raw reaction from The Gringo Mandingo aka Michael Rapaport about McGregor vs Diaz. Before calling in an expert on the topic, Michael closes out the 2016 Olympic Summer Games as only he can.  Brendan Schaub (Former UFC Heavyweight, contestant on The Ultimate Fighter & co-host of The Fighter and The Kid aka Rapaport and The Fighter) discuss the main event at UFC 202, the McGregor vs Diaz rematch, who McGregor would need to face to make the most money possible and the late, great Kimbo Slice. After that call the I AM RAPAPORT: VARIETY SHOW roles on with Michael taking the baton solo to discuss Fantasy Football in The Howard Stern Show League, Michael recording the opening for WWE Summerslam, 2 I AM RAPAPORT WORLD TOUR dates announced, the Sick F*ck of the Week and a whole lotta mo'. For the next leg of the race, Gerald Moody aka The Black Ed McMahon calls in to discuss our upcoming shows in Las Vegas & Phoenix, a No Good Judge, Bette Midler, White Lives Matter trending on Twitter and Team USA Men's Basketball.  In the home stretch Dean Collins aka The Young Shooter calls in to chop it up with Michael and is pressed for a Young Shooter Story that's put an extra skip in his step.

			<description><![CDATA[The I AM RAPAPORT: STEREO PODCAST is Certified Platinum and hotter than a heat wave. Michael Rapaport aka the Gringo Mandingo and Gerald Moody aka The Black Ed McMahon are the coast to coast hosts with the most! Michael owns up to losing the NBA Finals bet that him and Gerald aka Co-Hostradamus made but Michael is none too happy that Gerald is "holding LeBron's bags" after being complicit in bashing him for the last 19 months (as chronicled in EP167 aka the LeBron James Bash Extravaganza). Bringing a title to the (Waste)Land but stopping in Las Vegas first with J.R. Smith going buckfool! Michael thinks Warriors put up a good fight and losing this year may be the best thing that could happen to them in the long run. As we enter the DOG DAYS of Summer the I AM RAPAPORT: STEREO PODCAST is hitting the road July 28-July 31st to perform live shows in Minnesota, Milwaukee and Chicago. RAPAPACK WE NEED YOUR HELP! Our dream guest for Milwaukee is Latrell Sprewell LIVE and we need to create a hysteria to make this happen. Danny Aiello stops by to discuss the Sick F*cks in China at the Yulin Dog Eating Festival and Michael becomes defensive of Weezy. We're discussing O.J. Made In America Parts 4 & 5 aka Bizarro O.J.Land, a different Riley Curry getting sent death threats via the mail, National Selfie Day, preachy Vegans, being a race non-conforming individual and a famous fake ass.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[The I AM RAPAPORT: STEREO PODCAST is Certified Platinum and hotter than a heat wave. Michael Rapaport aka the Gringo Mandingo and Gerald Moody aka The Black Ed McMahon are the coast to coast hosts with the most! Michael owns up to losing the NBA Finals bet that him and Gerald aka Co-Hostradamus made but Michael is none too happy that Gerald is "holding LeBron's bags" after being complicit in bashing him for the last 19 months (as chronicled in EP167 aka the LeBron James Bash Extravaganza). Bringing a title to the (Waste)Land but stopping in Las Vegas first with J.R. Smith going buckfool! Michael thinks Warriors put up a good fight and losing this year may be the best thing that could happen to them in the long run. As we enter the DOG DAYS of Summer the I AM RAPAPORT: STEREO PODCAST is hitting the road July 28-July 31st to perform live shows in Minnesota, Milwaukee and Chicago. RAPAPACK WE NEED YOUR HELP! Our dream guest for Milwaukee is Latrell Sprewell LIVE and we need to create a hysteria to make this happen. Danny Aiello stops by to discuss the Sick F*cks in China at the Yulin Dog Eating Festival and Michael becomes defensive of Weezy. We're discussing O.J. Made In America Parts 4 & 5 aka Bizarro O.J.Land, a different Riley Curry getting sent death threats via the mail, National Selfie Day, preachy Vegans, being a race non-conforming individual and a famous fake ass.

They're discussing the podcast getting so much love on SporstCenter by Scott Van Pelt (who has an open invitation to the Gloom Tomb), the I AM RAPAPORT TOUR hitting the Midwest (July 27-31 in Minnesota, Milwaukee & Chicago), Gerald being thoroughly embarrassed by this crazy person O.J. Simpson aka The Great American Sambo because of O.J. Made In America 30 For 30, another No Good Judge, a prediction about D TRUMP from G MOODY, a Sick F*ck of the Week that involves Adult Baby Syndrome and Michael gets Bizarro Curry's Burner phone number as he wonders the streets of Cleveland.

They're both displaced from their homes but that can't stop/won't stop them from dropping bombs. Michael is all hopped up on Chocolate and a Cavs loss to get things fired up.

Draymond Green is lucky not to be suspended, Dahntay Jones with his Sucka Sh*t, the son of a Platinum Era Stickman and Steve Kerr's lack of lips are all up against The Firing Squad. If anyone knows how to play Dirty on the hardwood (No Bruno) it's Michael Rapaport. After NBA talk we enter into the Billboard Music Awards world because Rock N' Roll is Fininto, ladies making Michael blush and Madonna's singing voice need to be addressed. People who need to step aside for good : Tom Brady, Oklahoma Lawmakers who want to impeach President Obama and the Staten Island Sick F*ck of the Week.

			<description><![CDATA[I AM RAPAPORT is made for the people. The plan was to release our interview with Tom Green but The Grammy's has Michael Rapaport out of his cage and on the mic. Michael is disappointed by the lack of care for Hip Hop ("The last form of original music") and those who passed at The Grammy's (RIP Sean Price). Taylor Swift and her crew were looking to set it off. Why is Kanye West still talking about her anyways? Michael bought Life of Pablo and breaks down his initial feelings about it after listening to it through 3x. Yes, Michael buys music. He does not support downloading music and does not support that most of the All Time greats have to tour until the wheels come off because they don't make enough money. Shout outs to Alice Cooper, Kendrick Lamar, Stevie Wonder, Michael's public endorsement of Bernie Sanders for President of The United States of America and more. This episode is not to be missed! Pre-Order Soft Ass T's are now available for purchase. The "Jake", "G-Moneti" & "Black, Green & Red Black History Month Logo".

			<description><![CDATA[Michael Rapaport is back in Los Angeles, coming to you LIVE from the VROOM TOMB (Credit: The Rapapack) aka Michael's sh*t box SUV and you're in for a treat! First of all, Happy Chanukah to our Jewish fans (see Amazon list below for gift suggestions) as we kick off the holiday season with delight. Michael is elated after sweeping Fantasy Football NFL Sunday in the Emotional Friends League. Not only did he defeat Howard Stern Show Producer Gary Dell'abate and earn a first round bye in the playoffs next week but he won a $5,000 bet vs. ESPN Fantasy Football Guru Matthew Berry that he needs to donate to charity. Rapaport's Delight has won the war! Michael has a bone to pick with the NY Daily News, Mad Shaming, iPhone elbow, an actor friend who thinks Kanye West (and his sneakers) has been more impactful on music than Stevie Wonder (and his compassionate wig piece). There is good in the world to be talked about too! Michael's upcoming Juliette Lewis documentary, The BeatNuts Record of the Week and hero Doctors who are giving wounded warriors a new loaf on life.

			<description><![CDATA[Michael is back in the mobile gloom tomb, driving, podcasting and ranting around Los Angeles. First we take a moment to recognize those afflicted by terror worldwide. Our thoughts, prayers and feelings go out to you. We hope this episode brings you joy. Michael has some thoughts on how to deal with anyone worldwide who avoids eye contact, talks greasy, has bad breath or doesn't comply with instructions while. Then we turn it up to 450 because recently @MichaelRapaport was a part of a witch hunt on Twitter over his comments about Aziz Ansari sounding white. Just like Rosie Perez sounds Puerto Rican, Danny Aiello sounds Italian and Mark Wahlberg sounds like an Irish dude from South Boston. Michael stands by his comments and brings the thunder about this event, offering $1,000 cash to any fake wannabe analysts that want to come at him or the I AM RAPAPORT podcast talking greasy. Those who hid behind fake names and avatars but want to pop off anonymously are and need to be dealt with. We are doing a #StopTheMadShamingWalk2016. Mad is the opposite of happy and it's OK to be mad. You Mad Bro? Yes! Stop the mad shaming! Ronda Rousey has to be discussed. She's never been hit in the mouth and got exposed. Joe Rogan has an open invitation to come on the podcast and Michael wants to go on JLE to discuss with him. If a movie called "White Men Can't Jump" came out today would people be offended? If you see Michael on the streets and want a Soft Ass T, let him know! If you want to donate to Gerald's home/Gloom Tomb in the Boogie Down Bronx then you can donate to below. Once we hit the the goal we are going to have a party at the BX GLOOM TOMB. Gerald calls in to talk about that, WIGGA PLEASE, NBA WIG PIECE'S & TOM BRADY. This episode is not to be missed!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Michael and G Moody are coming at you from money making Manhattan with the realness. Kicking it off is commentary about an interview with THE Danny Aiello that we recorded that will be released for Episode 100 so stay tuned for that. Speaking of Aiello, he's got some words for anyone that doesn't like Michael and Gerald hanging out with Howard Stern Alumni Joey Boots & High Pitch Eric. With judgement passed on them they pass judgement on I AM CAIT, rubber loafs, Diva NFL Wide Receivers and Rookie Quarterbacks. The icing on the cake is a Scarface Al Pacino Line of the Week performed by Michael Rapaport. Make sure you stay tuned until the very end of this episode folks! Tell your kids, your cousins, your Grandmamas and Papas that the dynamic duo has done it again!]]></description>

Michael can't wait for you all to see him as Charlie Bullman on Edward Burns/Steven Spielberg's Public Morals, August 25th on TNT.

			<description><![CDATA[Michael is in the West Coast Gloom Tomb with the lone red rabid wolf, comedian Bill Burr. They first met making the movie "The Heat" with Sandra Bullock & Melissa McCarthy and are collecting their $42 residual checks to this day. They talk Bill's stand up comedy mentality, how he gets better, what he's working on for his act and what he's learned from other great comedians. Michael and Bill still love working on and watching movies but Michael doesn't f*ck with comic book movies (even though he'd be in one). Since Michael has done so many movies Bill wants to know if Michael knows if a movie is going to be bad when he gets to set. Michael has a special story about a film with a big name star that he did that he calls "a piece of sh*t" and why it was a f*cking disaster. The gloves start to come off in this one! This episode is not to be missed! Stay tuned for BILL BURR - PART 2: WAR.]]></description>

Michael and Gerald recount sneaking down courtside next to George Gervin to see Year 2 Michael Jordan play at MSG. 25 year old Gerald and Michael going to Minnesota to make Beautiful Girls. While there they would go nuts at Prince's Disco with white women and NBA players. There's a special J.R.

Gerald was always looking out for Michael who was told not to wander off. G Moody recounts the first time he came to L.A. to visit Michael and how they'd go to the Improv to see the hottest new comics. Growing up with former NBA player and Brooklyn legend Kenny Anderson, taking a joy ride around L.A. in a "borrowed" Trans Am and a run in with the cops that included eggs and Ricky Shroeder.]]></description>

These two thespians discuss Matt's rise to fame from personal trainer/body builder to part time actor to star on two hit TV series'. Michael has all kinds of questions for Matt especially when it comes to working on set with so many women and which cast members Matt would want to live on a stranded island with. Michael talks about being on Friends and Fresh Prince of Bel Air and cashing those $.17 residual checks. Matt speaks on the difference between a network show and a Netflix show, people's reactions to him on the street, Feminism, Caitlyn Jenner, most impressive actor's he's worked with and how much of a stickman he is (one who's willing to repopulate the planet if he has to), jail mail and the upstate NY escaped murderers.

			<description><![CDATA[Michael and Gerald are coming to you live from the West Coast Gloom Tomb to discuss the defining moments of the NBA season. Michael thinks that the youth of the NBA is taking over for better or for worse. For worse would be J.R. Smith bringing a scooter to Game 6 to the NBA Finals. Michael and Gerald GO IN on LeBron James for claiming to be a great leader/best player in the world and allowing J.R. to behave like this. They recount what would've happened if J.R. was on the Lakers, Celtics, Sixers, Bulls teams of the 80's/90's. Danny Aiello and Chris Broussard chime in. Michael takes aim at LeBron James' acting in the new Judd Apatow movie 'Trainwreck'. One more thing on Rachel Dolezal being light skinned and the difference that makes in the black community. The L.A. Tour with Gerald rolls on and he airs his frustrations about people coming up to Michael and pitching things to him on the streets. Part 1 of the HISTORY of how Michael & G Moneti met and their adventures together.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[TGIFrom the Gloom Tomb! Michael is here to bring you the 5 minutes of Friday funk but he's feeling it today and it's going to be longer. Michael's Mom is in the hospital for getting kicked by a horse (send love and well wishes to @MichaelRapaport) which leads Michael to talk about the time he let a new dog in his house and he gave him one of those "looks". The PEOPLE have spoken and they want Michael to f*ck Matthew Berry and the rest of the Howard Stern Wrap Up Show burnouts where they breathe.

Michael wants YOU the listeners to help pick a middle name for Gerald. Let us know what you think. We talk signature terms such as loaf, sugar dicking and your F style is buckwild. It's opening day of Major League Baseball and the New York predictions for the upcoming season are brought up including the difference between Mets fans and Yankee fans and ARod. The line of the week comes from Saturday Night Fever. Batter up leads to talk of Derek Jeter (a guy whose F style is buckwild) being retired from baseball which leads to talk of some of the greatest stickmen aka cocksmen of today including a story that Sylvester Stallone told Michael about a great stickman while they were filming Cop Land. They marvel at some of the all time great stick men. Going back to baseball, the convesation turns to Sammy Sosa and what he's been up to lately and how beauty has changed in pop cultur]]></description>
