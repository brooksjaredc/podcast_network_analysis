      <title>Scott Thompson - Butter Him Up! (Live From SF Sketchfest)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week, the Sklars and Dan Van Kirk are joined by Scott Thompson (The Kids in the Hall) live from SF Sketchfest! In Story 1, a man sets the garage on fire in retaliation after his roommate draws phallic symbols on his face while he was passed out. Story 2 introduces us to a man who tries to jump the gates at the London underground, only to get stuck in an uncomfortable and compromising position. In Story 3, we find out which objects Americans shoved inside themselves in 2017, and learn why a flared base is so essential. Then, the townies in the audience share some stories, including tales of cocaine at a court hearing, a sloppy ATM jacking, and arson in a public toilet. Finally, Kris Kristofferson drops by to share a story from the set of the movie Blade: Trinity.&nbsp;</p>]]>

In Story #2, a man simply tries to hand out some candy... naked and covered in feces. The group discusses the Tig Notaro walking tour, and Tig's amazing Ryan Gosling story. Story #3 brings a "Dirty Dancing"-themed mishap. To cap it all off, a fan-made rap: "Today Was Not a Good Day."</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>This week, Kumail Nanjiani&nbsp;(The Big Sick, Silicon Valley) starts a Grand Theft Auto mission and winds up in Dumb People Town! Kumail talks to the Sklars and Daniel Van Kirk about his smash hit movie "The Big Sick," working with Ray Romano, and how tricky it can be to make a movie about standup.  In Story #1, a man needs a LOT of help after becoming intimately involved with a wrench. Kumail discusses writing and making "The Big Sick," and trying to portray characters from the stand up scene that feel true. In Story #2, thieves leave behind copious evidence after stealing devices that are literally made to be tracked.  The group discusses Kumail's character arc on the latest season of Silicon Valley and Kumail's family's reaction to his movie before diving into Story #3, in which a man with a lethal snake bite doesn't react quite how you'd expect.  Robert Durst leaves a voicemail about his new piñata business.</p>]]>

      <title>Sal Vulcano - Not A Lot, I Can Get It For You</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week, Sal Vulcano (Impractical Jokers) rides a bright orange ferry over to Dumb People Town!  The Sklars and Daniel Van Kirk talk to Sal about the lasting success of Impractical Jokers.  In Story #1, a couple gets caught in compromising positions in a restaurant parking lot, and a woman gives a police officer a flower.  The group discusses the Crapshoot Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, Dan's favorite Impractical Jokers bit, and Sal's thigh tattoo.  Story #2 brings a violent cinema-goer who is tripping balls and seeing reptilians.  Story #3 kicks off with a police report about stolen marijuana and somehow only gets dumber from there.  A voicemail from Kris Kristofferson about a drug-fueled movie-going experience seals the deal.]]>
