(and just about every other show imaginable) its the one and only John O’Heir.  John dishes on coming up through the acting ranks, which tv show was the worst to work on, and what it was like to get really really close to Chris Pratt.  With Matt Weiss in Africa, comedian guest host Ari Mannis fills in perfectly, as John’s role in Middle Man is a comedian who picks up a hitch hiking manager on his way to vegas and gets alot more than the new career he is aiming for.  Listen and then go see the film!</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Is Howie Mandel returning to America's Got Talent next year?!  Allegedly has the man himself in the hot seat where he talks why he may NOT be returning to AGT and his reported &quot;feud&quot; with Howard Stern!  Ironically, the conversation gets pretty dirty when Howie reveals the worst place he's ever performed at... how his son once fell into a bag of doo doo... and of course, the one celebrity crush that got away (hint:  he'd shake her hand now because she's very clean).  With tales of Spike Lee and Road Rules tours, Howie will have to pick a winner... but it's not who you think.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>The game is on when 98 Degrees band member Jeff Timmons stops by the podcast to judge which host has sunk lower - the one who stole cupcakes from Neil Patrick Harris's birthday party or the one who didn't recognize Wayne Gretzky and asked him to take a picture of himself with someone else?  Timmons also divulges some of his own tales from his many years in La-La Land including what it was like having lady boy groupies in Thailand, that time he got catfished, and the famous actress who tried to woo him by putting on her own movies while they made out.

      <itunes:summary>&quot;America's Got Talent&quot; finalist comic Drew Lynch fills the celebrity judge chair on this episode of &quot;Allegedy with Theo Von &amp; Matthew Cole Weiss&quot;.  After winning over the hearts of America, the speech-impaired comedian earned a free pass straight to the finals of the competition where he plans on battling it out to the end this month.  But before that, he had to come by the podcast to talk about the &quot;AGT&quot; judges and become a judge himself to some of the most embarrassing Hollywood stories you ever heard (hint:  someone pretended they had Parkinson's disease to impress a famous actor).  </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>The man, the myth, the T-shirts.  Legendary writer, comedian, and multiple Emmy Award winner Bruce Vilanch stops by to judge the &quot;Allegedly&quot; podcast.  Sure, he's written for the Academy Awards, starred on Broadway, been immortalized on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, but he's never been subjected to the torture that is Matt and Theo.  Vilanch spills the dirt on the celebrities who are mad at him, the myth of the &quot;closeted&quot; celebrity, and what Bill Cosby is really like.  In the end, Vilanch has to consider stories involving Scott Baio and Jerry Mathers to ultimately decide who wins the episode.  </itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>He may play Rachel McAdams's boy toy on True Detective, but Hollywood stud Riley Smith is the one to get interrogated in this premiere episode of Allegedly with Theo Von and Matthew Cole Weiss.  The never aging star talks getting high with Woody Harrelson, the famous actress who tried to get his number, and what it's like to be eskimo brothers with one of the hosts (you'll never guess which one).  In the end, Smith has to pick which host won the podcast, though with embarrassing stories involving Kirk Douglas and Ice Cube, he sure has his work cut out for him.</itunes:summary>
