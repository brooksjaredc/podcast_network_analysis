			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #182: Mark Steel - Cunt or Wanker. It's the end of the series and Rich wonders how tourists in Kings Cross will feel if their last action on earth is to queue to stand by a fictional wall. His guest is a man who has a lot of stories about how he got into comedy, it's Mark Steel. They chat about eating pork pies with Joseph Heller, helping failed escapologists, an idea for a brand new Radio 4 panel show, whether you can stand for political office and still be a comedian, the extraordinary story of Mark's birth parents, what it's like having a child going into comedy, and getting your own back on a snooty Darwin expert. It's a fabulous end to what has surely been the best series yet. Will the commissioners bring the show back? Yes of course they will - more in September (and a couple of specials coming out before then too).

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #181: My Dad Wrote A Porno - Vaginal Lids. Rich cannot win game shows even in his dreams, but is also convinced that he might be a robot, but these are small worries compared to his guests, Jamie, Alice and James from the My Dad Wrote A Porno podcast. Find out how the gang met; what they blasted into space; why and how they came up with the idea for their world-defeating podcast; the mystery of female genitalis; rivets on the Titanic; celebrity fans; and can the paedo postman make it into the film version of the podcast? Also why you must always check for hogs; whether colour or taste is preferable to alter in an ejaculation; pepparami penises; and, unsurprisingly, a whole lot of filth.

The Porno guys are playing the Albert Hall on 21st June. It's probably sold out, but check for tickets here: https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2018/my-dad-wrote-a-porno/

They talk about how a trip to Ibiza with your techno-loving gran can ignite a love of theatre; what Rylan is like in real life; the therapeutic nature of stand-up (and whether it's healthy to work things through on stage); the intersection between madness and comedy; growing up in and out of care; thinking Richard Ashcroft is your dad; and why comedy and theatre are so middle class. Plus is it always best to be in a monogamous relationship; and how much is comedy like sex work? If you've seen Richard dancing, then not very much.

Richard continues to be surprised by the difference of living in the country and surprises his neighbours with his specialised knowledge about genitalia, but is very excited to be welcoming American superstar comedian Maria Bamford. They talk about the difficulty of telling a joke to people who find out you're a comedian; how some people have no sense of humour; the difficulty of making love to music; how charity only has any value if it's in public; the power of unwanted thoughts; and turning the worst moments of your life into comedy. Also, how to deal with spousal arguments; the two words that hooked Maria's husband; and using your family for comedic purpose. Luckily Maria proves to be all you would hope and more. Hooray for that.

We had been Blessed. Thankfully we had at least had a week to recover. It's a somewhat calmer podcast, with some questions in it and a couple of words from the host, including some dark suggestions for new Muppet movies, Neil Buchanan's dental hygiene, unusual prophylactics, how improv got cool, Sunday services for the non-religious, rocking with Baptists, getting career goals in perspective, the wonders of Music Hall and basing characters on your 17 year-old self. I mean, she's no Brian Blessed, but thank God for that.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #175: BRIAN BLESSED!!!! What Was The Question? It's finally come to pass. The podcasts can end now, because the whole point of starting them up has been achieved. Richard's guest is a man who has played all theatrical parts, but most notably the part of Brian Blessed. I couldn't even begin to describe what happened on this extraordinary night, except to say it is was a bona fide happening. Try and predict how many words Richard will say in this. It's a free form and extraordinary, yet sometimes beautiful and inspiring, journey through the career, philosophy and madness of a man who might be the greatest living Englishmen. How much of it is true? I can't tell you. But at least some of it. Includes sticking it to Picasso, toileting on a mountain, biting umbilical cords, working with the young Peter O'Toole and Patrick Stewart, never dying and probably some other stuff. I can't tell you. I had a little nap through most of it. Worth watching the video version to see my torture on what was one of the best experiences of my life. This podcast is absolutely unbeatable.

Brian's book 'The Panther In My Kitchen: My Wild Life With Animals' is available now: https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/150984158X/comedyguide-21/

Spoiler Alert- of course not, but never mind because he's about to meet the man behind almost every great comedy star of the last 20 years, it's Too Gorgeous Peter 'Too Gorgeous' Baynham. The ex-flat mates discuss what happens when a 16 year-old Frank Spencer is put in charge of a super tanker; the most inappropriate way to greet the death of someone's loved one; who was right in the war over bread; Jean Valjean bumming people while looking like Peter Baynham; what it's like to meet Adam Sandler; how Peter nearly turned down Borat and somehow didn't turn down Arthur; what Chris Morris is like in real life (he's nice); the lost answerphone messages that could destroy careers; Lee and Herring's part in the creation of I'm Alan Partridge; running away from an audience; and the mad thoughts that plague the diseased minds of (at least these two) comedians.

His guest is a comedian who proves that it's possible to be wise, sane and still funny, Katherine Ryan. They discuss their shared and slightly disappointingly vanilla DNA heritage; how to plan a city; wanting to marry Adam Sandler; if Jimmy Carr has time to spend his money; why comedians want to be taken seriously when being funny is much harder and better; things that you abhorred as a child but you like now; catching out cheating partners; why anyone would get married; and how to be happy in life.

After an awkward chat with an accountant and a student, it's time to meet the stars of the All Killa No Filla podcast, Rachel Fairburn and Kiri Pritchard-McLean. They talk about whether serial killers are the stand-up comedians of the world of crime; whether any comedians have made the crossover into serial killing; what drives our obsession with the darkness of true crime and how that can sometimes go way too far. Also discussed are meeting Noel Gallagher; running marathons with the bloke off My Parents Are Aliens; being on a plane with Bez; and doing a Muppet Christmas Carol in 6 minutes.

Rich forgot to do a bit of his tour show for the people of Cardiff so we start with a comity contest, which unexpectedly leads to the podcast being blocked by penguins. Rich's guest this week is the laid back, all-round genius Mackenzie Crook. Will Rich screw things up as badly as last time he had someone from The Office on? Not quite, but he gives it a fair go. They chat about double-teaming Muppets, the best metal detector, why UK sitcoms are so short-lived, remaking The Office, choosing a field in Suffolk over a ship in the Caribbean, how easy it is to ride a tube train and what happened with Sex Lives Of The Potato Men. All this and Rich has a barely noticeable spot on his nose. No wonder he's out of sorts. The twit.

Rich's daughter seems to be on her way to a mediocre career in comedy and he could not be more proud, but he doesn't have time to show off too much as RHLSTP is welcoming its second member of parliament, Jess Phillips. There's chat about the positive side of Brexit, the impressive thing about UKIP, why the left wing are at a disadvantage when it comes to changing things, why International Men's Day is not advancing the cause of men, the disappointing representation of lifts in popular movies, the truth about whether Jess told Diane Abbott to f*** off and whether it's best to have kids young or old. Also who is the sexiest Tory MP? Plus how safe are our elected representatives, and are MPs as bad as everyone makes out? And Rich announces his intention to stand for parliament.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #168: Danielle Ward - Sting's Bloody Toilet. Technology delivers a cruel blow to Richard as it deletes his carefully crafted opening monologue about Cheddar Man, but he has a crack at it from memory. Richard is giddy from tiredness caused by nasty bugs from his stupid children and his guest, Danielle Ward, had a complicated and scary birth only 13 weeks ago, so it's no surprise that things go a bit giddy and occasionally over the top. How many revelations about Prince Andrew and Dame Judy Dench will make it to air? Not very many is my guess. This is why you should come along and see the show live if you can: https://leicestersquaretheatre.ticketsolve.com/shows/873492663. Find out what it's like to work as an economic researcher at the South Korean embassy (when you know nothing about the economy or Korea); which member of Lee and Herring Danielle wrote to in 1996; the difficulty of transferring a successful podcast to television; and what the most popular TV show of 1970 was. Find out about two moments from the life of Benedict Cumberbatch; how Rich bonded with Adrian Chiles; and why Danielle loves Debbie McGee. You will just have to imagine the bits we had to cut out (and if you listen to some of the bits that stayed in, you're going to wonder how far we actually went).

Fired up by his first TV recording in 23 years, Richard decides to work harder on his opening monologue, but is surprised to find how little he's actually done, but at least there's one in the eye for Kettle Crisps and luckily his guests are radio and podcast sensations John Robins and Elis James. They discuss pant retirement etiquette, being in a double act that actually like each other (for now), the curse of the Independent comedy couples photo shoot, the most money that's ever changed hands for GCSE art coursework, the power of being a fan, Celebrity Mastermind humiliations and how not to respond to criticism. Plus who will survive the Josh Widdicombe/John Robins showdown?

Richard's living in a house of horrors and has heard a ghost, so he's glad to be back in the safety of lovely, undangerous London to find out if Kathy Burke is as cool and amazing in real life as you really hope that she is. She's cooler than the coolest cool kids. They chat about the many paths taken from Educating Marmalade, where you might unknowingly have first encountered Kathy, when Perry met the Manics, who is best Harry Enfield or Gary Oldman, a reluctant visit to Cannes, why Burke moved from acting to directing and the joys of Oscar Wilde. Also featuring Horne and Corden, the Mona Lisa and not being in Doctor Who. A new notebook, new chairs and new microphones - sorry audiophiles about the last one of those - we will be back to uncrackly next week.

And the audience decides on who should be invited on to the next series.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #161: Johann Hari - Cannibal Chicken. The question of ham hands versus suncream armpits has gone international and been introduced to a new generation in the most charming of ways. But hat confusion, decade old Big Brother news and chicken restaurants aside, it's a pretty serious podcast in which journalist Johann Hari discusses his fascinating new book, 'Lost Connections'. Are our views on depression and antidepressants correct or do we need to look at these subjects in a new way? Johann discusses how an encounter with an apple made him consider the importance of listening to our symptoms, plus the power that people have to overcome the systems that can make them sad or even give up hope entirely. Is Rich's dad crazy for wanting to engage with strangers or is Rich insane for being disconnected from his neighbours? Do possessions bring us happiness? Do lesbian monkey orgies have anything to teach us? And what can bring Muslims, punks and gay men together? No emergency questions. Unless you consider the future of the human race an emergency.

Richard is overly proud of himself for having created a new book of Emergency Questions, but luckily there is someone on hand who will give them short shrift, it's the comedian with the soul of a poet, Reginald D Hunter. He discusses the one thing that is better than a shrek when it comes to improving existing franchises; how Reg did and didn't break his leg; how comedic genius can be passed on via the bladder; the ultimate victory of sibling rivalry; the slow realisation of the truth about OJ Simpson; how vanity is the greatest destroyer of men; being the fourth funniest person in your family; and many more surprising revelations regarding relativity. Richard worries about ageing and death, but Reginald does not. It's a revelatory chat with a comedian who possibly unwittingly inspired this whole podcast series. You will dream of loving someone as much as Rich loves Reg.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #159: Richard Osman - Drifter Charger. Rich's daughter has made quite a radical life choice, but hopefully is a reincarnation of someone who will make the family a lot of money (if only we can prove it). This week it's a welcome return for one of the worst guests we've ever had on RHLSTP (and I am saying that because that's what he says about me on Pointless), it's the charmingly offensive giant, Richard Osman. Will Osman realise where he's gone wrong with his TV shows and finally commission Richard to write and sing the theme tune? Will Pointless ever take the money and head to Channel 4? What will Osman say about Rich's mum this time? Why can't chocolate manufacturer's put aside their differences? How big is a glass? Is it OK to propose to someone over Twitter? How many times can you lose on Pointless and still hold your head high? What do the Chinese think of Osman? Is it better to be single in your twenties or your forties? As you'd expect it's a wide-ranging chat and a delight from start to finish.

Richard freewheels about the poor quality of the suit he has had to wear as his nice ones no longer fit him, still giddy from a heady cocktail of tiredness and grief, but he's in for a relaxed and thoughtful hour, with a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks, John Moloney. They chat about Red Wedge, accordions, out-Catholicing Frank Skinner, performing in German and John's bold plans to create 'Dead At The Apollo' a showcase for comedians over 50. Some lovely stuff about overcoming chips on shoulders and some cheerleading for the unlikely twosome of Jeremy Corbyn and Jim Davidson. Also who is best science or Jesus?

Richard freewheels about the poor quality of the suit he has had to wear as his nice ones no longer fit him, still giddy from a heady cocktail of tiredness and grief, but he's in for a relaxed and thoughtful hour, with a man who is not afraid to say what he thinks, John Moloney. They chat about Red Wedge, accordions, out-Catholicing Frank Skinner, performing in German and John's bold plans to create 'Dead At The Apollo' a showcase for comedians over 50. Some lovely stuff about overcoming chips on shoulders and some cheerleading for the unlikely twosome of Jeremy Corbyn and Jim Davidson. Also who is best science or Jesus?

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #153: Rachel Parris - Oh Jesus I have Promised. Rich is confused and amazed by horses and apparently alone in being troubled by the lyrics to the new Stereophonics song, but he has a more skilled musician, improviser and ex-Christian rocker on hand to dig him out of his exhausted new-parent hole, it's Rachel Parris. They chat about obscure advertising jingles, how to improvise entire Jane Austen stories, the excitement of sitting on a 'celebrity's' toilet, usurping elderly organists, emailing the Samaritans, who's who (or anyone) in Game Of Thrones, poo wrangling and funky hymns.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #152: Armando Iannucci - Deeply Dippy. Richard is surprisingly appalled by what a sex robot inventor is planning for his sex robot and reeling from the brutal combo of no sleep and attending a funeral, but life goes on and it's laughter all the way (until the end when it gets a bit bleak) with left-wing Stalin apologist Armando Iannucci. Armando reveals a surprising friendship with a 1990s pop group and the dark underside of Michael Palin before trying to ascertain who is worst: Weinstein, Stalin or James Corden. Rich gets busted about his behaviour at the "Death of Stalin" premiere and there's lots of chat about this excellent film and how being a director has changed Iannucci into a megalomaniac. Plus find out what happened when Armando started to learn the piano in his 40s and his near death experiences on holiday and how he has once again managed to copy all of Richard's ideas and pass them off as his own.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #151: Ellie Taylor - Catching Clouds. RHLSTP is back and the sky has changed colour and the first of the gang has died, so Richard is a bit unsettled and sad. But on we plough until our own inevitable deaths. The guest today previously worked for Isis, it's Ellie Taylor, who claims to have grown up in Brentwood, but she doesn't know much about it or trampolining. Like you'd expect. They talk about the faces you pull when you're modelling for Matalan, being apparated in a box, the great Josh paedo postman betrayal, why cats are better than babies, having a heart made of diamonds, and much too much about genitals, but then some stuff about the cute things kids say to make up for the rudeness. Richard is so tired that his brain either says everything he is thinking or can't formulate basic words (so no real change there), but luckily Ellie is eloquent as he bumbles around the questions of body image and perceived attractiveness. Plus he gets to ask questions from the brand new EQ app!

Perhaps it would have been for the best. But instead he's back for the 150th official episode of the show that the Cool Kids call RHLSTP with one of his all-time favourite guests, Sara Pascoe. She has written a phenomenal book called Animal which you really should buy https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571325246/comedyguide-21/ for all teenage girls, all teenage boys and everyone else too. There's some pretty serious chat about the chemistry of love, biology, abortion, the future of the world, whether things are getting better or worse and terrible human nature. But it's contemplative and positive and proves that Richard isn't actually the worst man on the planet, plus there's fun stuff about Just A Minute in a brain scanning machine and Sunday Brunch (with surprise guest) and a brilliant new game show where there's guaranteed to be one woman on every week. Plus all the Emergency Questions lead us to serious answers. It's an amazing end to what has surely been the best series of RHLSTP so far.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #146: Limmy - Monopoly Penguin. Rich is on the cusp of a couple of massive life changes, but he won't let ageing and moving get in the way of asking comedians strange questions in an attempt to make them reveal intimate truths. Today he talks to a man with inventive ideas for revenge and murder, Limmy. They discuss being concreted into the pavement, manspreading, swearing xylophones, fake whatsapps, undescended testicles, sea lion genitals, how to save money when touring, the joy of travelling the world and seeing nothing but Columbo and dedicating a lot of time to the best tactics required to win at Monopoly.

Richard hasn't eaten enough in a last-ditch attempt to lose weight before he turns 50, but no time for stomach rumbles because his guest is professional Margaret Thatcher impersonator and teenage evangelical Christian, Katy Brand. Questions, emergency and non-emergency are asked, like how does Brian Blessed feel about hobgoblins? Where do demons go when they have been dispossessed? Are Medusa and Emily Bronte the only women in history? When is International Men's Day? What kind of a sad case would use crowdfunding? Have any of Richard's 1990s fans gone on to be less successful than him? And you'll witness the power of the new embers of a bonfire Emergency Question.

His first guest is Edinburgh Comedy Prize nominee Ahir Shah - they chat about Brexit, how looking into the sun proves your strength and wisdom and the older generations disregard for metaphorical ladders. His second guest is Edinburgh Comedy Prize nominee, Jon Robbins (sorry) John Robins. They talk about break ups, being in relationships with comedians, the way that Edinburgh haunts the long-term Fringe performer, a darker version of The Cobbler and how John loves to go to bed with his mum. Colin gets to quiz both guests and hopefully will be back with his own Edinburgh Fringe podcast next year. By the time you hear this you will probably know who is the winner and who are the losers, but here's the clip that John was talking about: Dustin Hoffmann Oscar speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhDmNRQgKLM (whizz through the noms if you like). Do check out both these guys shows at the Fringe or on tour.

You can buy the Emergency Questions book here - http://www.gofasterstripe.com/EQ. Thanks for joining us at the Fringe in this way. It's been a fun year. And maybe I will come back and do more of these another time. Really delighted to have resurrected it.</itunes:summary>

Rich is mortified about having accidentally crashed someone else's show and is thinking of becoming someone who pays to sit in a hairdressers. But the good news is that Colin is back to remind his guests of times that things have gone wrong for them. Rich's first guest personally knows many of the people that Rich not-so-secretly lusts over at CBeebies - it's Iain Stirling. They chat about working alongside puppets (in their own different ways), how Love Island has turned Iain into a huge Edinburgh smash, the tragedy behind the Amazing Bubble Man and whether somehow Richard might be Iain's dad. Then Richard is joined by the Radio Times Comedy champion and also champion poor time keeper, Jason Manford to chat about the old bamboo, setting up comedy clubs, bizarre coincidences and I think a misunderstanding about what a human centipede involves.

HIs guest went one step further than that, it's the wonderful comedy genius James Acaster. They discuss how hot chocolate is not a flavour, sky diving in slip-ons, the dangers of eating chicken nuggets for a bet, the behind-the-scenes disaster that happened on the Conan show, how a rubbish ghost train was made more scary, shooting Private Pike in the face, crashing cars and the ace sitcom We The Jury.

The King has returned and he's at the spooky New Theatre Grand Hall where the Masons get up to all sorts of mysterious time-travelling. And Richard is very excited to be welcoming comedy legends the Doug Anthony All Stars, Paul, Tim and Paul. There's lots of chat about the Edinburgh Fringe of the eighties, the point where comedy and tragedy meet, what happens when you become the carer for your comedy partner, what happens if you never wash your clothes, the Doug who became a diplomat, how Jerry Sadowitz terrorised the public, and curing rectal cancer. Sorry the first minute or so got lost, but I have attempted to recreate it (and it was nothing of any worth). Plus there's a beautiful song at the end which is going to leave you wondering why the audience is laughing, but suffice to say what was happening was very funny indeed.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #142: Brendon Burns and Craig Quartermaine - Race Off. Richard contemplates the now trickier commute to work that he has thanks to being forced to move to the country because he is 50, before introducing veteran comedian Brendon Burns and a man with only one credit, Craig Quartermaine. It's a more contemplative RHLSTP than usual, as the two Australians discuss the racial issues that many of their countrymen refuse to confront and how comedy can deal with questions of race (especially if a loud and mouthy bloke is teamed up with a quieter and indigenous one). Find out how this unlikely pair got together, how they reluctantly formed a double act, what makes a double act work and the awkwardness that both comedians revel in and have to cope with in their daily life and from people who have seen their show. It's a fascinating insight into guilt, embarrassment and the horrors of imperialism and how difficult it is to confront these harsh truths. Luckily it's funny too. Though sometimes uncomfortably so.

He's gone against the advice of last week's podcast and had a drink, and so has his guest, it's Classic FM's Andrew Collin(g)s. It's the first time the pair have spoken in over 60 months and it would be foolish to deny that there might be come tensions bubbling beneath (and all over) the surface, but there's still time for some banter that will take you back to the glory days of 2008-2011. Armed with emergency questions and an emergency folder of cherished tabloid memories the pair attempt to discuss the country's worst serial killers, the Mitfords, the evil of Cecil Parkinson, the debt they owe each other, the unresolved sexual tension (at least at the start of the evening), the disappointment of Northampton, decent and indecent proposals, whether it's OK to add cartoons to The Human Centipede and what the best kind of tape is.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #135: Paul Merton - Waiting For Crawford. It's back for an eleventh series - who keeps commissioning this? - and Richard's new emergency questions are coming true as he's fresh from irking a postman. His guest is someone who he used to only be able to speak to in drunken awe at early 1990s BBC Radio Light Entertainment parties, Paul Merton. They discuss their similarly comedy-nerdy teenage years, the early days of the alternative comedy circuit where Alexei Sayle's stream of swearing might be followed by flying fish or slowly melting ice. Can Paul remember the very first routine that helped him on the road to stardom (and partially define his persona)? - you bet a fortnight's holiday in Benidorm he can, and it's magical! Find out how close he came to death 30 years ago after breaking his leg and how anti-malarial drugs almost broke his brain.

I heartily recommend his funny and moving autobiography https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00D8HPBSI/comedyguide-21/

			<itunes:summary>Wells Comedy Festival Extra: Bec Hill - Passing The Baton. Rich has risked the wrath of everyone in his home town of Cheddar by travelling beyond the horizon to Wells, where the crazy people dwell, and doing a special podcast for the inhabitants. But don't worry Cheddar - he mocks the Wells insane asylum dwellers and won't let them get away with being called a city. He is armed with a copy, fresh off the presses of the new Emergency Questions book, which will be winging its way to kickstarter backers imminently and be available to buy at gigs and (very soon) from www.gofasterstripe.com. His guest is Australian exponent of the Japanese storytelling technique of Kamishibai, [citation needed] Bec Hill. They discuss what it is like to be married on stage (not to each other); unpleasant experiences with toilet rolls; and the strange way we allow a stranger with an X-Ray machine to focus; Adelaide's tallest building; being halfway somewhere; and find out if Bec has ever irked a postman. Plus some big news for Rich, inevitably sullied by inappropriate chat about genitalia.

The new series line-up is almost completely confirmed. Some amazing names coming up in Series 11 - Book tickets here: https://leicestersquaretheatre.ticketsolve.com/shows/873492663</itunes:summary>

It's the final episode of Series 10 of RHLSTP and Rich meets a bearded man who has married to find a partner (find out how he did it nerds). His guest is the laid-back and yet also intense (and rather beautiful) Peter Serafinowicz. They talk about how it's almost impossible to parody the new President of the United States, but the effective way that Peter managed it and his fears and plans should there be repercussions from the thin-skinned bellend. Also lots of chats about the two Brian Bs (Blessed and Butterfield) and how a stellar cast does not always lead to a commission. Plus behind the scenes at Guardians Of The Galaxy and Parks And Recreation and the Pudsey The Dog movie. Incredibly Adam Sandler's The Cobbler and the strange ego of Mr Tumble come up without Richard even mentioning them.

They chat about their varying success on quiz shows, how Danny Dyer saved 2016, what it's like being married to a Queen-loving giant and what it's like performing in front of a room full of babies. Also, how Kitchen Karaoke and Rich with his top off led to romance and how a sheep-shearer incensed turned a comedian into a heckler. See Richard on tour this spring.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #132: Simon Munnery - Don't Die. Richard quizzes his audience to find how little they have done with their lives, before introducing the comedian's comedian and avant garde comedy genius, Simon Munnery. In a frank interview Simon reveal the unwritten truth of Steve Coogan's 1992 Edinburgh Fringe hospital visit, how Mark Lamarr did the bravest thing ever witnessed on stage, how Simon met his wife as a voice in the darkness during a gig that was spiralling out of control, setting up a restaurant that doesn't serve food, and what it was like to play Malcolm Hardee's legendary Tunnel Club. There's a bit where he looks like he might try to punch Richard to the floor, but instead they settle the battle of the aged Alpha males in the most manly way possible. Munnery is the comedy god, but who is the strongest? It's a thrilling podcast in many ways, and some of it maybe better watched than listened to, but luckily you can do both.

He makes a bold prediction that we can only hope has come to pass, before introducing the never efficiently researched Susan Calman. There's chat about the loneliness of touring, the terror of the new world order and what it might mean for minorities and whether we need more diversity on television. It gets pretty serious in places, but there's lots of fun chat about filthy Miriam Margolyes, having a drink with Cliff Richard, eskimo rolls, Princess Anne's bun and whether it's really necessary to apologise to everyone for absolutely every joke.

The pair chat about Wikipedia-based factual inaccuracies, the true story of how Chris was nearly Doctor Who, the technical realities of sewing people together anus to mouth, some thoughtful exposition about a world with realistic robots, whether opera is obviously shit or if it's actually good, why American TV produces the results that the UK seemingly can't, as well as having a smack down between the average Herring and Addison fans. And can Rich Columbo Chris at the end? Product placement courtesy of http://www.hiphops.cards/ - seriously, check out the guy doing the song about how to play the game. It's magic!

Richard's guest is the home-schooled, Benedict Cumberbatch botherer, Caitlin Moran. Caitlin discusses her ambitious plans to kickstart the cancelled yet award-winning Raised By Wolves (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raisedbywolves/save-the-wolves), (the show has been bumped up in the schedule so apologies for any minor disruptions of running jokes), how she nearly broke into Kate Moss' house, why you shouldn't give an 18 year-old a TV show, possibly the most unconvincing ghost story so far, and how she used numerology to help her choose her name. Ally has a question about feminism that is very offensive, but you have to remember that he is from another time. There are still four shows left to be filmed.

It's the end of the series (but there will be bonus audio podcasts from the Great Yorkshire Fringe next week) and Richard is frankly astonished by the popularity of his final guest, given he has to literally check his name on a pad before introducing him, it's Elis James. Rich makes the Welshman feel at home by talking to him in his own language before discussing the famous people who've come from Carmarthen and the impact of the bridge over Blue Street. They compete to discover the worst hotel in Swansea and Elis wins by a toothbrush. Also find out how James' act has been ruined by Welsh football success, what we thought of the Ghostbusters controversy (I know that was a long time ago now) and who will have the funniest comedy hybrid child. And who is more oppressed, the Welsh or women? Or Welsh women? Plus Richard's attempt to get involved with Elis' next sitcom backfires spectacularly, but at least he has his awards speech all ready now.</itunes:summary>

The pair discuss the lengths that you would have to go to to out-vegan a vegan, why someone from Wolverhampton shouldn't advertise toothbrushes, another amazing kite story, the woes of the Labour party and what it's like to work under the dictatorial heel of Robert Webb. Also if you've ever wondered if Tom Parry has tried sushi then you're in for a treat. And here's hoping Windsor Davies hasn't succumbed to the curse of 2016 so you can still make the important choice that we're all having to make about him. Some nice stuff about directing comedy and the insecurities, competitiveness and joys of working with other comedians and whether you ever get too old to dick around.</itunes:summary>

Richard is reduced to tears of laughter during a very inappropriate bit of chat (but is it really that funny, or is he just tired?) and after that catharsis there is some serious late night chat about success and working with other people, before the pair wonder about buying a stunt kite.

The guest is Richard's backdoor neighbour (no, literally), Nish Kumar. They discuss working with Blue in Ibiza, the kinds of things that go on on Alan Carr's New Year Specstaculars, Bush based egging and shitting, what Nish and his girlfriend were in deep discussion about when Rich passed them at the Westfield the previous day, worrying post-Brexit developments and the difficulty of maintaining anger when you're successful. Also we find out about the St Olave's Grammar School Comedy Mafia and appearing in a groundbreaking production of Waiting For Godot (coincidentally alongside next week's guest).

The guest is Richard's backdoor neighbour (no, literally), Nish Kumar. They discuss working with Blue in Ibiza, the kinds of things that go on on Alan Carr's New Year Specstaculars, Bush based egging and shitting, what Nish and his girlfriend were in deep discussion about when Rich passed them at the Westfield the previous day, worrying post-Brexit developments and the difficulty of maintaining anger when you're successful. Also we find out about the St Olave's Grammar School Comedy Mafia and appearing in a groundbreaking production of Waiting For Godot (coincidentally alongside next week's guest).

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #108 Cheg On! Susie Dent. Rich is surprised by the sartorial elegance of some of his audience. Being out of Europe is clearly paying dividends. His guest this week is a woman who has been on TV more consistently than possibly anyone else over the last 25 years, Susie Dent. It's more intellectual than usual, but there's plenty of stuff about cocks in it, so don't worry. Find out about the rudest words in the dictionary, the cruder rival to Doctor Johnson, plus Rich attempts to get some words added to the dictionary, partly so he can cheat at Scrabble. Lots of chat about quizzing and TV gameshows as always, plus the advantages of going to bed with a lexicographer, and Richard reveals a bit too much about his latest obsession with Rebecca from CBeebies. Plus news of how England did in the last 16 of the Euros! You will be the first to hear.

Last week's jokes about the consequences of Brexit seem to have fallen on stony ground with the revelation that the pro-Remain audience has been executed by Farage's goons, but the show must go on, even if some of the audience were foolish enough to give up their tickets to watch the football (ha!), so they missed the force of nature that is Vic Reeves. There's a danger the whole podcast might just be a chat about Britain's best and worst tourist attractions, but luckily things move on to Luis Bunuel, where comedy meets art, what a baboon sounds like when it ejaculates, whether Sue Lawley liked Vic and a potential return of the Big Night Out! Also Terry Scott lookalikes, ghostly orbs, eating humous and the Moir family history. Plus what it's like to be a magnet for serial killers. And you can find out what the score of the England/Iceland game was at half time too. It was 1-2.

Starstruck and clearly in disbelieving awe, Rich flounders around and mainly embarrasses himself, but luckily Mr Cross is able to come up with some amazing riffed comedy about frozen vegetables, Abraham and taking cocaine near President Obama, whilst getting a bit more serious about Donald Trump, the responsibilities of fatherhood, why Richard should probably not take hard drugs, the benefits of the middle-aged sketch show and David's part in the creation of Kickstarter. Richard hoped that he would so impress David that they would become good friends and could appear in Doctor Dolittle 3 together as method-acted monkeys, but I think it's safe to say that that will not happen. Cross put away an impressive amount of bitter during this podcast and still remains focused and coherent, but clearly needed the toilet near the end, which turns into a battle of the obstinately pedantic 1990s underrated sketch show stars.

It's a frank, fascinating and unusually sensitive chat taking in growing up in North London as a geeky mixed race kid, why it's not fair to use talent to get ahead of the other talentless stand-ups, working with Ricky Gervais, how producer Ben helped keep Doc's career on track (and why hasn't he done the same for Richard) and trying to work out why Doc Brown's family are such a hotbed of artistic skill. Find out what you have to do to get on to CBeebies and what Doc would jump into a pool of and if he's capable of spotting the colour purple. Once again the emergency questions copied off the internet prove more effective than Richard's rubbish ones.

It's like his brain is a radio and someone is constantly swivelling the dial so that one moment you're on history, then fantasy, then insanity and then pinpoint sane philosophy. It's a discombobulating journey to go on, especially if, like Richard, you're getting a bit tired, but Herring gamely attempts (and largely fails) to get some questions in. In the end he more or less gives in, but Law is an unstoppable force of nature and cannot be silenced. Though the fear is that, at any point, something might happen to upset the fragile mental balance that somehow remains teetering on equilibrium... and that thing might very well be Desert Island Dicks.

Finally, when the conversation turns to the supernatural things start to make sense. But Richard is knocked out and defeated and was right to say he wasn't looking forward to writing this blurb.

Richard is back (in his weightier incarnation) and has forgotten how to do this, but is excited about the possibilities of growing body parts in pigs, but worried about the implications of penis transplants, so it's business as usual, but with some new (but the same) emergency questions.

His guest is the Wild Man of radio (and must always be referred to as such), Iain Lee. The pair discuss the pointless 17 year grudge that has hung over them, their mutual envy and the disastrous filmed meeting in 2001 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakeVejvR3I), but they are united by their relative lack of success compared to their nineties contemporaries and after all this time attempt to heal the rift betwixt them.

In an attempt to fill in Iain's early life on Wikipedia they discuss the perils of going to a school named after William Herschel, what it was like living in the town where Buddy's Song was filmed, and how to embarrass yourself in front of Roger Daltry.

Richard tries to steer the Monkees-based conversation towards Metal Mickey (no doubt to discuss if it would be cheating to have sex with him), but Lee skilfully swerves and ends up talking about Monkey instead.

There is also a frank discussion about whether the BBC were right or clearly wrong to sack Lee and the effects this had on his career and psyche. Good to be back.

Richard tries to steer the Monkees-based conversation towards Metal Mickey (no doubt to discuss if it would be cheating to have sex with him), but Lee skilfully swerves and ends up talking about Monkey instead.

There is also a frank discussion about whether the BBC were right or clearly wrong to sack Lee and the effects this had on his career and psyche. Good to be back.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #100: Richard Bacon - A Series of Apologies. It's the 100th Leicester Square Theatre Podcast and the last in this series, so we've flown a special guest in all the way from America at the licence fee payer's expense, it's Blue Peter's bad boy, Richard Bacon. And in typical fashion he turns up at the theatre having been out all night celebrating his imminent 40th birthday. Where does he get his energy from?... oh right.

Find out about how he once cried salty tears on to Mansfield McDonald's salty gherkins, how he became Top Of The Pop's most notorious ever presenter by accidentally calling some people fat, why he has been banned from the state opening of parliament, how he took a forgetful plate-spinner to Las Vegas, what he knows about the Tales of Robin Hood, what part of his anatomy (other than his mouth and nose) he can breathe out of, and why this gives him another kinship with Herring on top of his Dicky first name and food-based surname. Plus what he REALLY thinks of Una Stubbs (he thinks she's nice). And he gives himself something else to apologise for in a lifetime of apology. He's a very entertaining and lovely idiot, but as you'll see, it's all down to genetics. Hard to believe his one attempt at stand up-ended so badly.

If you think these 100 podcasts have been worth 1p each, why not donate a pound here: www.gofasterstripe.com/badges. Feel free to give more if you like or to donate monthly. We'll use all your money to make even more stuff like this.</itunes:summary>

Richard is exhausted again because of his stupid, idiot daughter, but at least she's given him the excuse to finally get to have a go at soft play. He's got 99 problems, but his 99th guest isn't one, it's the multi-talented actor and improviser, Cariad Lloyd. There's another dissection of the short film Hallo Panda which Richard once again promises to watch, even though he clearly won't, plus find out what it's like to be a fan working on Peep Show, the abrasive character of genius improviser Ken Campbell, how George Osborne comes to Fringe shows in the hope of getting pencils, how Cariad very nearly destroyed the marriage of David Bowie, and what connects Taylor Swift and the tax on tampons. Plus there's some more serious chat about whether the BBC can survive (don't worry, they're not watching) and some less serious chat about how much it would cost to employ a successful comedy actor as a Christmas elf (as well as the danger of working with Santas who've been in James Bond films).

Find out why the new Muppets are offensive and wrong, if a house in Pontefract is really haunted and why being childish is a good thing.

It's David's second time in the hot seat (though the chairs have got nicer since he was last here) and Richard is determined not to be as childish and rude to him as he was last time. But will he be able to keep a lid on the simmering mayonnaise vat of bitterness? Find out if David swears during sex, if he would allow himself to be raped by a ghost, why he's so obsessed with war that he's apparently wearing a poppy in January and if he enjoyed working the cloakroom for TFI Friday. There are also some more serious chats about the mindset of someone who paps a couple going for a walk with their baby and why there is so much antipathy towards Ben Elton. But it's possibly the funniest episode yet, with Mitchell, once again, giving possibly the definitive answers to some of the emergency questions. What a treat.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #91: Phill Jupitus - (Never Mind) (The) (Buzzcocks). Richard has written his first joke of 2015 and can't wait to share it with the underwhelmed audience, but luckily he is riding high from his incredible level of public recognition on Pointless Celebrities. His guest is the immaculately dressed and multi-talented Phill Jupitus, who isn't so good with names. They chat about giving U2's new song a minute of air play, whether stand-up is harder than acting, how the most difficult person to please is always your mum and why the BBC is doomed. Get the behind the scenes info on Buzzcocks' guests Jedward and Jamelia and witness an old emergency question morph into something new and even more disturbing. Lots of funny stories and a great Mark Steel impression. It's worth subscribing to the monthly badge (www.gofasterstripe.com/badges) for the backstage chat too.</itunes:summary>

Richard is unnecessarily unpleasant to someone in the audience (what's new?) before quickly bringing on a man with a drive that burgeons on insanity, but it's the good kind of insanity, Eddie Izzard. It's an unsurprisingly sprawling but incredible conversation that takes us through why God doesn't reveal himself, through the clumsy religious allegories of CS Lewis, through what kind of madness would make a man run 43 Marathons in 51 days, how to pronounce Calippo, how Eddie would have fared in the army, his political ambitions and philosophy, performing in languages that you were recently unable to speak, the short-sighted nature of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, the years of struggling to make it (with some great stories about his street theatre days) and why the world needs to come together and give everyone hope. It's electrifying and inspirational and Richard hardly says anything (because he's not an idiot who is going to waste this opportunity).

Richard is amazed how a joke on Twitter now pretty much always gets taken at face value by someone, even if it's in an open letter to an 8 month-old baby. His guest is Nicole Kidman impersonator and fantastically thoughtful yet and puerile stand-up Sarah Kendall, fresh from her nomination for the big comedy award at the Fringe. They discuss the horrors of child birth, the redundancy of the hand job, growing up in New Newcastle, how audiences can sometimes laugh in the wrong way, the plot holes in Back To The Future, loads of stuff about cocks and vaginas (obviously), the inevitability of nuclear destruction, plus some surprisingly serious bits about the nature of being a stand-up. To be honest, most of the time we forgot that we weren't sitting in the lounge in our Edinburgh flat having the kind of conversations with one another that are totally unacceptable in the actual world. She's the best. Go and see her perform live. You're welcome.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #81: Joe Lycett - A Fan Who's Won a Competition. It's the last show in Series 7 and there's an end of term atmosphere and a lot of good natured heckling from a slightly inebriated crowd. Richard's final guest is Peter Dickson impersonator and product of 1988, Joe Lycett. The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise. But there's also time to talk about identifying fish as they are slapped into your face, how much money Richard turned down to appear on TV with Katie Hopkins and the varying depravity of ex Blue Peter presenters. It's a fittingly low key and relaxed end to the series. Series 8 starts next week.</itunes:summary>

If you read his book you might worry the same thing about this week's guest, cult comedy genius and normal-faced man Limmy. The pair try and fail to remember an ancient Twitter spat, and Richard threatens to reignite it by trying to welcome his guest by talking to him in his own language. There's a lively discussion of Scottish politics, the sexual allure of fake tan and whether it's funny to envisage the death of your own father.

Giving away a prize to a lucky audience member, Rich reminisces about schoolday bags and realises how much work he has got to do to re-learn his 11 old stand-up shows for his insane attempt to do them all at the Leicester Square Theatre in August and September. His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge.

Giving away a prize to a lucky audience member, Rich reminisces about schoolday bags and realises how much work he has got to do to re-learn his 11 old stand-up shows for his insane attempt to do them all at the Leicester Square Theatre in August and September. His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history. It's really good.</description>

With a bad choice of words Richard almost Merchants the podcast early on and the interviewer becomes the interviewee as Herring gets Therouxed and opens up about his pre-marital life. Will he be the subject of one of Louis' future documentaries? Can there be a more insulting thing to happen to a person, given the broken people Louis generally focuses on? Louis' interview with Jimmy Savile is analysed in depth. Should he have spotted the monster lurking beneath the surface?

In this and the next podcast Richard is catching up with some of the stars of the failed 1990s comedy show, This Morning With Richard Not Judy. Next week it's one of the more minor figures, but this time we have the Curious Orange and the Small-Faced Boy, Paul Putner and Trevor Lock. The triumvirate remember the Edinburgh Fringe 1997, with the stage version of TMWRNJ which led to the TV series and how Trevor and Paul had Richard's penis waved in their face on a daily basis (in a play). They chat about how they were both witnesses and would-be saboteurs to the burgeoning romance between Richard and his one-time Shrine-based obsession, Julia Sawalha. We also chat about the special relationship that Trevor enjoyed with Nathalie and Paul's specialised expertise in performing as russet coloured disembodied heads. And find out what he thinks about the Annoying Orange.

The triumvirate remember the Edinburgh Fringe 1997, with the stage version of TMWRNJ which led to the TV series and how Trevor and Paul had Richard's penis waved in their face on a daily basis (in a play). They chat about how they were both witnesses and would-be saboteurs to the burgeoning romance between Richard and his one-time Shrine-based obsession, Julia Sawalha. We also chat about the special relationship that Trevor enjoyed with Nathalie and Paul's specialised expertise in performing as russet coloured disembodied heads. And find out what he thinks about the Annoying Orange.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #61: Ben Goldacre - I Think You'll Find It's More Complicated Than That. Richard has bought (and definitely not shoplifted) a present for this week's guest, the author who thinks you'll find it's more complicated than that, Ben Goldacre. It's a change of pace from the usual podcasts, with some serious chats about medicine, quacks, how a dead cat became a doctor and the ways that data and statistics can be abused. But there's still time for Goldacre to raise questions about his sexuality, talk about his pop star mum and discuss his 'friend's' attempts at autofellatio. Can nutritionists work out your allergies by moving your limbs? Are Beroccas just homeopathy for sceptics? Is Lancaster a real place? Is it possible to get a simple yes or no answer as to whether you should wear a cycle helmet? I think you'll find it's more complicated than that.</itunes:summary>

Al Murray had to drop out due to illness and so Rich was forced to find a new guest who could get to central London in an hour. And that guest was Michael Legge - no, not the one from the film Angela's Ashes or the blind or deaf Hereford-based massage therapist. The one from the Bollings and Nerrin Podcast. I can only apologise. But it turns out that the podcast might be even better with no preparation (ha, as if there's any anyway) and last second bookings cos Michael has funny stories about how he copes with people playing music on the bus, falling out with Robin Ince, Richard's inability to clap, and why he won't eat stuff that's come out of an animal. And there's more serious chat about the rise of the new-sexism in comedy and an almost entirely successful comedy of nostalgia about a show that nobody in the audience seems to have heard of. It gets awkward and weird, but they push through that and find some funny stuff again. He's no Al Murray and he might not even be the Michael Legge that you're thinking of, but he was the best we could do in the time available.</itunes:summary>

His guest is the ubiquitous and claustrophobic Rebecca Front, a woman who has appeared in all manner of award-winning TV and Radio roles, but never, it seems, if Richard has been involved in the production too. You'll discover the confusion that can be caused by a mistimed fan shouting out one of your catchphrases, what Patrick Marber is really like to work with, how Morse will never be allowed to die and what happened when Lauren Bacall ate one of her husband's chips. Rich is embarrassed to ask his usual stupid, sexual questions to someone he considers to be purer than the Virgin Mary, especially when her 15 year-old son is in the audience. But he still asks them. Because he is trapped in a nightmare of his own making that he can't escape. And was 'You Can Choose Your Friends' one of the great lost TV series or the worst thing ever to be on television (according to the Evening Standard)?

Rich has some surprising and life-changing news to share, but that doesn't mean that gloves (and pants if it's cold enough) aren't off for the annual sparring match with TV's Sarah Millican. Who will win the flirtatious/offensive battle of wits this time? You'll find out why she appeared on TV without her underwear, why she kept her first husband's name, and be asked to consider whether she was unreasonable when she refused to tell a journalist her exact address. And would her DVDs sell better if she included a free sample of her own excrement? But you will learn more about Rich than his interviewee this week, because he was a bit tired and unable to control his mouth or brain. What does he have for breakfast on tour? Who was right and who was wrong during Cornetto-gate? Is money real or a meaningless abstract? And what happens if he ceases to be before he sees his own sexcrement?

But he will soon forget his woes when he chats to the great-grandaughter of music writer Rosa Newmarch (and you never know who her great-grandfather might have been), Sara Pascoe. In what is one of Rich's favourite ever RHLSTPs the chat encompasses whether a vegan can eat a ham hand, how a six foot tall penis man would cope with his terrible life, what it's like to be part of a younger generation of comedians who are about to storm the comedy citadel and claim their rightful crown, and why there should be more women on Would I Lie To You?. Sara and Richard chat about how they fell in love (with other people) as their significant others possibly get together in the darkness of the auditorium.

But he has a very special guest to help him celebrate his half century of RHLSTPs, it's the go-to guy if you want someone to play a small toy figure, Steve Coogan. A-ha! (Steve loves it when people do that). They chat about getting laughs at the Leveson Enquiry, why so many people that Steve has done impressions of have ended up in gaol, Stewart Lee's Partridge-inspiring encounter with a superfan and why 'Around the World in 80 Days' really needed more martial arts in it. And finally we're going to find out who created Alan Partridge. Will Steve pay Richard the 250,000 he demands in royalties? No he won't.

Psychic Richard manages to divine the life of someone in his front row merely by looking at him, though what he finds out about this person's nipples will change your life forever. His guest this week is the Rod Hull faced comedian James Acaster. You will find out what it's like to survive three car crashes and two train derailments, how much you could expect to earn selling slurpies in Kettering in the 1990s and what it is that draws the police to conspiracy theorists. Acaster also completely Mitchells the new emergency question. But has he ever seen a Bigfoot? You'll have to wait until the end of the podcast to find out. But it's unlikely I reckon.

Inevitably there is a lot of discussion about obscure 1970s TV and Tim from The Office being in Sherlock and you'll find out which Doctor Who monster Mark would most like to have sex with. But other questions include: How did Mark prepare for the role that made him famous, the voice of Greg Evigan on TMWRNJ? What characters DIDN'T make it into the League of Gentlemen? What is the biggest fossil that he has ever discovered? Should Rich buy a metal detector? And there's a terrifying real-life ghost story, and more on conspiracy theories. It's gentle and largely dignified, as one would expect from two middle-aged men with colds and bad backs.

There's some interesting conspiracy theories revolving around Beyonce, what it's like to work in Hooters, the dirty protests at a Crouch End Primary School, the stupidity of American tourists using their children as bear-bait, and as she's from Canada so she's got to have seen a BigFoot, right?

The pair carry out some onstage sex acts which will delight the perverts on Dirty Britcom Confessions (if you buy one of the series on video you might want to make it this one) and disgust all decent minded people. You will find out how the team of Uncle got round BBC compliance issues, what to do in St Albans when your dreams have been shattered, where the Bermuda Triangle of the Edinburgh Fringe is, what it's like to perform there, and experience a ham-hand based pun that it's astonishing hasn't been stumbled across before now. All this and there's a chance that the series will end with the mysterious death of someone in the theatre. We will be back with another series of the show in September and there's a special from the Mach Fest coming next week. Fill the void in your life with some Richard Herring's Meaning of Life.

An almost imperceptibly slimmer than the beginning of the series Richard Herring takes the stage to find a slightly sinister pair of men in the front row. What do they do? Do we really want to know? No, because the guest this week is journalist, screen-writer and broadcaster Jon Ronson who is a man with some good stories. Find out what happened when he met the politically correct arm of the KKK, was outed as a Jewish man whilst with jihadists in Crawley, how he went UFO Spotting with Robbie Williams, was chased by the Bilderberg group's less expert henchmen and how being keyboardist for Frank Sidebottom led to him writing his latest film. Also what was in Stanley Kubrick's archive, visiting a dado-masochist porn set and being confused with Louis Theroux. Plus Jon comes armed with his own emergency question, which to be honest Richard totally nails.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #43: Susan Calman - Helen Mirren Mask. Richard is still a bit giddy and over-excited from meeting Harry Shearer and, after being on his best behaviour for 75 minutes, is now off the leash and at his most childish and pathetic. And who dares walk into this hurricane of smut? Only Susan Calman... who feels, possibly correctly, that she isn't being given the respect of the previous guest. Find out how one of the tallest comedians in the UK snuck one of the smallest into a party, how Richard is planning to win the Gay Celebrity of the Year 2015, who has the tiniest hands in comedy, and if you watch the video you'll get to see the ultimate guide to fingering. In spite of Richard offending the Scottish, the Chinese and Susan's dead grandma, there's no real danger of Richard 'doing a Merchant' and somehow they manage to steer the puerile conversation towards depression and Section 28. Plus which celebrity would you like to stroke your hair as you die? And more on the proposed Edinburgh Fringe show where Rich and Susan are forced to have sex with each other, against both of their wills.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #42: Harry Shearer - Creative Differences. Richard has some news of an amazing time travelling finger and is clearly super excited to be meeting one of his all-time comedy heroes, Harry Shearer from off of This is Spinal Tap and The Simpsons. Rich was too scared to talk to him when he saw him improbably travelling on London's Tube, but hopefully he won't just sit quietly, staring at him and saying nothing this time. The pair discuss Harry's career which seems to break the space-time continuum as he's worked with such legends as Abbott and Costello, Jack Benny and Mel Blanc. Why does Derek Smalls wrap his courgette in tin foil and what's his affiliation with Shrewsbury Town? How much creative control do the actors on The Simpsons have over the characters they have helped create? Is stubbornness a pro or a con when trying to make it in show business? What is the Jerry Lewis film, "The Day The Clown Cried" really like? Will we hear from Simpsons character Hugh Jass? It's an amazing interview with a driven and hilarious genius man. And Harry Shearer is in it too.

Richard is still recovering from his important educational work on International Women's Day, but luckily he isn't going to be taxed by having to speak very much, because his guest is the loquacious and unsinkable Danny Baker. In a show overflowing with content you will find out, amongst much else, about a laserdisc signed by David Bowie, how Danny's amazing dad took umbrage with Harry Enfield, where talcum powder comes from, how to go to Hawaii with no money in the bank and how surviving cancer taught Danny nothing. Is Baker responsible for Bob Marley's demise? Is having no ambition or plan the key to showbiz success? Can you do a consumer affairs programme if you have sympathy with the villains? Is there any point in me trying to list all the stuff that happened? Baker is an amazing force of nature. This one could have gone on for days.

Don't worry, the nerds are still there and they're still the best! This week's guest is very tall and has never been told that before, it's sexually-charged comedian and actor Greg Davies. They converse about how W G Grace upstaged Greg's sister's wedding, how Guy Fawkes died and whether he'd welcome a time-travelling penis, how Greg embarrassed himself in front of Rik Mayall in a supermarket and bum-based encounters with doctors. It's raucous and very funny. This is one that might be worth paying the £3.50 to see on video. Not only does Greg have some amazing facial reactions, but Richard carries out one of the dirtybritcom confession fantasies on him. It's very, very sexy.

Not only does Greg have some amazing facial reactions, but Richard carries out one of the dirtybritcom confession fantasies on him. It's very, very sexy.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #38: Alexei Sayle - Mouse Killing Alarm Clock. Richard has a pus-filled finger, which is disgusting even in audio, but that doesn't stop the people at Dirtybritcom Confessions pretending to fantasise about him. His guest recently referred to him as one of his 'comedy children', but let's see how far his paternal feelings will stretch, it's the legendary Alexei Sayle. They chat about being expelled from school, why Guildford is funnier than Hatfield, getting Christmas cards from a man who has played chess with death, Keith Allen using his audience as a dartboard (and getting his cock out a lot), why Alexei's cat can never hope to play Sherlock and how his mum can't tell him from a rubber dwarf.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #37: Robert Llewellyn - Charlie Chaplin's Lasts. Richard meets his audience, who are predictably much better than last week's to discover a disconcerting leap in the attractiveness and coolness of the people in the front row. Also apparently the queue for the women's toilet was longer than the one for the men's. Something is changing in the world of this podcast and we should all be very afraid. Robert Llewellyn from Red Dwarf and Carpool is the charming and engaging guest. They discuss how the right-on comedy troupe 'The Joeys' got their name, science fiction in which the future is better than the present, a slightly disturbing use of time travelling genitalia, a near fatal car crash, the weirdness of being recognised from behind and how to escape from prison with a piss-drenched shirt. The Big Foot question finally comes good after so many attempts. I told you it was worth it.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #36: Helen and Olly from Answer Me This! - Okapi Sandwich. Richard is bristling from more anarchic behaviour in the swimming pool and pitching ideas for Dragon's Den. His guests are Helen Zaltzman and Olly Mann from rival Sony Gold and Silver (but crucially not bronze) winning podcast Answer Me This. They seem to hold some kind of grudge for Richard having made them his enemies in the old Collings and Herrin podcasts, but as Richard was under the thrall of his Herrin character he can't really remember anything about that. Anyway, it's an old-fashioned podclash! The conversation scales the heady heights of time-travelling genitalia, British Forces Broadcasting and how to get sacked from the Lorraine show. Is semen a powerful cologne? What happens if you fall in love with someone in an oil painting? Has Helen married a ghost? Will Richard be bummed to death by the end of the show and how would Olly's bumming sushi carousel work in practice?

Richard gives his surprise mystery (to the audience at least) guest possibly the worst introduction known to mankind, but gigantic Stephen Merchant is more than a match for this tiny Somerset hobbit. The pair discuss big foot-based anal sex, the disappointing lack of shenanigans in the bar at the 1997 reboot of Blockbusters, setting up Jack Bauer's Facebook page, penis-length anxiety, how Stephen accidentally ended up shooting a porn film, the Wookey Hole paper-mill, what it's like picking up Ricky Gervais' Bafta and the rigours of filming with Halle Berry. Tim from The Office might get a mention. Due to Richard getting a bit overtired and overexcitable it goes a bit weird towards the end, but Stephen has achieved a lot of success through the comedy of embarrassment, so it's nice for him to witness some at such close quarters. You are going to enjoy Richard trying to dig himself out the hole he creates and doesn't seem to want to escape. It's an awkward end to a fun series of which Richard is both proud and ashamed. We'll be back in February with more. Thanks for listening and thanks to Chris Evans (not that one) and his team, Ben Walker, and the Leicester Square Theatre for all their support.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #31: Ross Noble - Trojan Badger. The company director with the sexiest voice in the world is in the front row and Richard is needlessly rude to his less sexy fans. His guest is one of the world's greatest improvisers, Ross Noble. Richard shows how hard interaction can be by failing to find anything funny to say about the rest of the front row. But luckily from there on in, he is not going to get a word in edgeways as Ross talks non-stop for approaching 100 minutes about TGI Friday's, what it's like to own a tank, convincing his daughter that he's a wizard, why you can't trust Twitter to provide medical advice, why he's more Geordie than Cheryl Cole and how difficult it is to peel potatoes when all your possessions have been destroyed. There are also pyres of burning animals and mad cow leather trousers and criticisms of a hopefully still living Bruce Forsyth. Can Ross get comedy gold where Richard failed by interrogating a child therapist in the front row or can it only end in disaster? Can the pair keep the podcast going forever? Is it still going on now? Will you ever be able to catch up?</itunes:summary>

And there's more online comment as the pair discuss the sexual fantasies that comedy fans harbour on Dirty Britcom Confessions. There's also chat about how to cope with fatalities on aeroplanes, whether it was worth almost dying on the Zambezi to stop African children being able to play, the paradoxes of digit-based time travel and the truth about goose rescuing myths.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #29: Miles Jupp - What IS the Story in Balamory? Richard tells a story of a terrifying prediction made by an Armenian fortune teller and is needlessly insulting to a dead broadcaster before introducing this week's guest, Miles Jupp. Although Jupp has appeared in films with George Clooney and Jon Stewart and won plaudits for his stage and TV work, Richard is keen to talk to him about the children's television show, Balamory, and NOTHING ELSE. The audience do not share the host's fascination with this lazily acted, repetitive show for pre-schoolers, but Herring's view is clouded by watching it in a fun of alcoholic despair, so it made him question the very nature of being. Don't worry, the Balamory part only lasts about 25 minutes, so there's still at least an hour of chat about divinity, the Harry Potter franchise, tea tasting and fly fishing, Miles' suspiciously late booking for the podcast and a bizarre phobia of lettuce. You'll also find out some of the good things that terrorists have said and done and witness Richard losing the ability to speak and the will to live as his half-marathon exhaustion finally overcomes him. At least he's not an Imp Pervert.

There aren't many flies around, but a game member of the audience agrees to be zapped. May she rest in peace. Richard is still a bit sore from running a half-Marathon (sponsor him here - http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/RichardHerring) in the record breaking time of under 2 hrs 38 minutes, but has a guest who has run 100 metres in just over 12 seconds, Miranda Hart. The pair last appeared together in the short film, A Very British Cult, in which Richard was the STAR, so let's just remember that and none of the stuff that's happened subsequently. They also chat about the different comedy they have created from falling into graves, being mistaken for the wrong gender, laughing at inappropriate times and Miranda's trial for QPR. There's a further exciting evolution for the ham hand/suncream armpit question (which leaves ham and armpits behind) and a treat for fans of the opening credits of some of the series of Not Going Out (that's just Richard then).</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #22: Edgar Wright - Spaced By The Bell. At last it's the podcast that addresses the burning issue of modern Britain - which is the best Somerset based show cave complex? Cheddar Gorge (obviously) or rubbishy old Wookey Hole. It'd be a shame to have Britain's most exciting film director on the show without wasting most of the time talking about this and the obscure and sexist Roald Dahl short story - Switch Bitch. And Richard hates to disappoint. Luckily he occasionally manages to blunder into discussing Wright's canon of work, from A Fistful of Fingers through Asylum, some ideas for a new series of Spaced, right up to the amazing new film The World's End. But there's still time to talk about what it's like to be taught by both parents, desecrating the graves of your former employers and Rich's ideas to reboot Goodnight Sweetheart and We Will Rock You before Edgar has to dash off to finish off his new film. But is there time to add a shrek?</itunes:summary>

Obviously you mainly ask him about ham hands. But that can only fill 40 or so minutes, so as well as that they discuss the author of Catweazle, how many hours of childhood they jointly wasted playing one-player Subbuteo, why on earth Russell wanted to appear in a remake of Arthur, how to be good at sex (though you'll have to study the video version to find out), what's beyond the boundaries of comedy, if throwing rat gizzards into an audience is comedic lunacy or genius, Jimmy Savile, wanking off a man in a toilet, plus an attempt to get an exclusive about Katy Perry's wee. The audience show their ignorance of how to make bronze and Richard Carpenter (not that one). The Welsh children question writers continue to demonstrate that their Stephen Fry triumph was a flash in the pan. There's jokes and philosophy from this complex, brilliant, ridiculous, fragile, eloquent, beautiful man. Also Russell Brand is in it (I am funny).</itunes:summary>

Or something. It gets brain-hurtingly deep and philosophical as both men attempt to discover the meaning of life. Plus there's some great behind the scenes stories from Not The Nine O'Clock News and Blackadder Goes Forth, Doctor Snuggles and the world of advertising. Does everything happen for a reason?

After last week's headline-grabbing show, Richard feels under pressure to coax revelations from his guest, classicist Mary Beard, but is a bit distracted by transport and atrocity based magazines. Instead he mainly talks about penises in Pompeii, realising that if only he could travel in time that he would be the most popular comedian in that knob-obsessed empire. But all the big historical questions are asked - why is Pan having sex with a goat? What did the people of Herculaneum use to wipe their bums? Where did Ancient Romans sleep? What were Julius Caesar's real last words? Is having sex with a statue the worst thing you can do? Mary also talks about Anus Arsehole Gill and how she fought back against the trolls, what words you can't say on Women's Hour and meeting the Queen with Bruce Forsyth. Back to normal then! If you want to see pictures of the various filthy archaeological discoveries then download the video at www.gofasterstripe.com/podcasts</itunes:summary>

Find out what the Spice Girls said to Prince Charles about Prince Albert, the favourite expletive of Lionel Jeffries, why Fabian is the best character in Twelfth Night, why Richard is going to graffiti Fry's grave, which women Steve wants to have sex with, Richard's clunky attempts to audition for QI (will be more of that next week). Richard's clunky attempts to refer to Mr Fry as Steve, whether you have to read The Hobbit to be in The Hobbit, the commercial possibilities of an Ann Widdecombe sex tape, what happened when the Bishop of Bath and Wells went to a prison for young offenders and the insecurity of John Travolta. Some brilliant additional questions by Ben Evans age 12. And properly poignant revelations about mental illness. It is mind-blowing and moving. If you end up killing David Cameron after this podcast then that is not our responsibility. Next week classicist Mary Beard plus QI, Not the Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder etc producer John Lloyd.

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP Extra - the Sony Awards. Unbelievably this stupid cock / hamhand / bigfoot-obsessed podcast got nominated for a Sony Comedy Award up against proper BBC comedy shows. But would it win? (spoiler alert - don't look at the picture).

Rich decided to try and get some value out of the £1200 it cost him to enter and attend the ceremony and, because his whole life must be documented, he made this into a podcast too. He interviews his competitors Isy Suttie, Rufus Hound and John Finnemore, and gets steadily more drunk (and is quite drunk at the start).

All the excitement, embarrassment and self-indulgence is captured on a digital recorder, including the moment when he found out if he'd won or lost. Also featuring our producer Ben Walker, wife Catie Wilkins and, producer of John Finnemore's show, Ed Morrish. And quite a lot of alcohol. This is why it's a good job that Rich stays sober for the regular podcasts.

The new series starts on May 27th with Chris Addison. You can listen to the audio for free as usual, or come along to the Leicester Square Theatre and be part of the audience or download a video of the evening from www.gofasterstripe.com/podcasts for a small fee (which will go to paying for the expense of filming). Do tell your friends.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>RHLSTP #16: Russell Howard - A Foreskin full of Haribo. It's the podcast so funny that it can make you go into labour. Even if you're not pregnant. Maybe one day it will eject a future monarch into the world. Rich is concerned about having his identity stolen the very week that he has bought an embarrassing item on the Internet. But clean-dicked Russell Howard has popped by to discuss the stuff that got cut from Banter, how he learned the facts of life, Badgerline and how he almost lost a thumb (and he didn't even have a ham hand!) There's a special surprise guest and some audience interaction and some quite specific heckle put downs. It's a cornucopia of West Country based comedians with the initials RH and find out the real reason Rich was sacked from Good News and what he nearly stole from Nick Grimshaw. Thanks for listening. The podcast will be back in May 2013.</itunes:summary>

It's the longest RHLSTP yet with Rich upstaged by his new butler, Siri and worrying about all the libel he has committed to the Internet in the past. But all the unpleasantness is quickly forgotten as the hair-loving, mane-biting star of The Persuasionists, Adam Buxton arrives. He has stories of his disastrous audition for Hitchhiker's Guide, being a bully in a china shop and how to quell a Dutch oven. The two small men swap stories about their funny and embarrassing dads, the humane imprisonment of children and discuss how much information you can get into a half hour TV show. Some new and contrived emergency questions and discover how putting a Tim from The Office in something does not always guarantee success. It's really lovely stuff, but it's loooong!

Slightly worse for wear after having lunch with Alice Cooper at the Q Awards, Richard is delighted to welcome a man he thinks might be him from another time stream, David 'Mitch' Mitchell. He's certainly met his match in pedantry and both men accidentally reveal some shocking details about their respective psyches. Never have two men discussed at such length the vagaries of choosing between a ham hand and a sun lotion arm pit. And that is GUARANTEED. The Peep Show stationery cupboard, romantic subterfuge and the Daily Mail readers' internet comments are all up for discussion and we'll find out how an early discussion about Eric Morecambe almost brought the pair to blows. Did Rich really meet some Shreks and a Justin Lee Collins in the street? And what was Tim from The Office like before he became Tim from The Office? Is Richard as bitter and mean as he seems and will he ever get a Googlewhack audience? What's it like to play Aerosmith at table tennis? Will Rich ever forgive his mum for her Brideshead Revisited Alfresco trump? Why don't the audience understand any of Richard's obscure 1980s references? What would you do if God granted you the power of having exactly the same hands as Hermione from Harry Potter? And just how many David Mitchells are there anyway? It's a marathon of a podcast, but there's no cheating and we both stay in it for the whole thing. It'd be nice if there was a happy ending. But there's a slightly unhappy ending. See if you can make it to the ending.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>Two tired men from the 1990s talking about sexy Jews, travelling with your cleaner, how David pronounces his own name wrong and the consequences of using people's real names in comedy routines.  Rich talks to David about the viciousness of some of the reviews he's received, whilst Baddiel turns the tables to quiz Herring about his murky and seedy sexual past. It's scintillating stuff as long as the exhausted host can stay awake long enough and no Victorian children come into the venue and arouse the double first Cambridge graduate. Find out David's middle name and if Kenneth Kendal is still alive. Fun for all the family... This might not be true.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>The sexual morals of Edwardian penguins are at the fore this week, as Richard interviews the star of Man Stroke Woman, but not Fatso in Casualty. We will hear the Star Wars impression that led to Frost's big break as well as spending an inordinate amount of time on his career as a waiter, where other interviewers might have been more interested in the big stars that Nick has worked with. But then no one else would ask him about self-fellatio either. There's a lesson in medieval history, protesting dwarves and criticism of a film scene involving comedy rape (from a man happy to discuss necrophiliac cloaca violation) and an attempt to drive a wedge between Frost and Pegg in the hope that Herring can appear in the next film in the Cornetto trilogy instead of Frost. It's Frost:Herring and it's electric stuff, so funny at one point that Rich himself wasn't sure he'd be able to continue. Hope you like it enough to continue listening.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>This weekend Rich has been working with 88 year-old Nicholas Parsons and Charlie has been working with 81 year old William Shatner, but now they've ditched the octogenarians to create this long and fairly filthy podcast. They chat about the humiliation of losing a BAFTA to Stewart Lee, what order you should have sex with the women from the Russian entry to the Eurovision song contest, the vengeance Rich wishes upon Charlie's young family and who Dominic West should really have been thanking. Plus some terrific tips for terrorists and some obscure stuff about archaic adverts and 50 year-old spoilers... It goes on for ages. But that can only be a good thing. In fact it might never end. It might still be happening now... Doesn't matter. We are all just a collection of atoms and everything we do is meaningless. Enjoy!</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:summary>It's podcast number 4 and Rich still can't pronounce his own acronym, but he's got his old 90s rival, Charlie Higson from The Fast Show, which some people might argue was more successful than Fist of Fun. But only some people (the others would not be aware of Fist of Fun). Jonathan Ross fell asleep whilst interviewing Higson, so Rich has his work cut out for him in this long chat with the Frome born comedian and author and ex-popstar.

But only a very few bits of this long chat could be used by Felicity to induce insomniacs into the arms of Morpheus as we examine the career of the man responsible for Loadsamoney, Swiss Toni and Young James Bond. Funnily enough we prove that pretty much anything can become a catchphrase and determine as best we can who is worse, Hitler or Ricky Gervais. Both comedians are hoping to get a cheese named after them, but only one of them has won the Chortle Internet Award and is thus the best. It's 100 minutes of fun, so more like Fist than Fast. And some of the running jokes will only make sense if you were one of the brave few who made it down to see the secret (astonishingly brilliant) first half.</itunes:summary>

Rich is angry about the Fringe programme censoring the entry for Talking C*ck (what can that word be?), but luckily Francesca Martinez is on hand to talk about the power of language, whether Ben Elton is stuck in the 80s and whether the concept of 'normal' exists anywhere but on a washing machine. She also reveals how Richard attempted to corrupt her in 2003 in Melbourne, but luckily she's still talking to him and speculates on whether Jonathan Ross has ever tried to suck his own penis. And Richard recounts the embarrassing interactions that he's had with his childhood hero Ben Elton and how awkward Sunday's gig for SCOPE (not what Elton calls it) at the Hammersmith Apollo on May 20th might be. Someone in the audience is going to win tickets to see the Stewart Lee podcast but what are the chances of them being related to someone on stage?</itunes:summary>

There's plenty to chat about from It Ain't 'Alf Hot Mum to the most popular piece of Paul Ross merchandise on Amazon to how on Earth did potty mouth Ross get an OBE? There's so much to discuss that Richard forgets to ask Ross if he's ever tried to suck his own cock? Luckily later on Twitter Jonathan wrote, 'No, I suspect I could have reached, but never been that hungry!'

Another episode recorded tonight will be available later this week.</itunes:summary>
