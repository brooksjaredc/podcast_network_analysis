It's like every five minutes, I'll be deep into listening to Jerry Jones giving inside knowledge about football when all of the sudden I see Kumail Nanjiani playing video games and bringing his positive attitude to the stage! Are you freaking kidding me? Being the nice Earwolf that The Sklars raised me to be, I kind of just kept reading about LeBron Jordan shoes and what a douchebaguette Cappie Pondexter is. I mean, I know, okay that sounds horrible, but if you're going to listen to a podcast about sports, music, and comedy at least make it Sklarbro Country!]]>
